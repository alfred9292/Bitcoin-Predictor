2015/6/30,The Fear of Capital Controls May be Spreading from Greece to Italy,"Yesterday, Bitcoin Magazine reported that Greece had closed its banks and imposed capital controls to prevent financial chaos after the breakdown of bailout talks with its international creditors. The decision came at the end of a weekend that brought Greece closer to “Grexit” – the potential exit from the Eurozone and perhaps the European Union (EU) itself – and confronted Europe with a serious crisis.

Today, Jose Pagliery, the author of “Bitcoin - And the Future of Money,” reports on CNN Money that Greeks are rushing to bitcoin. The article includes testimonials from top bitcoin exchanges such as bitcoin.de, Bitcurex, and China-based LakeBTC, stating that they are seeing a surge of business and inquiries from Greece.

This is, according to Pagliery, a pivotal moment. “Bitcoin was created as an independent, computerized money in 2009 to provide a stark alternative to government-issued currency held at banks,” he says. “This could be its moment to shine.”

The introduction of capital controls is likely to push people, not only wealthy investors but also ordinary people, to the conclusion that governments and banks couldn’t be trusted with their hard-earned savings. They may then start looking for alternative ways to store their savings, out of reach of predatory central banks, and choose bitcoin as the best alternative.

With limited access to their bank account and no legal way to transfer money abroad, the Greeks are likely to experience difficulties in buying bitcoin at the moment. But while it’s late for the Greeks who waited until now to act, other less optimistic Greeks have been buying bitcoin for some time now. In other countries, especially in neighboring European countries with troubled economies, it seems likely that people will begin to realize that the government can – and will – impose capital control and cut them from access to their savings if the economic situation worsens.

Based on real-time reports collected by The Wall Street Journal, Zero Hedge notes that the contagious fear of capital controls may already be spreading from Greece to neighboring Italy. Several Italian banks reportedly failed to start trading on Monday as fears over a Greek debt default induced many investors to shed peripheral stocks, including Italian, with banks suffering the most.

Sales orders on Italian stocks, in particular financial stocks, piled up before the market opening. At the start, the sales orders were so numerous that the system couldn't manage to process them, something that often happens when specific news causes a sell-off on a stock.

Speaking to Italian daily La Stampa, University of Chicago economist Luigi Zingales noted that a psychological contagion could spread immediately to Italy, because the Italian economy is not growing. “The question is: Would [Italians] too think to withdraw their money from the banks or not?”

La Stampa also reports that “The Bitcoin fever rises in Greece,” and mentions the recent April Fool’s joke of Greek Finance Minister Varoufakis: “Greece Will Adopt the Bitcoin If Eurogroup Doesn’t Give Us a Deal.” La Stampa describes similar scenarios as “unlikely, but potentially disruptive for Western economic culture.”.",Law & Justice,-0.9905
2015/8/17,False Alarm: Why The Japanese Ruling May Not Spell Doom for Bitcoin Ownership Rights,"This is a guest post by Drew Hinkes, an attorney at Berger Singerman. Drew is also frequently published and cited for his work on IT and technology-related issues, including virtual currencies, smart contracts, distributed ledger-based technologies, computer data security/breaches, and technology regulation.

Tokyo District Court Judge Masumi Kurachi recently rejected a claim for relief brought by a Kyoto man against the Mt. Gox bankruptcy receiver for bitcoin lost as a result of Mt. Gox’s collapse. In his ruling, Kurachi opined that bitcoin is “not subject to ownership.”

The court ruled that Japanese law allows only for proprietorship of “tangible entities that occupy space and which allow for exclusive control over them.” Since transactions of bitcoin require the involvement of a third party, exclusive control over bitcoins was not possible. Although the ruling seems dangerously misguided, it will likely be relegated to its own specific facts and not govern future disputes over bitcoin ownership.

Why This Opinion Seems Dangerous:

Taking the court’s conclusions about bitcoin at face value could create problematic results. Many assets, including stocks and bonds, transact through third parties. Most large-value transfers occur through the SWIFT network, which itself reduces value to intangible digital information. Many intangible assets such as trademarks, franchises, patents, consumer goodwill and contract rights are recognized as legally protectable assets worldwide. The logic of the recent ruling could potentially disturb long-understood concepts of property law, and drastically alter the legal status of many payment methods.

The court’s conclusion seems confused, or based on an improper understanding of bitcoin. Use of bitcoin requires only an Internet connection. Thus, it requires less intermediate infrastructure to use than a credit card. The court also appears to have misunderstood “ownership” of bitcoin. Although bitcoin itself may exist as intangible computer code, ownership and control of the private key providing access to a specific wallet functionally establishes exclusive ownership of whatever value is represented by the bitcoin held by that wallet. The court’s conclusions appear to be the result of an improper understanding of bitcoin.

However, as discussed below, the facts here are critical, and probably rescue this decision from having a long-term negative impact, or more widespread application.

A Digression About Japan’s Legal System…

Japan has a code-based legal system that differs from America’s common law legal system because courts in code-based legal systems generally cannot act in the absence of a specific applicable law. Prior decisions carry much less weight and generally do not bind judges determining future controversies.

In Japan, judges consider precedent to fill gaps or clarify the meaning of statutes, but precedent is generally non-binding.  Thus, if a similar claim was brought before a different district judge in Japan, that judge may not be compelled to rule the same way on the same issue.

Both systems provide the right to appeal decisions to a higher court. If this opinion is appealed in a timely manner, the higher court will reconsider the arguments and evidence submitted to the district court. Thus the outcome of this case, may be changed.

The All-Important “Why”:

Although the court’s conclusion seems wrong, it likely ruled to uphold the bankruptcy receiver’s power to control the disposition of Mt. Gox’s assets and avoid the need to untangle commingled assets.

Former Mt. Gox customers who claim they lost bitcoin can assert claims for recovery through the claims administration and investigation process set up by the Japanese bankruptcy receiver. The claims process, which closed on May 29, 2015, may result in claimants from Mt. Gox’s remaining assets.

The lawsuit could be viewed as a collateral attack or “end around” of the claims process, seeking to obtain a better result than would be available by submitting a claim. This sort of gambit is not available in the United States because debtors in bankruptcy liquidating assets through Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code are protected by an automatic stay of litigation pursuant to 11 U.S.C. §362.  This stay shuts down litigation against the bankrupt entity and establishes the bankruptcy (generally) as the exclusive means for claimants to recover against the debtor. Japanese bankruptcy law, however, does not provide the same stay unless it is requested by the debtor. The court’s ruling may have been intended to prevent an “end around” to the bankruptcy liquidation claims system.

Even if the lawsuit was not an attack on the bankruptcy claims process, the court may have dismissed it to avoid tracing and separating commingled bitcoin assets. Recent news from a self-professed insider suggests that Mt. Gox operated a single bank account. Other reports suggest that client wallets previously held on the site were commingled. The claim brought in district court may have required the bankruptcy receiver to attempt to identify specific coins among its commingled assets, which may be burdensome or impossible. The litigant’s request for the return of specific bitcoin, as opposed to cash, may have provided a second reason to deny the claim.

What This Opinion Means for the Future:

It is likely that this opinion will be limited to its facts. This was a claim alleging entitlement to bitcoin held by a third party in bankruptcy where specific identifiable assets sought by the claim may not have ever existed, and where relief was available through a bankruptcy claims process.  The very specific facts of this case may render the ruling not applicable to future claims regarding bitcoin.

Further, another lawsuit regarding bitcoin in Japan is unlikely to present the same facts. Finally, as noted by the Japanese Times, the presiding judge may have felt constrained because bitcoin is not directly addressed by any existing Japanese law. This suggests that the decision may have been a request to the National Diet of Japan to “fix” this opinion by creating law directly addressing virtual currencies. It remains to be seen whether this opinion will create valid precedent, or later be fixed through legislation.

Conclusion:

Although the headline is sensational, there are reasons to suspect that the opinion issued by Judge Kurachi may be limited to this specific lawsuit. Based on the structure of Japan’s legal system, the precedential value of the decision is limited, so that judges are not bound to the argument when deciding future disputes over ownership of bitcoin. Future cases could easily distinguish this case on its unique facts. Finally, because there is no specific law related to virtual currencies in Japan, the precedential value of this ruling may be mooted by future legislation.",Law & Justice,-0.9038
2016/10/19,"The Case Against Carl Force, or Why Prosecutors Seek Seven Years Imprisonment for a Corrupt Silk Road Investigator","Update: Carl Mark Force IV was sentenced to 6.5 years in prison today. While Force's defense asked for a sentence beneath statutory guidelines as it contended that Force's behavior was caused by alcoholism and mental health issues, Judge Richard Seeborg is said to have been highly skeptical of this excuse. In addition to the prison sentence, Force will need to pay $340,000 in restitution.

Thanks to Motherboard's Sarah Jeong (@sarahjeong) for reporting on the scene.

The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California is set to sentence 46-year-old Silk Road investigator Carl Mark Force IV this Monday .

It seems certain that the corrupt DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) agent will need to spend time behind bars. After having been arrested in March , he pleaded guilty to money laundering, obstruction of justice and extortion earlier this summer . Last week, prosecutors revealed they seek to lock the former law enforcement officer up for seven years, which they say is the maximum penalty within the applicable sentencing guidelines.

In a 10-page sentencing memorandum , the prosecution explains why only a high-end sentence would be appropriate for Force.

Reason #1: Force betrayed public trust.

The most important reason the prosecutors want to go hard on Force is that they believe the corrupt agent abused the public trust and tarnished the reputation of law enforcement in the process. The memorandum, which opens with a translated Latin maxim (“Corruption of the best is the worst”), argues that Force brutely violated the mandate given to him. A serious crime requiring serious sentencing, the prosecutors contend, not in the least because it reflects bad on all government officials.

According to the prosecution:

""In providing the defendant with a gun and a badge, the government entrusted him to act in a manner consistent with standards becoming a sworn law enforcement officer, namely to protect and serve the public. Conduct like Force’s undermines public confidence in law enforcement and threatens the credibility of the entire criminal justice system. Unfortunately, it does not take more than one or two corrupt federal agents to overshadow the consistent and heroic work done by 99.9% of their colleagues. The national media doesn’t publish articles about the agents who are the first responders in active shooter incidents, who risk their lives in undercover capacities, who respond to live hostage situations,who root out financial fraud and uncover terrorist plots – they publish articles about the corrupt behavior of people like Carl Force and [corrupt U.S. Secret Service agent] Shaun Bridges. Simply put, when the badge is tarnished it impacts every single law enforcement officer who wears it and every citizen who relies on it for protection.""

Reason #2: Force's conduct was long-lasting and consistent.

The second reason prosecutors are aiming for a maximum penalty within the applicable sentencing guidelines is that Force's criminal conduct was not a one-off, but a persistent behavioral pattern. Indeed, the corrupt agent's story can only be described as a long-lasting, bizarre, and incredible amassment of pathological disregard of the law. It's not without reason that Twentieth Century Fox recently bought the movie rights to his Silk Road investigation...

According to the sentencing memorandum:

""This Court comes across plenty of defendants who have committed a single – yet significant – error in judgment who might deserve a break when it comes time for sentencing. This is not one of those defendants. His crimes do not represent a “one-off” where he experienced a momentary lapse of judgment. Instead, Force committed crimes over the course of many months (if not years) during which he had time to reflect on what he was doing over and over again. Yet instead of ceasing his misconduct after one incident, he continued with impunity until he was caught. His was an extremely calculated effort, designed to avoid detection for as long as possible, ironically using the very skills (e.g. encryption, Tor, etc.) that he learned on the job and on the public’s dime.""

Reason #3: Force jeopardized the Silk Road investigation.

The third reason why prosecutors are not going easy on Force is that he greatly jeopardized the Silk Road investigation with his misconduct. Force was part of the Baltimore Silk Road Task Force, which was tasked to uncover the digital black market and arrest its operator Ross Ulbricht, AKA Dread Pirate Roberts. But by breaking all protocol, Force could have ruined a years-long project, spanning four government agencies (the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Postal Inspection Service, Homeland Security Investigations, and his own Drug Enforcement Agency).

Indeed, after the news of Force's arrest broke, Ulbricht's lawyer contended that his client was denied a fair trial. Which, by that time, had already ended, of course, with Ulbricht found guilty.

In Force's sentencing memorandum, the prosecutors write:

""Given Force’s role as the undercover agent on that case in communication with Ulbricht, it would have been obvious to Force as a longtime federal agent that he would be a key, if not the key, witness for the government in any future prosecution in Maryland. In stealing money, creating unauthorized personas and having encrypted ultra vires communications, Force acted with reckless disregard for the potential for his actions to jeopardize the very case he was tasked with building. Rather than working to take down the Silk Road – what he was being paid with taxpayer dollars to do – Force lined his own pockets.""

Reason #4: A lengthy sentence should serve as a warning to would-be corrupt agents.

The fourth and final reason prosecutors believe Force should be locked up for seven years is that such a sentence would send a signal to his colleagues – both at the DEA and at other government agencies – as well as the public.

The prosecutors contend that Force's prison sentence should act as a deterrence for would-be corrupt officials. The sentencing memorandum reads:

""The Court should send a message that this kind of conduct will be met with a harsh penalty in the form of a high-end prison sentence. A message of leniency communicates to other potentially corrupt government officials that the possibility of prison might be worth the risk in order to profit several hundred thousands or millions of dollars.""

And finally, the prosecution believes that a significant prison sentence should show the American public that the criminal justice system works. Not just against criminals among the population, but also against criminals within the government itself.

The prosecution argues:

""At the time of his criminal activity, the defendant’s legitimate work with the DEA was busting drug dealers, arresting them and charging them with drug crimes that carry significant custody time. In the midst of all of this he was stealing money and property from others. In his off-time, he was investing the proceeds of that criminal activity in a business that he worked for on the side, without approval, and striking movie deals and book deals with a Hollywood studio. It is critical that people understand and believe that when a law enforcement agent gets caught doing these kinds of things, he will be dealt with severely by the system of which he was once a part.""

2016/2/15,U.S. Marshals Will Hold the Final Auction of the Silk Road Bitcoin This Week,"Over the past year, the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS ) has auctioned off a large part of the bitcoin that had been confiscated as a result of the Silk Road investigation. The USMS will hold the final auction for 44,341 bitcoin seized as a result of the criminal conviction and civil forfeiture against Ross Ulbricht. At today’s market price, the bitcoin are worth about $15 million.

During the course of the investigation, the USMS seized more than 144,000 BTC from Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the Silk Road marketplace. At the moment of seizure, the bitcoin were worth about $122 million. In addition to these funds, the USMS also confiscated a total of 29,000 BTC from various Silk Road-related wallets.

Based on the latest statement released by the USMS, the auction will be carried out during a six-hour period, starting at 8 a.m. and ending at 2 p.m. Eastern on November 5. Once the auction is started, bids will be accepted by email from bidders who have pre-registered by completing all of the registration documents. The registration period runs from October 19 to today, November 2. 

To be considered valid applicants for this auction, interested bidders should complete the papers regardless of whether they participated in the last auction held by the USMS. Also, the auction is open only to U.S.citizens, so foreign investors won’t have a way of participating by themselves; the only viable way of getting some of the bitcoin is through a third party or syndicate.

The last auction was held in March, and was deemed a success, with a total of 14 bidders purchasing more than 50,000 BTC. However, it did spark some controversy, as a secretive bitcoin firm named Cumberland Mining managed to win the majority of the bitcoin.

Ulbricht, 31, was found guilty on all charges relating to his connection with the Silk Road market, which was the world’s most popular online drug store, functioning on the deep web. He was sentenced to life in prison on May 29.",Law & Justice,0.8777
2016/2/23,"ANX CEO Ken Lo: Hong Kong's New Budget Initiatives a ""Step in the Right Direction""","It’s a good time to be involved in digital assets in Hong Kong. In the territory’s 2016-17 budget, Financial Secretary John Tsang laid out a plan for the government to support blockchain technology development by encouraging its application in financial services, including reducing suspicious transactions and bringing down transaction costs.

The 2016-17 budget aims to support 150 fintech startups over the next five years in Hong Kong Island’s Cyberport, and arrange for 300 students to train in fintech overseas. It will also provide training for the financial services industry in blockchain matters and promote relevant technologies to develop products and services.

As Hong Kong’s government takes positive steps to foster blockchain technology and wider fintech incubation, Bitcoin Magazine spoke to ANX International’s CEO Ken Lo to get his perspective on the benefits to adopting blockchain technology and recent developments in Hong Kong.

ANX International is at the center of the innovation in Hong Kong’s digital assets ecosystem, offering a one-stop shop for blockchain development. As well as carrying out coin development, building white label trading platforms in primary and secondary markets, and integrating digital currencies into debit cards, ANX is pioneering the use of the blockchain in compliance.

While the regulators are proactively encouraging blockchain technology, do you feel that banks and financial services firms are sufficiently aware of the cost savings available from adopting this technology?

Blockchain is still very new and perceived as risky by many banks and financial services firms. In the past year, these institutions have done their research and are now aware of the benefits of blockchain technology.

This is really where ANX excels, as we have been helping companies realize and implement the benefits of blockchain technology for over two years now. We are the only one-stop shop for institutions and businesses to be able to get advisory, systems integration and managed services in blockchain technology today. We provide our software as a service (SaaS) platform globally, so businesses can get on board with blockchain technology in less than 10 days. We provide the digital assets, exchange platform and managed services so the businesses don't have to invest any capex [capital expenditures] to integrate our services.

Businesses integrating such services will benefit, but what are the practical benefits of wider adoption and integration of digital assets into exchanges for the industry as a whole?

Exchanges can help with the liquidity and integration of blockchain digital assets into traditional networks. The more points of presence the easier it is for the adoption and realization of benefits such as convenience for users.

Hong Kong’s government has recognised the importance of blockchain in financial services, including in reducing suspicious transactions and transaction costs. How could blockchain influence the way financial institutions comply with anti-money laundering (AML), know your customer (KYC) and other regulations?

Blockchain is an excellent platform that can support AML and KYC with its built-in encryption of transactions that is tamper-proof. Applications built on top of the blockchain can be assured of its integrity. With such a secure and transparent platform, all transactions can be traced and matched with identifiable origins.

The 2016-17 budget aims to step up blockchain innovation, fintech and startup incubation. Given Hong Kong’s historically low research and development spending, do you feel this goes far enough?

There is always room for improvement. Hong Kong is taking the steps in the right direction on what it needs to do in order to stay competitive and retain the financial capital status. John Tsang's initiatives mentioned in the 2016-17 budget speech will surely be a boost for Hong Kong.",Law & Justice,0.9977
2016/3/14,"Researchers Propose RSCoin, a Permissioned Blockchain Currency Controlled by Central Banks","In September Bitcoin Magazine reported that Andrew G. Haldane, chief economist at the Bank of England (BoE), hinted at the possibility that the U.K. government might issue a digital currency. 

“What I think is now reasonably clear is that the distributed payment technology embodied in Bitcoin has real potential,” said Haldane. “Bitcoin’s ‘blockchain’ technology appears to offer an imaginative solution to that distributed trust problem. That is why work on central bank-issued digital currencies forms a core part of the [BoE]’s current research agenda.”

Haldane left as open questions whether blockchain technology could support central bank-issued digital currency, and whether the public would accept it as a substitute for paper currency. 

Earlier this month, Ben Broadbent, BoE’s deputy governor, said that distributed ledger technology could make retail payments more efficient and the financial system as a whole more resilient. 

“The main point here is that the important innovation in bitcoin isn’t the alternative unit of account – it seems very unlikely that, to any significant extent, we’ll ever be paying for things in bitcoins, rather than pounds, dollars or euros – but its settlement technology, the so-called ‘distributed ledger,’” he said. 

Broadbent confirmed that the BoE is actively pursuing distributed ledger research, and added that a central bank digital currency would involve putting reserve deposits on a distributed ledger.

“The issue of digital currencies forms an important part of our One Bank Research Agenda,” concluded Broadbent. “In publishing the Agenda a year ago, we asked for help, hoping to encourage ‘the wider academic community’ to think about the big policy questions.” 

The One Bank Research Agenda paper noted that blockchain fintech could reshape the financial industry and called for further research to devise a system that could use distributed ledger technology without compromising a central bank’s ability to control its currency.

Now, British researchers have invented a Bitcoin-like system that could make digital cash more practical by allowing a central bank such as the Federal Reserve to control it, MIT Technology Review reports. 

University College London researchers George Danezis and Sarah Meiklejohn presented a paper titled “Centrally Banked Cryptocurrencies” at the Network & Distributed System Security Symposium in San Diego last month. The paper, which acknowledges contributions from the BoE, introduces RSCoin, “a cryptocurrency framework that decouples the generation of the monetary supply from the maintenance of the transaction ledger.”

“Our design decisions were largely motivated by the desire to create a more scalable cryptocurrency, but were also inspired by the research agenda of the Bank of England, and the question of ‘whether central banks should themselves make use of such technology to issue digital currencies,’” note the researchers. “Indeed, as Bitcoin becomes increasingly widespread, we expect that this will be a question of interest to many central banks around the world.”

RSCoin would be a closed, “permissioned” blockchain offering the advantages of digital currencies – fast and cheap transactions permanently recorded in a shared distributed ledger – without the troublesome openness of the Bitcoin network where anyone can be an anonymous node on the network. Instead of anonymous miners, only the central bank and vetted financial operators would be allowed to validate RSCoin transactions. 

Permissioned blockchains are supported by, among others, Accenture and Digital Asset Holdings CEO Blythe Masters, but others, including legendary cryptographer Nick Szabo, strongly argue that financial operators should, instead, embrace the crowd-sourced power and resiliency of permissionless blockchains like Bitcoin.

RSCoin would be controlled by the central bank, which would also retain a special encryption key that could be used to control the money supply – as it happens, for example, in Quantitative Easing (QE) programs.

As reported by MIT Technology Review, Meiklejohn says it would make sense for large commercial banks to process and validate transactions in the RSCoin network. Meiklejohn added that RSCoin’s centralized design would permit a high transaction throughput, unlike Bitcoin. In fact, a recent study shows that, in the current design of Bitcoin Core, there is a fundamental conflict between throughput and decentralization. Incremental improvements could permit a throughput of about 27 transactions per second in the Bitcoin network, but “more aggressive scaling will, in the longer term, require fundamental protocol redesign.”

“[RSCoin] provides the control over monetary policy that entities such as central banks expect to retain,” conclude Danezis and Meiklejohn. “By constructing a blockchain-based approach that makes relatively minimal alterations to the design of successful cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, we have demonstrated that this centralization can be achieved while still maintaining the transparency guarantees that have made (fully) decentralized cryptocurrencies so attractive.”

RSCoin currently is only a research proposal, but it’s interesting to speculate on whether it could become an official project of the BoE, as previous – veiled but clear – statements by the central bank seems to indicate.",Law & Justice,0.9982
2016/3/28,The Bank of England’s RSCoin: An Experiment for Central Banks or a Bitcoin Alternative?,"On February 21, 2016, the Bank of England reported that it had partnered with researchers at  University College in London to produce RSCoin, a digital currency designed for central bankers. 

Sarah Meiklejohn and George Danezis, two students from University College, created RSCoin which, they announced, offered a protocol superior to that of Bitcoin. The researchers said their work was a response to Bitcoin’s limited transaction throughput, which is capped at around  seven transactions per second today based on the 1 megabyte block size limit and current network conditions. In comparison, credit card payments networks like Visa are able to process around 7,000 transactions per second.

Bitcoin Magazine talked to Andreas M. Antonopoulos, author of Mastering Bitcoin, about RSCoin and centralized digital currencies.

Digital Currency Not a Winner-Takes-All Domain

Although developers are currently debating the best way to increase Bitcoin scalability, other researchers have tried to tackle the problem by plotting alternate or additional decentralized systems that would lighten the load. However, none of these systems has been properly tested to date and all fail to produce high transaction volumes says Gün Sirer, hacker and professor at Cornell University.

Meiklejohn and Danezis argue that RSCoin is the first type of digital currency that pivots around a central network. 

They noted that their system was more scalable in that it “can process over 2,000 transactions per second” and that  “most transactions take less than one second to clear, as compared to many minutes in traditional cryptocurrency designs.”  Meanwhile, Ben Broadbent, the Bank of England's deputy governor, told the London School of Economics that a centralized digital currency could strengthen the financial system.

Antonopoulos disagrees:

“I find it to be a hyperbolic claim that RSCoin will replace or void Bitcoin. First of all, the new currency domain is not a winner-takes-all domain and has no monopoly status like national currencies do. Secondly, Bitcoin's design is intended to solve problems that are entirely different from the problems RScoin is designed to solve. The two systems fit in completely separate niches and serve completely different audiences.”

He continued: 

“I see no reason why a Bitcoin user would be interested in RScoin or vice-versa. Bitcoin offers censorship resistance, open access, borderless commerce, permissionless innovation, network neutrality and strong immutability. RScoin has none of those features, replacing the network-centric trustless and decentralized model with a centralized authority. Anyone who wants centralized authority has no interest in Bitcoin.” 

Will RSCoin Help the Banks?

Banks have long disagreed over whether Bitcoin will help them. Taking the Bank of England as an instance, Broadbent told The Guardian that a digital-style currency would be bad for loans and may even threaten financial stability in the U.K. But a centralized RSCoin, Broadbent believes, could benefit retail payments and stabilize the financial system. 

Says Antonopoulos:

“Bitcoin's disruption to banking comes from the fact that it removes intermediaries and barriers to entry, reducing the cost of participation and providing neutrality of transport of value. RSCoin may be more palatable to banks, but it does nothing to dampen the disruption caused by a completely different approach to global finance as offered by Bitcoin.” 

In other words, banks may prefer RSCoin precisely because banks can have control over the digital currency â€’ but initial problems remain.

Antonopoulos elaborated: “RSCoin is business as usual, dressed up as innovation, by emulating the least interesting features of Bitcoin. When the Internet came out, phone companies initially countered by introducing video-telephony and full-color faxing. RSCoin is the full-color-fax equivalent to Bitcoin's Internet of Money.”",Law & Justice,-0.271

         Bank of England Official Discusses Implications of Central Bank Digital Currencies
        
Deputy Governor of the Bank of England Ben Broadbent has spoken out on the implications of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) for the financial system as we know it.

In Broadbent’s lecture at the London School of Economics on March 2, he focused on what a central bank digital currency could look like, and potential economic implications of introducing one.

Central Bank Digital Currency

A CBDC could be issued by a central bank to widen access to the central bank’s balance sheet. Liabilities on the central bank’s balance sheet include banknotes and commercial bank reserves, and are the means of settlement for all of the economy’s transactions. Currently, only banks can hold deposits at the Bank of England. A CBDC could open up access to these liabilities to specific groups of financial services firms, or even to individuals.

A CBDC could also allow a central bank to set a negative interest rate on cash, rather than only deposits. The Bank of England’s Chief Economist signalled in 2015 that the U.K. government was considering this possibility.

Broadbent recognizes that there could be significant economic implications if a CBDC competed with commercial banks by permitting individuals to make deposits. In a fractional-reserve banking system, commercial banks accept deposits and loan money using these deposits as collateral. This can be to other banks, businesses, individuals and organizations. This leads to a cycle of lending and increases the money supply in the entire economy.

While the central bank’s balance sheet consists of liquid assets, commercial banks’ balance sheets are mostly illiquid assets in the form of loans. Broadbent described commercial bank balance sheets as “inherently fragile” due to their being backed by very different assets of mostly illiquid loans. As the government guarantees deposits at the Bank of England, a flight to safety may take place and drain commercial banks of resources.

Given the Bank of England’s responsibility to promote financial stability, opening up access to central bank deposits may seem counterintuitive. However, Broadbent says this could encourage commercial banks to “narrow” and shift to structures with assets as liquid as their liabilities. In this scenario, “deposits would become inherently more secure.”

However, a shift to this structure could reduce lending by banks to the real economy. Many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are unable to issue their own securities, so lines of credit from banks are vital support. In the U.K., the British Bankers’ Association recorded £107.5 billion ($152 billion) in SME borrowing facilities at the end of 2015, including £26.6 billion ($37.7 billion) in new loans provided by banks to SMEs in 2015.

Blockchain as a Clearinghouse

“The main point here is that the important innovation in Bitcoin isn’t the alternative unit of account … but its settlement technology, the so-called “distributed ledger.”  This allows transfers to be verifiably recorded without the need for a trusted third party.  It is potentially valuable when there is no such institution and when verifying such information on a multilateral basis is costly,” said Ben Broadbent, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England

Broadbent identified the distributed ledger as the most important innovation in digital currencies, describing it as a “decentralized virtual clearinghouse and asset register” that “offers an entirely new way of exchanging and holding assets, including money.”

He recognises the potential for distributed ledgers to replace the existing complex system of custodians of securities, brokers, exchanges and clearinghouses, each of which is obliged to keep its own records. There is much potential for systemic efficiency savings; clearance and settlement of securities has been estimated by Autonomous Research to cost G7 economies $54 billion annually.

What’s Next?

The Bank will continue examining potential use of digital currencies as a part of its “One Bank Research Agenda.” This also encourages the wider community to consider policy questions, monetary and financial stability perspectives on CBDCs, implications for government-backed deposit insurance and regulation of institutions offering access to CBDCs.

Potential use of blockchain technology will also be investigated in the Bank’s review of its Real Time Gross Settlement system, which transfers balances between participants’ accounts at the Bank.

At this stage, the Bank is raising more questions than it answers. It is not the only one carrying out such research; the People’s Bank of China has announced that it is also discussing the possibility. There is clearly significant potential for CBDCs from a policy perspective, but structural implications must be considered.",Law & Justice,0.9927
2016/4/12,U.S. State Department Recommends Development of Blockchain and Distributed Ledgers to International Partners,"Last month the U.S. State Department launched the ""American Innovation Roadshow"" with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Senior members of U.S. Secretary of State’s John Kerry's economic team led business delegations from financial investors, U.S. multinational and early stage companies.  In two stunning speeches, the State Department began advocating the adoption blockchain technology.

Ambassador David H. Thorne, senior adviser to the secretary of state, was among those attending the roadshow.  The ambassador leads a departmentwide effort to “position economic and commercial issues more prominently within the U.S. foreign policy landscape” and to “elevate the importance of entrepreneurship, technology and innovation in the State Department’s promotion of global prosperity.”

Thorne gave speeches at both the March 3 @America Innovation at Innovation and Entrepreneurship Presentations at Pacific Place in Jakarta, Indonesia and the March 7 Vietnam Ministry of Science and Technology Innovation Conference in Hanoi. 

Speeches given by the ambassador encouraged these countries to adopt blockchain and distributed ledger technologies.

Both the Vietnam and Indonesia (prepared) remarks included the following similar, if not identical, recommendations:

“…[W]e would like to encourage the development of new financial technology or 'FinTech' innovations – blockchain and distributed ledgers, mobile banking, etc – which will provide a backbone to the e-commerce activity … These kinds of tools naturally encourage fiscal and business transparency, not just for start-ups but for everyone, which is a key for reducing corruption and improving efficiency.”

Bitcoin Blockchain Advances

Last year the White House named Dr. Ed Felten deputy U.S. chief technology officer. Felten was previously the director of the Center for Information Technology Policy (CITP) at Princeton University, and is a well regarded Bitcoin researcher.

Felten previously stated in CITP’s “Freedom to Tinker” blog that Bitcoin is “a new kind of thing: a currency whose rules are determined by open-source governance…  [and that] governments will find new ways to influence it.”

Since Felten’s appointment, the Bitcoin community has been closely watching the Obama administration’s Bitcoin or “Blockchain Policy”  -- or lack of thereof.  Back in 2014, the White House was asked at a daily briefing if it was monitoring Bitcoin and had a position on it. 

Jay Carney, then White House press secretary, said only, “For administration’s position on it, I would refer you to the Treasury Department.”

In January 2015, the State Department sought a virtual fellow to serve with the Office of Monetary Affairs, Office of International Finance and Development and Bureau of Economics and Business Affairs as digital currency research consultant. According to the posting, “The State Department's Office of Monetary Affairs (OMA) is responsible for monitoring developments in global currencies, including digital currencies such as Bitcoin.”

In January of this year, Bitcoin Vietnam and Coinify announced that they launched the first “blockchain payment processing platform” for Vietnam. In March the Vietnam Ministry of Industry of Trade issued caution against the use of Bitcoin and other altcoins (as reported by The Merkle).     

In May 2015, The Wall Street Journal reported that Indonesians began embracing Bitcoin. Tribunnews.com of Jakarta reports that Bitcoin is quite popular in major cities across Indonesia even as the Bank of Indonesia continues to urge caution.

The American Innovation Roadshow dialog is the clearest signal yet that the Obama administration is not only looking at blockchain technologies favorably, but also proactively advocating its adoption.",Law & Justice,0.2263
2016/4/26,Estonia Financial Agency Stops Two Year Long Investigation of Bitcoin Trader,"The Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit on Friday stopped its investigation of a Bitcoin trader in the Northern Baltic European nation. The decision comes after  Otto de Voogd had evidently exercised his right to remain silent over the course of two years. 

In February 2014, de Voogd’s BTC.ee announced it “temporarily stopped trading due to threats issued by Estonian police.” The Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit and Border Guard Board emailed de Voogd, demanding details about the company’s registration, anti-money laundering procedures and other due diligence processes ‒ proof that he was operating in accordance with the law.

If he failed to comply, de Voogd faced three years in prison and a maximum fine of  32,000 euros. But authorities never brought formal charges against de Voogd, who calls himself a “Bitcoin hobbyist.” 

De Voogd crowdsourced a small part of his legal battle. (He keeps an overview of expenses and donations here.) 

He told Bitcoin Magazine he worried that if he provided the information requested by the authorities it could be used against him in court. Estonia previously charged another person for trading 2,000 euros worth of bitcoins. De Voogd, who has had approximately 9,000 euros in lawyers fees and 1,000 euros in donations, indicates his trades totaled a modestly higher amount.

He admits to profiting from the sale of bitcoins ‒ to the tune of about 270 euros. Many traders in the space make approximately one percent profit. A Bitcoiner from the Netherlands, de Voogd claims Estonia acted in violation of European Law by extending anti-money laundering laws to Bitcoin without justifying and registering the changes with the European Commission. 

Throughout his trial, de Voogd claimed a “systematic attempt by Estonia to thwart Bitcoin.” He cites an imposed VAT on the total value of Bitcoin, which differs from other European nations which impose VAT mostly on margin or profit. 

“Every step of the way Estonia did the utmost,” de Voogd says,“to hinder and hamper Bitcoin use, and by extension all other blockchain-based tokens and assets.”

In an April decision regarding de Voogd’s case, Estonia’s Supreme Court ruled that Bitcoin trading is subject to anti-money laundering regulation and state supervision.

The Estonian Supreme Court determined Bitcoin trading would be regulated by the nation’s anti-money laundering legislation.

“Estonia is trying to heavily restrict the use of Bitcoin,” de Voogd said. “Including the requirement to meet customers in person, as well as the requirement keep IDs of all customers and report those who trade more than 1,000 euros more per month.” Estonia is the only European Union nation to apply such strict requirements to Bitcoin. 

When BTC.ee was shut down by law enforcement agencies in 2014, de Voogd demanded clarification of the nation’s laws. BTC.ee’s volume of all the trades over the course of one year was below the normal European Union anti-money laundering reporting threshold for a single transaction, de Voogd told Bitcoin Magazine. Most transactions were under 100 euros worth, he says. 

“The whole purpose of my activity was to help people get started by trying some Bitcoin, so people coming in to ask questions and buy a small amount was great,” de Voogd said. “But it was not a profitable activity, not even worth the time I spent on it. If you add that **** that Estonia created over my trading, it was certainly not worth it.”

Bitcoin aside, Estonia appears to be a leader in digital innovation. Bitcoin Magazine  has covered the nation’s E-Residency program. But, in discussions about Bitcoin regulation, Estonia takes a hardline approach. For instance, it was the only country in favor of VAT on Bitcoin in the European Court of Justice. Germany and Sweden argued in favor of a VAT on only the service fee. Estonia did not get its way. The court ruled Bitcoin exempt from VAT. 

De Voogd doesn’t live in Estonia anymore. He plans to lodge a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights regarding “the violation of my privilege against self-incrimination, among other things.” He no longer considers Estonia a Western nation. 

“One should act with the same caution one would in Russia, and make sure you have explicit permission to do something before you do anything,” he warns. “Permissionless innovation is not part of their system, you must wait until something is explicitly authorized.”",Law & Justice,-0.1531
2016/5/12,Swiss City to Pilot Bitcoin Payments for Public Services,"In an international first, the Swiss town of Zug in central Switzerland will begin accepting Bitcoin payments for government services on a trial basis, the international service of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation SwissInfo reports.

Zug residents will be able to make payments of up to 200 Swiss francs ($205) using Bitcoin.

Mayor Dolfi Mueller said that the Zug City Council wants to show its ""openness to new technologies"" and cater to local financial technology companies, BBC News reports. The Zug area is known as the ""crypto-valley,"" as it hosts more than a dozen companies specializing in Bitcoin-related activities. 

The pilot project, officially approved on May 3, will start on July 1 and continue until the end of 2016. After an analysis of the results, the city will decide whether it wants to continue accepting Bitcoin payments in the future. 

“This is the first time worldwide that bitcoins have been accepted as a currency on a state level,” said Niklas Nikolajsen, co-founder and CEO of Bitcoin Suisse, a Bitcoin exchange based in Baar, not far from Zug. 

Engadget notes that the project is an ideal testbed. Zug has a laissez-faire approach to its economy, even for the relatively market-libertarian climate of Switzerland. And it’s an important financial center ‒ 3 percent of the world's oil trades through the area ‒ with an innovative fintech sector. 

Fortune notes that the Zug initiative could be motivated by the low transaction costs offered by Bitcoin. In fact, the city is looking for ways to cut costs to compensate for the lack of income from taxes, which are very low.

In recent years entrepreneurs and programmers have made Zug’s crypto-valley a leader in fintech and digital-currencies, according to the Greater Zurich area website. New trading markets, new encryption technologies or new digital currencies are being developed, with room for a wide spectrum of possibilities, including Bitcoin. 

Among the blockchain-based fintech companies active in the area, Monetas wants to develop a decentralized, global system for financial and legal transactions – lightning-fast, with very low transaction fees and without intermediaries. The Ethereum Foundation is also based in the area.

“When digital financial services first came about, we had to build a global center where you could find a safe and supportive environment for emerging technologies,” said Monetas CEO Johann Gevers, referring to the vision to establish a crypto-valley in Zug. 

Switzerland has a long tradition of privacy, stable direct-democratic politics and top class computer expertise, including cryptography and security. The tax environment is extremely advantageous, and the regulatory environment is also favorable because digital currencies are treated as foreign currencies in Switzerland, which means that it’s not necessary to create new laws and regulations, and digital currency trading is exempt from VAT. These are among the reasons Xapo, a provider of secure Bitcoin wallet and vault storage, decided to relocate its corporate headquarters to the Zurich area in 2015.

Not everyone is persuaded that the initiative is a good idea. Representatives of the conservative-nationalist SVP party wrote to the city council inquiring about the legal basis for the council deciding which currencies it could accept. 

""It is highly concerning that a state institution should accept Bitcoin, since it is not a secure currency,"" city council member Gregor Bruhin told Neue Zuercher Zeitung. ""The city of Zug could undermine the status of cash with its actions."" 

Mueller is much more optimistic: ""I can imagine that in the near future it will be possible to pay your tax bill with Bitcoin,"" he told the paper.

The Zug initiative is interesting because it’s an official project of a city that, despite being small, managed to become an important financial center in the heart of Europe, and could be imitated by other cities ‒ and even nations ‒ in Europe and worldwide. A lot depends on the result of the pilot project, to be evaluated after the end of the year, and it seems likely that adoption by citizens will be the most important factor in deciding whether and how to continue and expand the project.",Law & Justice,0.9949
2016/6/9,Bitcoin and the Blockchain Take the Stage for International Summit of Central Banks at the Federal Reserve,"When Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin white paper in 2008, little did Bitcoin’s creator know that less than 10 years later, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen would be encouraging central banks around the world to take a closer look at the benefits of Bitcoin and blockchain technology to improve the world’s financial systems.

In her remarks to the International Conference on Policy Challenges for the Financial Sector, the chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve acknowledged heightened concerns about cybersecurity, and said banks must move forward into the digital age and learn how to apply Bitcoin, blockchain and distributed ledger technologies.

At a low-key three-day conference in Washington, D.C., last week organized by the Federal Reserve, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, more than 90 central banks from around the world heard from members of the Bitcoin community, including Perianne Boring, founder and president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, Bloq CEO Jeff Garzik and Chain CEO Adam Ludwin.

Conference participants were told that their discussions would be off the record – no recordings or videos would be allowed. As a result, the normally conservative crowd may have been freer to explore the possibilities of a whole new way of looking at money and finances.

Bitcoin Luminaries Shine Light on New Technologies for Conference Participants

In a keynote address, Ludwin told central bankers they will issue national currencies in digital form in the near future. He cited many reasons for this shift, including:

1. Banking and finance are next up to digitalize and globalize, just as music, publishing and communications sectors have grown and benefitted from new technologies. He noted that soon, the phrase “cross-border payment” will make about as much sense as “cross-border email.”

2. Bitcoin is into its seventh year and is still showing robust resilience and steady growth as the volume of transactions, increasing steadily, is now at 250,000 a day.

3. Multisig and other technologies provide more robust security than traditional banknotes and systems, and more flexibility than current centralized systems.

4. The efficiencies and cost savings of these new technologies will be the strongest reason to digitalize. (At this point in the presentation Ludwin brought out his phone and sent a Bitcoin donation to Wikipedia in one easy step – likely the first Bitcoin donation sent from the Federal Reserve.)

5. Other financial institutions are already building new networks to digitalize assets such as securities and currencies, so they can move more efficiently and securely.

6. Central banks will want to be in a better position to influence liquidity in the increasingly important capital markets that operate outside of depository institutions.

Ludwin went on to note that ultimately, blockchain networks will lead to a safer and better payments system. And central bank digital currency will be the foundation of that system.

Bloq’s Garzik stressed that the greatest advantages of digital currencies will be seen first in the developing world. “Some of the greatest potential benefits of blockchain technology are going to be first seen and actively leveraged in emerging nations,” he said.

Garzik told the conference that the innovative elements of blockchain technology, including trust shifting, decentralization, cryptography and immutability will guarantee its future success in the banking and financial sectors.

Boring, of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, encouraged the Federal Reserve and central banks to focus on and embrace innovation in blockchain and distributed ledger technology. 

“We believe blockchain technologies are capable of providing the Fed and other regulators with next-generation tools to fulfill their mission of monitoring the safety and soundness of the financial system more effectively,” Boring told American Banker.

Central Banks Already Have Begun the Process of Exploring Blockchain Technology

As has been previously covered by Bitcoin Magazine, the Federal Reserve and the People’s Bank of China have both been active in studying the emergence of digital currencies .On February 3, David Andolfatto, Vice President of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, wrote a blog post based on a presentation he gave at the International Workshop on P2P Financial Systems 2015. The title of the blog post is “Fedcoin: On the Desirability of a Government Cryptocurrency.”

Perhaps the most surprising thing is that an inherently conservative financial sector ‒ particularly central banks ‒ have responded so positively to blockchain technology in such a historically short period of time.

Other speakers at the three-day conference included:

Fredrik Voss, Vice President of Blockchain Innovation, NASDAQ
Tom Jessop, Managing Director of Technology Business Development, Goldman Sachs
Alan McIntyre, Senior Managing Director of Global Banking, Accenture
Hollis Hart, President, Citi International Franchise Management
Carolyn Wilkins, Senior Deputy Governor, Bank of Canada

2016/6/17,The Ethereum Community Debates Soft Fork to Blacklist Funds in Wake of $50M DAO Heist,"The DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization built on the Ethereum blockchain, has been the subject of a continued hack today that has seen the theft of over 3.5 million Ether, which was valued at more than $50 million at the time of the heist.

The DAO was created as a utopian decentralized venture capital-style smart contract, enabling individuals to gain voting shares in exchange for the virtual currency Ether. Naturally, the fund has attracted huge attention in the digital currency world, with more individuals jumping on board, raising more than $150 million worth of Ether during its crowdsale.

Early Friday morning, however, the DAO was hit by as yet unidentified attackers appearing to take advantage of a recursive calling vulnerability, draining millions of Ether into a Child DAO where the hacker(s) will gain control of the funds when it opens after 27 days unless the Ethereum community adopts a proposed soft fork which would prevent the funds from moving. Since the discovery of the hack, the value of Ethereum has dropped dramatically from trading at $21.50 to $13.35 at its lowest. Only a few days ago, Ethereum was soaring, nearing $20 for the first time.

One Ether wallet identified by members of the community as a recipient of the apparent stolen funds currently holds more than 3.5 million Ether. At a current exchange of around $14/ETH that brings the total to $47 million; however, at the pre-theft valuation of $21.50/ETH, the amount is significantly more: $79 million.

Griff Green, a spokesperson for Slock.it, said that there is a conversation with the miners to create a soft fork, which would block the Child DAO and the DAO from making any further transactions of any kind.

“After the immediate soft fork, there are discussions about preparing for a hard fork that will, on a certain block in the future create a smart contract that all the ETH in the DAO and the Child DAO will be sent to,” Griff said on the DAO Slack channel. “This smart contract will allow the holder of any DAO tokens to claim their fair share of ETH.”

Former Ethereum CCO and Slock.it founder, Stephan Tual, said on the DAO slack channel:

“In summary, a hard fork will retrieve all stolen funds from the attacker. If you have purchased DAO tokens, you will be transferred to a smart contract where you can only retrieve funds. Since no money in the DAO was ever spent, nothing was lost.”

Commenting about the hack, Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center, said:

""DAOs are an important experiment in community governance—governance by code rather than law or norms. Experiments come with risks and rewards and we only learn from the process by letting them run, succeed or fail.""

""It looks like The DAO is failing, but there are some bright spots and the community is already learning critical lessons.""

""For one thing, it's good to see that delays were built into the code so that even though funds are being ""stolen,"" they are stuck in limbo for at least 27 days because of the code that governs the system. That will give the community of users, miners, and developers time to decide what to do. It could mean that we accept the loss, or that changes are made to Ethereum's protocol to return the funds. But those decisions will be made by a decentralized community that votes.""

""This is a laboratory for community governance, and it won't always be pretty. But it's important we let the process play out, and take a longer view of the evolution of these fantastic new tools.""

 

The Known Exploit

Interestingly, five days ago, the DAO posted a blog reportedly stating that the exploit used by the hacker had been fixed. In the post, Tual said that the problem had been taken care of:

“We issued a fix immediately as part of the DAO Framework 1.1 milestone. The important takeaway from this is: as there is no ether whatsoever in the DAO’s rewards account – this is NOT an issue that is putting any DAO funds at risk today.”

It seems, however, as though the issue to fix the DAO Github did not match up with the recommendations in this blog post, choosing the non-recommended approach to deal with the issue.

Unlike other high profile hacks that were reversed in a hard fork, it seems as though the Ethereum community and the DAO holders have a bit of time to consider their options and will need to make a big decision in the next few days.

Should a hard fork be put into place that will prevent the hacker from gaining around over $50 million, which would be the equivalent of a major heist on a financial institution, or should the DAO and potentially Ethereum simply crash and burn?",Law & Justice,0.9803
2016/6/21,"Bank of England Launches Fintech Accelerator, Partners With PwC on Distributed Ledger Project","In a speech prepared for the Lord Mayor’s Banquet for Bankers and Merchants of the City of London at the Mansion House, Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England (BoE), revealed that the BoE is launching a fintech accelerator.

“I am announcing tonight that the Bank is launching a fintech accelerator to work in partnership with fintech firms on challenges that we, as a central bank, uniquely face,” Carney says in his prepared remarks. “The accelerator will work with new technology firms to help us harness fintech innovations for central banking. In return, it will offer firms the chance to demonstrate their solutions for real issues facing us as policymakers, together with the valuable ‘first client’ reference that comes with it. With time, the accelerator will build a network of firms working in this space for the benefit of us and them alike.”

Distributed ledger technology is an important aspect of emerging fintech. “[If] distributed ledger technology could provide a more efficient way for private sector firms to deliver payments and settle securities, why not apply it to the core of the payments system itself?” Carney says. “The great promise of distributed ledgers for central banks is their potential to enhance resilience. Distributing the ledger means multiple copies of the system. It can continue to operate if parts get knocked out. That removes the single point of failure risk inherent in a centralized system.”

However, the BoE is not prepared to risk the stability of the financial system by introducing still unproven emerging technologies too early in the payment system. Rather, the BoE intends to thoroughly study the opportunities offered by distributed ledger technologies (DL) as well as the challenges that need to be met before it could be used in central banking. “To help distinguish DL’s potential from its hype, the Bank has set up our own as a proof of concept,” said Carney.

“The distributed ledger is a genuine technological innovation that demonstrates that digital records can be held securely without any central authority,” reads the conclusion of a BoE a research paper titled “Innovations in Payment Technologies and the Emergence of Digital Currencies,” published in 2014. The “One Bank Research Agenda” discussion paper, issued by the BoE in February 2015, noted that blockchain fintech could reshape the financial industry and called for further research to devise a system that could use distributed ledger technology without compromising a central bank’s ability to control its currency. In September, Bitcoin Magazine reported that Andrew G. Haldane, chief economist at the Bank of England (BoE), hinted at the possibility that the U.K. government might issue a digital currency. 

The announcement of the BoE’s fintech accelerator can be seen as one more step toward mainstreaming distributed ledger technology and planning for its introduction in the overall economy. The BoE notes that it is the first central bank to establish a dedicated fintech initiative that works directly with fintech firms on a potentially wide range of topics.

In particular, the accelerator will appoint fintech firms to run short proof of concept (POC) projects in a number of priority areas. Each POC will have clearly defined requirements and success indicators.

“The selection process will be competitive and transparent,” states the BoE. “We will make clear our priorities, so that relevant firms can register their interest. The selected firms will have the opportunity to test and demonstrate their products in a live environment, working closely with Bank experts.”

PwC is one of the first firms to partner with the BoE’s fintech accelerator. The company announced that a team of PwC engineers and specialists in testing worked with the BoE to design and carry out a proof of concept built to explore the potential opportunities and challenges of using distributed ledger technology (DLT) for payments settlement.

“This proof of concept brought to life the core features of distributed ledgers, greatly enhancing the bank’s understanding of DLT,” said BoE’s Chief Information Officer Rob Elsey. “With PwC’s support, the bank’s developers used the latest techniques and software to deliver this POC and have gained further skills that will enable additional rapid proof of concepts in the future.”

“This is a significant piece of work and PwC are very excited to have been able to support the bank in developing their first DLT proof of concept, which will enable the Bank to gain a better awareness of DL from both a technology and policy perspective,” added Nick Bouch, financial services data leader and partner at PwC.",Law & Justice,0.9967
2016/6/21,A Legal Analysis of the DAO Exploit and Possible Investor Rights,"News broke early Friday morning that the DAO had been exploited using a code error (first described by Peter Vessenes) in the DAO software that caused the exploiter of the DAO (“Exploiter”) to be paid extra amounts of Ether (“ETH”) held by the DAO when executing a split proposal which created a new child DAO containing the extra ETH taken from the DAO and placed that child DAO within the Exploiter’s control.

Unlike mass consumer software, which is typically rigorously tested before release, the DAO was released more or less in alpha or beta condition. This means that it had likely not been robustly tested and was likely to encounter error states or behavioral outputs not yet observed. Although I cannot speak specifically to Slock.it’s quality control efforts, even large software development companies release buggy code. However, the law strongly regulates financial services software to prevent software laden with exploits that an affect consumer funds. The Exploiter took advantage of a bug that was widely discussed by such crypto-luminaries as Nick Szabo (Ethereum/Bitcoin), Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn (Zcash), Emin Gün Sirer (Professor at Cornell University) and Diego Gutiérrez Zaldívar (CEO of RSK-Labs, Rootstock), among others prior to the exploit occurring. From this context, the exploit should have been considered inevitable, especially given the attractiveness of the DAO and its ETH holdings worth over $205 million USD at the time of the attack, as a target.  Of course, the relative rights and powers of parties to remedy this exploit is complicated to diagnose because of the unique structure of the DAO and because the Exploiter may have actually complied with all terms and conditions of the DAO’s use and, thus, may not be doing anything more than executing commands on the system resulting in an unexpected and/or undesired outcome. 

In that context, we’ll take a look at the potential rights of Investors (i.e. DAO Token holders), the Exploiter his/herself/themselves, and of the Ethereum Foundation with respect to the exploit.  

NOTHING IN THIS ANALYSIS IS LEGAL ADVICE. IF YOU NEED LEGAL ADVICE, SEEK OUT A QUALIFIED ATTORNEY.

1. Analysis Is Difficult Because Unlike A Conventional Contract, The Terms Are Unclear.

It is unclear where an investor in the DAO can go to find the contract terms that bind them, and it is unclear, once they are found, as to whether there is any contract at all. There are terms, rules, regulations, terms, recitals, and warnings about the DAO, found at (1) Daohub.org, (2) the Slock.it GitHub (and its readme.md file), and (3) in the executable code itself (i.e. .sol files) as implemented. Slock.it’s GitHub, its readme.md file and its .sol files were ostensibly authored by Slock.it and whoever applied the latest commit to those files; until recently, it was unclear who was operating Daohub.org. Let’s look at some of the most germane provisions found at these sources: 

Daohub.org (all excerpts below captured from https://daohub.org/explainer.html) 

Explanation of Terms and Disclaimer
The terms of The DAO Creation are set forth in the smart contract code existing on the Ethereum blockchain at 0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413. Nothing in this explanation of terms or in any other document or communication may modify or add any additional obligations or guarantees beyond those set forth in The DAO’s code. Any and all explanatory terms or descriptions are merely offered for educational purposes and do not supercede or modify the express terms of The DAO’s code set forth on the blockchain; to the extent you believe there to be any conflict or discrepancy between the descriptions offered here and the functionality of The DAO’s code at 0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413, The DAO’s code controls and sets forth all terms of The DAO Creation.

Daohub.org’s statements all appear geared toward investors and suggest that its terms (as related to the creation of DAO Tokens) are secondary to that of the code, and references code at a specific Ethereum wallet as prevailing in the event of conflict between the two. This language also suggests that the terms related to the function of the DAO beyond the creation of DAO Tokens are all found at the designated Ethereum wallet. Thus, although the statements found on Daohub.org are written in plain English, there is no guarantee that the code found at the Ethereum wallet address noted, when actually executed, will comply with those disclosures. If there is a contradiction, the code wins.

The DAO’s smart contract code governs the Creation of DAO tokens and supercede any public statements about The DAO’s Creation made by third parties or individuals associated with The DAO, past, present and future. The software code currently available at https://github.com/slockit/dao is the sole source for the terms under which DAO tokens may be created.

Daohub.org’s statement also suggests that the terms are also held at the GitHub address noted therein which is the address for Slock.it’s repository. This conflicts from the statement above that suggests that the code terms (as related to the creation of DAO Tokens) are found at the specific Ethereum wallet address, unless they are identical to the terms found on Daohub.org. 

By Creating DAO tokens through interaction with The DAO’s smart contract code, you expressly agree to all of the terms and conditions set forth in that code. If you do not understand or do not agree to those terms, you should not Create DAO tokens.

The use of The DAO’s smart contract code and the Creation of DAO tokens carries significant financial risk, including using experimental software. This document does not constitute a Prospectus of any sort, is not a solicitation for investment and does not pertain in any way to an offering of securities in any jurisdiction.

Here, DaoHub.org suggests that using the code is risky, and if you do not understand the Code you should not use it, and that the DAO does not “pertain in any way to an offering of securities in any jurisdiction.”  

Risks
The Creation of DAO tokens carries with it significant risk. Prior to Creating DAO tokens, carefully consider the exemplary and non-exhaustive list of risks set forth below and, to the extent necessary, consult a lawyer, accountant, and/or tax professionals prior to Creating DAO tokens.

1. Risk of Security Weaknesses in The DAO’s Software

The DAO concept is both experimental in nature and unproven. There is a risk that, as an open source project, any contributor to The DAO’s software could introduce weaknesses or bugs into the DAO software, causing the loss of DAO tokens or ETH in one or more or even all of the DAO Token Holder’s accounts.

2. Risk of Weakness in the DAO underlying blockchain, and/or Ethereum Network

The DAO software is itself based on an unproven platform: the Ethereum blockchain. There is a risk that, as an open source project, any contributor to the Ethereum blockchain could introduce weaknesses or bugs into the Ethereum software, causing the loss of DAO tokens or ETH in one or more or even all of the DAO Token Holder’s accounts.

3. Risk of unforeseen attack vectors

The field of Digital Cryptography is very new and for this reason, there is a risk of unforeseen attack both in terms of the underlying cryptographic protocol that back the functioning of the DAO as well as 'game theory' related vectors which have not been documented to date. Both these vectors represent a risk that could lead the loss of DAO tokens or ETH in one or more or even all of the DAO Token Holder’s accounts.

Here, Daohub.org advises investors that there are risks of bugs or weaknesses in the platform due to coding updates by Slock.it or by Ethereum, or others attacking the system’s behavior.

The “Limitations Waiver of Liability” suggests that users of the DAO will not hold “third parties or individuals” associated with the “Dao creation” liable for injury “caused by or related to the use of, or inability to use, Dao Tokens or the Dao Platform,” disclaims responsibility for “the conduct of third parties, including other creators of DAO Tokens,” and otherwise shifts risk to Investors.

Now, let’s look at the GitHub readme.md file (found at https://github.com/slockit/DAO/blob/develop/README.md) :

Disclaimer
The future remains a work in progress. Our vision exists in a world where laws vary widely. It is important to remember that anyone who uses the generic DAO framework for The DAO or any other DAO will do so at their own risk. One can only speculate about the legal status of DAOs worldwide. Whatever one’s personal beliefs may be, people must draw their own conclusions, relying on legal advice where appropriate. The authors are not a law firm and are not in the business of offering legal advice.

If you create a DAO it will be your DAO, and you will be responsible for its operation.

Here, the readme.md attempts to shift risk from Slock.it to the Investor and the implementer of the code. In this case, however, Slock.it is the implementer of the code. 

Note: Although the word ""contract"" is used in The DAO’s code, the term is a programming convention and is not being used as a legal term of art. The term is a programming convention, not a representation that the code is in and of itself a legally binding and enforceable contract. If you have questions about legal enforceability, consult with legal counsel.

Here, the readme.md disclaims creating any legal and binding enforceable contract and urges participants to consult with legal counsel.

The DAO is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU lesser General Public License for more details.

Here, the readme.md file disclaims any warranties, and refers to the GNU General Public License.

h. Issuance of DAO tokens may constitute the sale of securities in certain jurisdictions. Seek appropriate legal advice before deploying DAO code.

Through this language, Slock.it disclaims the creation of a legally binding contract in any jurisdiction, instructs users to seek legal advice from a lawyer, and urges caution that its code may create securities (which seems to contradict what was noted on daohub.org).

Now, let’s look at the actual code files: Dao.sol (same found in DaoTokenCreationProxyTransfer.sol, DTHPool.sol, ManagedAccount.sol etc.) which contains the following comment:

The DAO is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU lesser General Public License for more details.
In the comments to the code itself, warranties are expressly disclaimed, and further reference is made to the GNU license. This suggests that the GNU license’s terms are integrated into the terms of the DAO as well.

So, are any of these terms enforceable against investors? Maybe. It is possible to invest in TheDao without reviewing any of the marketing materials on Daohub.org, on Slock.it’s Github, or the applicable code; thus, it is unclear whether each investor is aware of any of the disclaimers on any of these sources. Assuming that Investors have actually reviewed these sources, the disclaimer of entry into contract may preclude any of these terms from being enforceable at all- otherwise they could be viewed as illusory for lack of consideration flowing back to the Investor. Alternatively, the Investor may be imputed to awareness of the terms when contributing ETH to the DAO, whether or not any contract is or is not formed.  A Court could also impute that a contract exists despite the language stating otherwise. The provisions that attempt to impose a waiver against claims brought against third parties may be weakest, as it is not clear which activities are actually protected, and who may claim to be an intended beneficiary of those provisions, and thus, a third party (perhaps the Ethereum Foundation) may have difficulty if claiming to be a beneficiary of the waiver under that provision. 

The terms and disclosures above, however, do not reflect the activity of the system- which is only discernable by a review of the execution of the code itself. Thus, an Investor would have to be able to read and understand the functionality of the code to understand what the code will do, and then determine the risks of investment based upon their own analysis. While it may seem far-fetched, generally speaking, to expect every Investor to read and understand the code, parties to contracts are generally imputed to have understood their terms upon entry, except in cases like contracts of adhesion (i.e. agreements which may be voided because one party has unequal bargaining power, and the terms are unconscionably unfair). However, the fact that the DAO readme.md file and Daohub.org terms roundly disclaim any formation of any contract suggests that there may be more ambiguity in the construction of these terms than expected. 

2. Suing on Behalf Of, or Against The DAO is Challenging Because of a Likely Lack of  Standing

A lawsuit naming a DAO as a Defendant would likely stall immediately because of the difficulty of identifying a representative of the DAO with standing to represent it. The party served with process as a representative of a DAO (or the DAO) would likely move to quash service on the basis that they do not legally “represent” the DAO. The Court would then determine whether the person who was served appropriately represents the DAO for legal purposes. To make this determination, the Court would attempt to classify the DAO legally, and then, by analogy, determine who within that DAOs structure appropriately represents it. In certain jurisdictions, entities may not represent themselves pro se, and must be represented in litigation by a lawyer. This could, illogically, lead to claims for intervention by others (perhaps investors) who claim that the person designated to act for the DAO is acting without authority and perhaps to seek declaration that the lawyer is not authorized to act for the DAO because no person is authorized to subject the DAO to the jurisdiction of the court. To avoid this, a DAO may choose to designate an owner, manager, or legal representative. A DAO may choose to not designate a human representative to avoid regulatory interaction or potential liability. However, a lack of representative capacity will complicate any legal claims asserted, as it is unclear whether the various human actors affecting the DAO’s conduct (i.e. Creators, Investors, Curators, or Contractors in the case of the DAO) or the DAO itself, may actually represent the DAO. (If the DAO itself is recognized as a legally independent actor, its representative may be sued repeatedly, and those plaintiffs may attempt to hold that person personally liable.) Thus an analysis of DAO’s structure will likely be required.

DAOs may be analogized, based on their structure and function, to other legally recognized entities, but their lack of incorporation will preclude DAOs from exercising rights typically granted to incorporated entities. Incorporated entities are independent legal actors, and in most situations, claims related to the activity of the entity are brought against or on behalf of the entity, not its individual operators/investors/members. Business entities exist as individual actors with independent legal existence based upon the legal grant of power by governments. This grant of power created by force of law permits entities to exercise legal powers (for example, the power to enter contract on its behalf), and to shield individuals from individual liability for the actions of the entity. However, because DAOs are not typically incorporated, the traditional corporate shield protecting registered entities will likely not apply to protect the individuals acting under the DAO structure. Thus, a DAO will probably be considered an unincorporated association, or a general partnership. Although the analysis is nuanced, if a DAO is considered a general partnership, any partner (who those would be remains unclear) could represent the DAO and be sued and held fully liable for its debts. If it’s considered an “unincorporated association,” the analysis is more complex, but a participating member may be a representative of the association provided that a level of control over the association is established. 

The next question is one of geography- has the DAO submitted to the personal jurisdiction of your court? Because DAOs use pseudo-anonymous blockchains, identifying persons involved may be extremely difficult. Disclosures in the code of the DAO, or in the technical specifications of a Project Proposal may help identify creators of a DAO. (Slock.it is based out of Germany.) However, it may be extremely expensive and difficult to obtain jurisdiction over any person who represents a DAO where the injured plaintiff resides. Thus, litigants may be required to bring actions in multiple jurisdictions to obtain relief, and litigation against a DAO may be an economically impractical exercise.  Based upon the potential lack of domestic representatives appropriate for service, and the general difficulty of identifying participants, prospective plaintiffs may not be able to identify persons who can be served on behalf of a DAO.

3. Who May Have Claims Against Whom? 

Hypothetically, claims may be brought against the creators of the DAO for misrepresentations asserted to induce investment (i.e. related to marketing disclosures), improper design, function, and/or coding of the DAO itself (where behaviors of the DAO do not occur as expected because of technical errors or undisclosed/clandestine behaviors), or torts committed by the creators against the DAO (such as theft of assets through otherwise undisclosed intrusion vectors). In this case, the question of whether a contract exists or not is critical. If there is no contract, then the provision of ETH in exchange for DAO Tokens could be considered a bailment (i.e. the creators are holding ETH) and the loss of those ETH (to the extent that they are not available for a split) could be considered the breach of a bailment relationship, entitling the investor to damages. Likewise, in the case of faulty design, negligence claims seem likely.

Likewise, it is possible that claims may be brought against a Contractor who promotes a Proposal to a DAO, if the Contractor makes misrepresentations as to the attributes, functionality, or expectation of repayment related to a Proposal, or if a Proposal fails to fulfill its repayment obligation to the DAO, whether intentionally (i.e. by fraud, or by absconding with the funds), mistakenly (as a result of a hack), or negligently (because of an internal coding error, or data breach). It is unclear whether investors would be determined to have contractual privity with a Project Contractor (who must be another investor), as it is unclear if any parties to the DAO have any privity with any other party based on the disclaimers provided with its marketing materials. If the proposal run that causes a loss event is a split (i.e. is not voted upon by the investors) then it is possible that, depending on the circumstances, there may be a claim for theft and the civil claim of conversion. However, the ETH held by the DAO is no longer held by the investors, so they could probably only bring such a claim as derivative on behalf of the DAO.

Curators may have liability for “whitelisting” a Proposal that fails or does not behave as represented. Curators may also have joint liability with Contractors for a Proposal coding error that results in harm to the Investors. Curators may likewise have liability for dishonest behavior intended to benefit themselves, or some participants in a DAO at the expense of others. If there is no contractual relationship, a curator who whitelisted a malicious proposal may have liability for aiding and abetting or conspiring with a proposal contractor who causes injury to investors, although as noted above, the underlying claim for the conspiracy or aiding and abetting liability may not be clear.

Investors potentially could bring claims against other Investors, either individually, or derivatively on behalf of the DAO, or as a class (except that proceeding as a class was purportedly waived in Daohub.org’s terms), for acts that subject the investment base of a DAO to risk, including for any improper voting behavior, for conspiring with Curators to promote their own self-interest, or due to “management decisions” made by sub-classes of Investors with disproportionate voting power. Here, the Exploiter is an Investor who offered a split which resulted in the investment base of the DAO to be siphoned off into a child DAO under the Exploiter’s exclusive control. 

Let’s look at some specific legal theories that may provide relief against the Exploiter:

A. Theft/conversion 

A claim for theft would allege that the Exploiter took what did not belong to him/her/them or took something without authority to do so, and that doing so damaged someone else. The Exploiter, according to the governance schema, should not have been able to take more than their own ETH into their own child DAO. However, by exploiting a bug, the Exploiter was able to do just that. Thus, a conversion claim may be available, provided that the court determines that the Exploiter was bound to the governance schema. The civil claim, for conversion, requires a plaintiff to have ownership rights, the defendant to have intentionally interfered with those rights /exercised domain and control of those rights, deprived the plaintiff of possession and use, and cased damage. Thus, an Investor alleging theft would have to show some basis to assert that he or she has ownership rights in the holdings of the DAO. This contention is unclear; the ability to split and recover invested ETH suggests a contingent claim on some of the DAO’s assets.

An investor individually could show standing by failing to get 1.0ETH per 100 DAO Tokens after a split (which takes about 2 months), and sue for the difference between what they expected to get out versus what was left to take out via split. Alternatively, an investor could attempt to represent the DAO derivatively for this claim, claiming that the DAO itself was injured. (Note that Investors purportedly waive class action according to Daohub.org) As noted above, standing on behalf of the DAO is difficult to determine in the absence of a designated representative.  

B. Breach of Bailment Claim

As the marketing materials and code suggest that no legal contract exists, an alternative interpretation would be that the DAO created a bailment relationship- wherein the DAO held ETH for Investors, and that it failed to hold them. (This is the same claim you might bring if the valet who parked your car instead lost your car). This claim could be brought by an Investor against the DAO, which, again, may be impossible to serve. 

C. Tortious Interference Claim.

Investors could attempt to individually sue the Exploiter for tortious interference with business relationships. To allege tortious interference a party must show a valid contract or economic expectancy between the plaintiff and a 3rd person, knowledge of the contract or expectancy by the defendant, intent by defendant to interference with the contract, actual interference, lack of justification, privilege or excuse (i.e. was improper to interfere), resulting in damage. An investor may show a business relationship with the DAO (which, depending on jurisdiction may or may not require a contract), knowledge of the investor’s relationship to the DAO (maybe, because the existence of token holders is public knowledge, but any individual investor’s participation is not necessarily public), intent and actual interference are likely established (by taking ETH which would have existed for investment or for withdrawal via split). This leaves lack of justification, privilege or excuse and actual damage. These elements may be tricky, as the Exploiter may use the fact that it was a bug and not a hack to establish justification, privilege or excuse. The exploiter may also contest if there are actual money damages. However, the drop in market value of DAO Tokens and ETH, along with the reduction in the DAO’s investment funds may suffice.

D. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 

Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §1030(a)(4) “Whoever … knowingly and with intent to defraud, accesses a protected computer without authorization, or exceeds authorized access and by means of such conduct furthers the intended fraud and obtains anything of value, unless the object of the fraud and the thing obtained consists only of the use of the computer and the value of such use is not more than $5,000 in any 1-year period.” Although this claim sounds simple, the interpretation and implementation is complex and quickly evolving. The threshold question is whether the Exploiter “exceeds authorized access.” An argument may be offered that the Exploiter exceeded his/her/their authorized access by taking funds that were not rightfully theirs. Again, this claim would be brought by the DAO. 

Contract-based claims like breach of contract, violation of good faith and fair dealing and even quantum meruit (and its equitable cousin, unjust enrichment) may fail as a result of the express disclaimer of contract formation found in the marketing materials related to the DAO. If a court imputes a contract, any number of contract-based claims, including breach of contract, or breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, may be available as well. However, proper waivers are generally legally enforceable; thus, a claimant Investor is probably resigned to seeking equitable, tort, statutory, and/or other non-contract based claims.

4. Ethereum Foundation’s Potential Responses

The Ethereum Foundation was alerted to the exploit at about 3:09am EST on Friday. The log of the chat opened by Foundation members (many of whom are also curators of and apparently heavily invested in the DAO) is riveting and shows that a multitude of approaches were discussed early on, including hard fork, soft fork, and a roll back. Within 30 minutes of the discovery of the exploit, the Ethereum Foundation caused exchanges to suspend Ethereum withdrawals and trading. The chat log includes discussion of coping mechanisms aimed at preventing a crash in the value of ETH. Both of the below discussed fork-based solutions are notable in that they are not to be implemented by the DAO, but contemplate Ethereum itself modifying its blockchain to fix the DAO’s exploit. Of course, while the Ethereum Foundation can propose whatever software modification it wants, but unless the majority of miners adopt the new code, none of the proposed Ethereum-driven solutions will go into effect.

a. Hard fork:

The proposed hard fork would move all stolen ETH funds into a new wallet which would be used to refund investors in the DAO and shut down the DAO. Slock.it has already advocated for the hard fork solution. Others have argued that the hard fork undermines the credibility of the Ethereum platform, creates legal risk for developers, (and potentially excuses for third parties such as law enforcement to intervene) and rewards participants in an experiment who should have understood their risk.

b. Soft fork:

The proposed soft fork would create code that would permit miners to selectively invalidate transactions, and intends for those miners to invalidate transactions made using the ETH taken by the Exploiter. This approach would permit DAO Token transfers to continue and permit the Dao functions that do not touch ETH to continue. (So much for fungibility.) This would permit miners to lock the stolen ETH and the DAO’s ETH. Advocates of this approach suggest that the soft fork would be less damaging because it would be reversible and buys time for more elegant solutions to be devised. Detractors point out the same centralization arguments as above. The soft fork may introduce further havoc by providing miners with discretion as to what transactions they may block. Despite the risks, the soft fork approach appears to be favored.

c. Problems with either forking option:

Is the DAO too big to fail, and should it be bailed out? That’s the real question being considered here. Although the motivations behind forking appear compassionate and directed at stabilizing Ethereum and the DAO, these solutions may ultimately destabilize Ethereum and the DAO. As argued by Pelle Braendgaard, neither Ethereum nor the DAO are incorporated like conventional entities, but they substitute the legally-bestowed corporate veil that shields an entity’s underlying actors from liability with the veil of decentralization.  Provided that the system is executed via decentralized actors, creators are not liable. However, if a hard or soft fork is implemented to correct the exploit, by violating the decentralization the creators and those who maintain these platforms may be subjecting themselves to arguments that they have taken or the ability to take, control at any time, which may result in personal liability. Of course, any proposed fork must be ratified by miner adoption, but even consideration of a fork of any kind to resolve what is at its core a flaw of the DAO, and not the Ethereum blockchain, is troubling. Although Slock.it may have potential liability for the exploit, by forking, the Ethereum Foundation may be taking on potential liability.

Braendgaard’s point is well taken. If Ethereum intervenes to roll back transactions or sequester funds, the claim of decentralization or immutability is shown to be illusory. This may even invite claims by the Exploiter against the Ethereum Foundation for taking away the ETH obtained by the exploit. (It is understood that many Ethereum Foundation members are heavily invested in the DAO.) A fork would be viewed as a “bank bail-out,” potentially self-serving, and those with the power to do so may be looked at as responsible.

d. Counterattack

The DAO creators, Slock.it, suggested a counter-attack, seeking to take advantage of the same exploit, to prevent the child Dao from seizing the Eth as a solution to the exploit. This suggestion itself validates the approach of the Exploiter as legitimate system functionality. As noted by P Gun Sirer, it is also a very risky approach. However, it may be favorable compared to the hard and soft forks noted above. 

e. Bitcoin’s Mt. Gox Approach:

Bitcoin had a mass loss event in the well-publicized Mt. Gox disaster. As a result of Mt. Gox, bitcoin users were unable to control their bitcoin and functionally lost hundreds of millions of dollars of value. In the wake of Mt. Gox, bitcoin valuation against USD plummeted, the platform was pilloried in the media, and many predicted its doom. Yet, there was no split, or roll back or freezing of assets to try to reclaim bitcoin for those affected. Today, Bitcoin continues to exist as a decentralized immutable platform, and is at a total market cap approaching its all-time high. Perhaps the Ethereum community should look at Mt. Gox before endangering its platform with knee jerk reactions for the benefit of a subset of the Ethereum users who risked participation in the DAO.

Although many investors holding DAO Tokens may be frustrated with the exploit, and rightfully bemoan their loss of millions of dollars, the overcorrection of forking to reclaim those ETH may be more disastrous long term than permitting the exploit to persist. The exploit is a problem for the DAO, not for Ethereum, unless Ethereum is more concerned with the trade value of its ETH than it is with the integrity of the transactions occurring on its blockchain. A fork invites the slippery slope argument – when in the future will the fork reverse my latest transaction, and for what reason, and under what circumstances?  Will future smart contract failures all call for corrective forks as well? The exploit’s only impact on Ethereum was to cause the value of Ethereum against the USD to drop. Thus, a fork smacks of arbitrary rulemaking and control group self-interest, and has been predicted to have a negative effect on the viability of ETH as an economic asset. A fork that permits Investors to reclaim their ETH but crushes the value of ETH by impairing the viability of the platform long-term may cause more damage than the loss caused by the the DAO exploit.

5. Exploiter’s Potential Claim Against the Ethereum Foundation

The Exploiter, having taken advantage of a system coding error as opposed to having actively hacked the DAO (although better minds than mine may draw the line between the two, I will not) may actually have a claim against the Ethereum Foundation if they offer a hard or soft fork to Ethereum miners that functionally freezes the ETH to be supplied to the child DAO or reverses any transfer of ETH to the Exploiter. The Exploiter, claiming to have not violated any laws, may actually seek to enjoin the Ethereum Foundation from taking any action to restrict his/her/their use of the ETH in the child DAO created by the exploit. The Exploiter could also claim tortious interference with his/her/their rights to the child DAO they created using the DAO according to the “terms” of its code. Although these claims would require the Exploiter to identify themselves, there is an argument to be made that the Ethereum Foundation itself may be liable for taking away assets obtained by the Exploiter through the permitted use of the DAO. However, if the ETH are deemed stolen, then the Exploiter cannot show legal title or a viable claim to the funds, and these claims would fail. 

Conclusion

The law is unprepared for the DAO and the DAO is unprepared for the law. The disclosures, terms and legal warnings are inconsistent and confused.  Although it mimics the structure and behavior of a registered business entity, because it avoids compliance with registration requirements by operating as a distributed software platform lacking executives, directors, legal jurisdiction of incorporation or physical location it will likely not be provided with the same legal recognition, or be provided the rights and privileges typically provided to registered entities. Thus, in the instance of a lawsuit, a court will be forced to grapple with the implications of a web of contracts and computer code imitating an entity, but without the infrastructure created by statutes, and centuries of common law precedent and civil law interpretation that guide courts when considering claims regarding incorporated entities. Because of the lack of recognized legal form, the DAO and other unregistered DAOs will create significant impediments to involved parties seeking to obtain dispute resolution related to their activities involving DAOs from courts, which suggests that specialized proprietary alternate dispute resolution (“ADR”) provisions may be necessary. The disposition or determination of claims alleged by Investors against the DAO, against the Creators of the DAO, or against the Exploiter who took ETH via bug exploit remain uncertain. However, the exploit will likely be considered a type of theft, and investors, if they can establish standing to act for the DAO, may have a variety of claims.

2016/6/28,Circle Bets Big on China Amid New Capital Raise,"“Bitcoin bank” Circle is betting big on China. The company has announced that it raised $60 million in a new Series D funding round led by Beijing-based investment firm IDG Capital, an existing Circle investor. The company also announced the opening of its Chinese subsidiary Circle China, which had been separately funded earlier.

Participants in the new Circle funding round include global venture capital and private equity firm, Breyer Capital, General Catalyst Partners and a group of Chinese firms including; Baidu, China International Capital Corporation ALPHA, China Everbright Limited, Wanxiang and CreditEase. Individual investors include Sam Palmisano, former CEO and chairman of IBM, and Glenn Hutchins, co-founder of private equity firm Silver Lake.

Circle now has a solid network of partners in the region, notably including technology giant Baidu.

“Circle is one of the most impressive startups in the blockchain technology space,” said Peter Fang, executive director of Baidu corporate development. “Together with other influential investors, Baidu is very excited to partner with Circle team to build its vision successfully and globally.""

Circle co-founders Sean Neville and Jeremy Allaire noted that the company is building a global payments network that will soon enable users in the U.S., Europe and China to exchange value seamlessly and nearly instantly.

“Today we announced two related milestones: a $60 million strategic financing from a syndicate of major Chinese strategic investors; and the formation of Circle China, a new Beijing-based company focused on bringing the benefit of open, global, blockchain-powered social payments to Chinese consumers,” said Neville and Allaire. “We want to connect consumers using dollars, pounds, euro and renminbi the same way that the web, email and other protocols have connected consumers globally.”

Circle China was formed six months ago as an independent Chinese company focused on bringing the benefits of open, global social payments to Chinese consumers, with a multi-million-dollar seed investment from many of the strategic investors in the new Series D round. Circle emphasizes its commitment to developing a China-native company with major Chinese owners and investors in both Circle China and Circle Global and being fully compliant with the laws and regulations of the Chinese payments and banking regime.

""We're not aiming to compete with the domestic market as that would be a suicide mission given the strength of local players like Alipay and WeChat but we can connect Chinese consumers with the euro zone and dollar markets,"" Allaire told Reuters, adding that Circle China has not yet launched a product, pending a deal with a local banking partner and a legal license to operate. 

“IDG is very bold on Circle’s vision of blockchain and social payment,” said Hugo Shong, founding general partner of IDG Capital. “Just like the success of Alipay and WeChat pay here in China, we have full confidence in Circle team building global products which will be enjoyed by hundreds of millions of people daily.” 

According to Circle’s founders, Chinese consumers will play a much bigger role in the global economy in the coming years. Therefore the renminbi will become a much more important currency in the world. Neville and Allaire mentioned remittances sent home by Chinese students and young professionals abroad as an important application of Circle’s services.

In April, Bitcoin Magazine reported that Circle was granted an e-money license by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority and started offering British Circle users the ability to hold GBP and make GBP payments instantly with zero fees. Now the company is announcing that it is opening Circle Euro support to consumers in Spain as the first part of a broader European-wide rollout to occur over the coming month, once some remaining regulatory obstacles have been cleared.

“‘Lighting up Euro’ on Circle’s platform is critical in our effort to enable consumers everywhere to share value and is also important to our efforts in China,” noted Neville and Allaire, adding that the company is on track to exceed a billion dollars in transaction volume on an annual basis and the global customer base has grown by 300 percent over the past 12 months.

Forbes notes that Circle currently uses the Bitcoin blockchain, as opposed to alternative or private blockchains, to settle payments. In fact, in November Allaire wrote a thoughtful analysis of the blockchain vs. bitcoin issue and explained the advantages of the Bitcoin blockchain over alternative implementations. However, Allaire noted that Circle is open to using any public blockchain as long as it has good software support, distribution among merchants and consumers, a global liquid market and enough scale to be secure, as reported by Forbes.",Law & Justice,0.9971
2016/6/29,The Securities Law Implications of the DAO Hack and Proposed Ethereum Hard Fork,"The top five blockchain crowdsales bore out of the Bitcoin 2.0 movement have raised more than a quarter-of-a-billion dollars in “initial coin offerings,” “token sales” and the like. Participants contend the blockchain tokens are going “to the moon.” Others argue, since they’ve never been registered, they run afoul of securities law.

The second largest crowdsale and best known, is Ethereum at $18,439,086. Ethereum developers say their blockchain is a distributed smart-contract platform “fueled” by a native digital currency similar to Bitcoin. Ethereum’s 2014 “Ether sale” preceded it’s May 2016 crowdsale for the DAO, a so-called “decentralized autonomous organization” managed via Ethereum smart contracts.

Ethereum and DAO developers currently face scrutiny in the wake of a $55 million compromise of the DAO by an attacker. They are deciding whether to intervene and undo the damage done by the draining of funds. 

DAO token holders, who purchased the tokens with Ether, vote on “important decisions relating to the management of the DAO,” the project claims. The DAO had raised Ethereum worth over $200 million at the time of the attack. 

The top five blockchain crowdsales: the DAO, Ethereum, WAVES, Lisk, Digix and Augur, have raised approximately $200 million. Nearly $170 million of that is Ethereum and the DAO. 

Lisk, a cryptocurrency and decentralized application platform, raised $5,880,089 in an “initial coin offering” in 2016. Lisk founders worked on the code for three weeks before going public. 

“In the following three weeks we built up enough momentum to start our crowdfunding,” Lisk co-founder, Max Kordek, told me. The crowdfunding went on for one month and Lisk brought in more than 14,000 bitcoins. 

Kordek emphasizes the importance of marketing and calls Lisk’s “intensive marketing campaign” a “huge success.” 

Securities Law

Developers say they are providing access to software, not securities. The literature is littered with finance and security terms. Securities laws are broadly interpreted and designed to be adaptable to the innovative ways people raise funds. 

Congress developed federal securities law after the stock market crash of 1929. The speculative frenzy ending in the October 1929 panic, called “Black Thursday,”led Congress to enact the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1945 (the “Exchange Act”). 

State blue sky laws, Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations, as well as regulations from the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) combine to create securities law. 

SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. (1946) set the precedent that an investment contract entails the giving of money to others who manage and control the funds with the expectation of profit.

Blockchain crowdsales market that token holders and “community” participants themselves, enjoy management and control of the blockchain software. Indicating that they, themselves, help build the blockchain platform over time. DAO participants, for instance, use Ether toward the DAO projects they support. Lisk says that participants earn Lisk for bug bounties. 

If blockchain crowdsale participants enjoy management and control, then it’s arguably not an investment contract or security. Still, developers generally lack management and control over an enterprise in the real world.

Who would shareholders petition to obtain redress when something goes awry? Core developers on Ethereum, etc. argue that “smart contracts,” that is, the distributed software itself, handles everything.

Jason Seibert, a lawyer who serves on Bitcoin and securities cases, described a typical blockchain crowdsale: “Hey, give us some money and we are going to develop something. We are not quite sure what it is yet but when we do, you’ll be able to use this stuff for it, even though we don’t know what it is yet.”

Even if the blockchain crowdsales are, in fact, crowdsales and not securities offerings, they must still be registered under the JOBS Act and regulation. 

Illustrating the nuance of securities laws, Seibert evokes baseball cards:

“Nobody thinks baseball card manufacturers print baseball cards with the intent of them being an investment,” the Oregon-based lawyer, who represented Trendon Shavers in the first Bitcoin criminal fraud case in the U.S., said. “Come on, it’s sold in a pack of gum! But everyone knows that people can collect them and trade them and make money off of them.” 

Blockchain crowdsales come across much differently. They’re not bubble gum and pictures of athletes. “We’re talking about an investment opportunity,” Seibert says. 

Heretofore, blockchain crowdsales have enjoyed the unwritten “good deal exception,” wherein, since everybody is happy, nobody files lawsuits or tips off relevant officials. 

That the DAO smart contract platform was drained of $55 million and core Ethereum developers are considering implementing a fork to roll back the perceived heist, it remains to be seen if the “good deal exception” will soon expire. An SEC official commented June 20 that the $55 million attack against Ethereum underscores concerns over blockchain systems.

Thanks to the DAOs code, Ethereum developers could intervene and undo the $55 million drain. But that might be used in a court against them as proof they held control over Ethereum and the DAO. The DAO would not have truly been a “decentralized autonomous organism,” as advertised, and participants could then be seen as misled investors. 

“You’ll generally hear an investor say, ‘Had I know this-or-that, perhaps I would not have invested,” Seibert explained. ",Law & Justice,0.2023
2016/6/30,How Governments Subsidize Bitcoin's Usefulness and the Bitcoin Price,"Bitcoin Fulfills a Need in the Market

There are many types of applications that people want to build with blockchain technology but only a minor fraction of these projects have found any use in the real world. While there are plenty of techno-geeks who think it’s cool to play around with various cryptocurrencies and blockchain-related projects, Bitcoin seems to be the only blockchain system that has seen use outside of those who are tech-savvy.

“We see that a lot of the people that are using Bitcoin (locally and looking at the exchanges) are using Bitcoin because they need to use it,” DeRose said. “They have to use it because they can’t use fiat.

“This is what has differentiated Bitcoin from other blockchain projects, in that Bitcoin fulfills a need,” DeRose added.

Some areas where Bitcoin is truly needed include online gambling and darknet marketplaces. These sorts of use cases also fuel the view of Bitcoin as a digital gold.

Fungibility a Huge Part of This Need

When it comes to the situations where Bitcoin is needed, fungibility plays a huge role. DeRose referred to this use case as “the ability to convert value into anonymous value.”

When asked about the importance of fungibility in Bitcoin, Todd said, “Yeah, I think that’s Bitcoin’s main use case there. If you didn’t have that as a need, you could just go use PayPal.

“The most clever thing governments could do to kill Bitcoin is make anonymous, electronic cash,” Todd added.

Of course, it’s also true that there’s plenty of room for improvement in terms of Bitcoin’s fungibility. New privacy improvements, such as Confidential Transactions, may eventually offer assistance here. JoinMarket, a market for CoinJoin transactions, is another project that is already helping users gain more effective privacy on the blockchain right now.

Governments Subsidize Bitcoin with Their Regulations

Since Bitcoin is mostly needed in situations where fungibility is a must, it isn’t much of a stretch to say that governments essentially subsidize the usefulness of Bitcoin because government-backed restrictions and censorship on financial transactions are a major factor in the need for a fungible bearer ecash.

When asked if he thinks governments are issuing regulatory subsidies for the existence of the Bitcoin blockchain, Todd responded, “I think that’s pretty much exactly what’s happened.”

Todd then went on to talk about the abandoned MintChip project in Canada, which was essentially an attempt to create an anonymous, electronic cash system. “It appears they axed [the project] because nobody wanted to go and create anonymous, electronic cash. They just didn’t have the willpower to do it,” explained Todd.

Does Bitcoin Have Government to Thank for Its Existence?

This gets to the question of when it makes sense to use a blockchain. Are they still useful in a world where governments allow anonymous ecash to exist at a large scale? “It may only make sense when the regulatory environment allows it to make sense,” DeRose noted.

Todd put this thought experiment another way: Would Tor be interesting or useful if governments didn’t wiretap their citizens? The answer here is obviously yes because governments are not the only “adversaries” in the world. The Tor Project has a list of the types of people who use the anonymizing network on their website.

While there may be some use cases of bitcoin that don’t involve getting around government regulations, it’s clear that these government-avoiding use cases are what propelled Bitcoin to what it is today. Bitcoin first rose in popularity due to Silk Road and the financial blockade on Wikileaks. Silk Road allowed Bitcoin users to buy and sell goods and services that had been criminalized by various governments around the world, while Wikileaks is a journalistic organization that runs on donations ‒ strictly via bitcoin during the financial blockade.

It’s unclear whether Bitcoin would have taken the digital world by storm if these sorts of use cases didn’t exist early on in the technology’s development. The level of distrust in the world’s financial system at the time (and to this day) also couldn’t have hurt.",Law & Justice,0.296
2016/7/8,"Renowned Futurists Merkle, Hanson on the Future of Government Using DAOs and Prediction Markets","In May, Bitcoin Magazine covered the spectacular launch of The DAO, a new kind of organization created and run using blockchain software rather than conventional corporate structures. The DAO ‒ an acronym for Distributed Autonomous Organization ‒ is similar to an open venture capital fund based on Ethereum smart contracts and rapidly became the world’s largest crowdfunding to date.

Shortly after its launch, The DAO had an equally spectacular crash caused by poorly understood aspects of its implementation of smart contracts, which a malicious attacker was able to exploit.

Emin Gun Sirer of Cornell University told The Economist, “the attacker simply read the terms and conditions more closely than anyone else.”

Regardless of misfortunes and temporary setbacks that are only to be expected in the early phases of a new technology with a potentially disruptive impact, DAOs have a huge potential. According to futurist David Orban, The DAO can be a pathfinder and a model for very ambitious crowdfunded initiatives to tackle important challenges, including a new global phase of the space program.

“From the $10 million order of magnitude crowdsales two years ago, to the $100 million crowdsale today, we will get to $1 billion in a couple of years, and then to $10 billion in another two-three,” he said.

Now, other renowned cryptographers, technologists and economists specialized in future studies are starting to weigh in. Futurist Ralph Merkle, who is also one of the inventors of public key cryptography, the inventor of cryptographic hashing and the originator of the “Merkle Trees” used in blockchain systems including Bitcoin and Ethereum, has published a paper titled “DAOs, Democracy and Governance.” Merkle’s thesis is that DAOs and crowdsourcing could lead to a new form of democracy which is more stable, less prone to erratic behavior, better able to meet the needs of its citizens and which better uses the expertise of all its citizens to make high-quality decisions.

“We call this new form of democracy a DAO Democracy,” says Merkle. “Further analysis and small-scale implementations combined with further research into their effectiveness, seem both warranted and urgently needed, given the range of problems facing humanity today and the more pressing problems anticipated in the future.”

Futarchy, proposed by futurist Robin Hanson, a professor of economy at George Mason University and the author of a much discussed recent book about radically futuristic economy, is a proposal to govern by prediction markets. “The proposal seems like an excellent approach for improving upon existing democratic forms of governance,” says Merkle.

Prediction markets are speculative markets created for the purpose of making predictions. The current market price for a prediction ‒ for example the election of a particular candidate ‒ can be interpreted as an aggregate, crowdsourced estimate of the probability of the prediction. Hanson, a leading prediction market researcher, was all over the news in 2003, when the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a prediction market proposed by the United States' Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and based on Hanson’s ideas, was canceled after a wave of accusations of incentivizing terrorism, which resulted in the resignation of John Poindexter, head of the DARPA unit responsible for developing the project.

In her 2015 book “Blockchain: Blueprint for a New Economy,” dedicated to advanced future applications of distributed ledger technology beyond currency (“Blockchain 1.0”) and smart contracts (“Blockchain 2.0”), futurist Melanie Swan defines futarchy as two-step democracy with voting plus prediction markets.

“The first step would be carried out by regular voting processes, the second step via prediction markets,” explains Swan. “Prediction market voting could be by different [cryptocurrencies] or other economically significant tokens. Prediction market voting is investing/speculating, taking a bet on one or the other side of a proposal, betting on the proposal that you want to win. As with random-sampling elections, blockchain technology could more efficiently implement the futarchy concept in an extremely large-scale manner (decentralized, trusted, recorded, pseudonymous.) The futarchy concept is described in shorthand as ‘vote for values, bet on beliefs,’ an idea initially proposed by economist Robin Hanson and expounded in the blockchain context by Ethereum project founder Vitalik Buterin.”

According to Swan, who founded the Institute for Blockchain Studies to examine the theoretical, philosophical and societal implications of blockchain technology, blockchain-based futarchy could became a common, widespread norm and feature or mechanism for all complex multi-party human decision-making. “One effect of this could be a completely new level of coordinated human activity that would be orders of magnitude more complex than at present,” notes Swan, cautioning that, of course, any new governance structure including futarchy has ample room for abuse.

“I’m encouraged that some people might actually try out versions of futarchy,” Hanson told Bitcoin Magazine. “It is perhaps unfortunate that they face especially difficult governance problems. But still, I’d love to see a head-to-head comparison with other mechanisms in most any governance context.”

Hanson isn’t entirely happy with Merkle’s proposal, however. In a blog post titled “Merkle’s Futarchy,” he worries about the possibility that futarchy implementations could ignore or sidestep the cautions and safeguards that were an important part of his original proposal, and criticizes what he sees as weak points of Merkle’s proposed implementation. “I’m happy to see the new interest in futarchy, but I’m also worried that sloppy design may cause failures that are blamed on the overall concept instead of on implementation details,” notes Hanson. “As recently happened to the DAO concept.”",Law & Justice,0.6232
2016/7/11,A Lawyer’s Perspective: Can Smart Contracts Exist Outside the Legal Structure?,"Editor's Note: This is a guest post by Richard Howlett, Solicitor at Selachii LLP London.

There can be no debate that technological development has never been as fast, as complex or as creative as it is today. The only problem is, as with all revolutions, when things are moving this fast one has to be very careful when it comes to separating innovation from irritation; as more new tech is made available we have to develop that sixth sense that will allow us to separate what will actually help us from what definitely won’t. 

Let’s take fintech (and I’d include Bitcoin and blockchain under that umbrella) as an example:  

This is an area that commercial litigation firms are coming into contact with more and more. Given that we are currently in the midst of a digital revolution, the scale of which we have never seen before and will probably never see again, I think we all agree digital currency and digital transactions aren’t only progress but an inevitability.  

Yes, there are – as there are with all new ideas – some legal and accounting wrinkles to iron out, but the initial take-up for digital currency would suggest it has some fairly muscular legs to grow into.

However, on the fringes of the fintech world we have seen some worrying developments. Buzzwords that long-term could prove to be as damaging as they are misleading in the short-term. 

""Smart contracts"" seem to be the buzzwords that are gaining increasing traction in the digital market. It is a sound enough idea, a contract that will rewrite itself according to commercial circumstances surrounding it by using a complex series of rules embedded in its coding. 

The ideas behind it are equally as sound theoretically. Less input from the contracting parties means that smart contracts will come into being quicker and, therefore, allow for transactions to be raised and completed more quickly.  Also, the fact that smart contracts require less input from both the parties involved and their lawyers, will make commerce more fluid and more cost-effective both in terms of time and legal fees.

The only potential problem is that once you get past the theory and examine the practical with a legal eye, you start to see that it is actually difficult to consider a smart contract as either smart or a contract and that it is probably more accurate to drop the term smart contract; instead, referring to them as automated computer code. 

For those among you who think my stance may come from the fact that I’m a solicitor who is worried smart contracts might eat into my practice, I shall explain why smart contracts – in their current form at least – are not fit for purpose.  

The first thing to consider is why a contract is required in the first place: It is there to protect the personal and/or commercial interests of the parties, which means it is contingent on two key sources:

The prior agreement of the parties on the heads of terms included within the contract.
The legal experience required to turn those heads of terms into a viable legal document.
Once that contract is in place, coding could provide continued support for that contract and, indeed, for similar contracts involving similar terms for similar transactions. I would even suggest the code could probably even be taught to make small alterations as long as those alterations were foreseeable and logical.  

However, I am highly cynical about a code’s ability to make more complex binding/sustainable legal decisions required to build the foundations of a robust commercial contract or negotiate the best possible terms for all of the parties involved. This means that in the first instance at least, a lawyer will still need to be involved.

Also, code works on linear decision-making and probability, but more often than not, finding the right answer to settle a particular contractual nuance is a much more lateral process and requires a level of creativity and flexibility that can come only from real-life experience.  To inject that depth of practical experience into code is, I would suggest, a nigh on impossible task. 

This takes us on to another potential failing: If things turn sour between the contracted parties, who is there to sort things out? There is a common myth that a smart contract cannot be litigated, but I would disagree. As long as the heads of terms that sit behind the contracts are clear – and have clearly been accepted by the parties – there is scope to litigate if the code is deemed not to be fit for purpose or has affected the transactions it is meant to support and/or the payments associated with those transactions.

This is, however, where things could get more complicated.  As there is currently no international internet law, the original contract would have to set out the jurisdictions of the parties and which country’s law the contract is reliant upon. Again, these aren’t decisions that code can make, so these definitions and agreements would have to be made by people, quite possibly with specialist legal advice.  

And that is why I don’t believe that smart contracts in their current form can be considered smart or contracts. As I said earlier, I don’t want this to come across as just another defensive letter of self-preservation from a lawyer in fear of losing fees. As an experienced litigator who has fought for years to ensure my clients always get the best possible protection from their commercial contracts, it concerns me is that an idea or even just a buzzword could lead numerous businesses into difficult and potentially very costly situations just because they had bought into the next big thing.",Law & Justice,0.4939
2016/7/25,"Miami Judge Rules Bitcoin Is Not Money; Dismisses Money Laundering, Transmitting Charges","Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Teresa Pooler has dismissed a money-laundering case involving an alleged “illegal sale” of bitcoins, after declaring that under the laws of the state, the digital currency is not considered to be a form of money.

Defendant Michell Espinoza was arrested after being accused of selling bitcoins to undercover detectives who told him that they were interested in purchasing $1,500 worth of bitcoins in order to obtain robbed credit card numbers.

Florida law enforcement charged Espinoza with one count of operating as an unauthorized money transmitter and one count of money laundering. A second man, Pascal Reid, was also arrested. Reid has since been sentenced to probation for operating as an unlicensed money broker.

The State had initially charged Espinoza as operating as an unauthorized “money transmitter,” but later amended the term to “a payment instrument seller.” A payment instrument, strictly speaking, refers to “a check, draft, warrant money order, traveler’s check, electronic instrument or...monetary value whether or not negotiable.”

According to Pooler, “Bitcoin does not fall under the statutory definition of ‘payment instrument’...nor does Bitcoin fit into one of the defined categories listed.”

“At this time...attempting to fit the sale of Bitcoin into a statutory scheme regulating money services businesses is like fitting a square peg in a round hole.”

The judge then dismissed the money laundering charges, declaring that under the current regulations of the state, Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are not considered money.

“The Court is not an expert in economics, however, it is very clear, even to someone with limited knowledge in the area, that Bitcoin has a long way to go before it the equivalent of money,” a section of Pooler’s order read.

Pooler further noted that the case was too vague to apply to a digital currency, and explained that the court cannot punish the defendant for selling his property to another.

“This court is unwilling to punish a man for selling his property to another, when his actions fall under a statute that is so vaguely written that even legal professionals have difficulty finding a singular meaning,” she stated.

The case, which was closely observed by the Bitcoin community since the first hearing on May 27, is said to be the first prosecution to define the legality of Bitcoin in the United States. This digital currency-related money-laundering case garnered extra interest since defense witness Charles Evans, a Barry University economics professor, was paid $3,000 worth of Bitcoin for his testimony.

Evans told the court that under state law Bitcoin is closer to a property than an actual coin because of the digital currency’s lack of dependence on a centralized or public authority. Comparing the action to trading “poker chips,” Evans made the case that dealing in Bitcoin is simply bartering.

Pooler stated, “This is the most fascinating thing I’ve heard in this courtroom in a long time.”

Bitcoin, which is considered an intangible asset in many countries, including Canada, Australia and Croatia, is still not considered a legal currency in most regions around the world, including the United States. While many countries around the world haven’t establish a proper regulatory framework for the digital currency, the Miami-Dade money-laundering case concludes that Bitcoin is not considered a legal currency in the United States.",Law & Justice,-0.2732
2016/8/2,Alibaba's Ant Financial Joins Quest for Transparency in Charitable Transactions,"In February, Bitcoin Magazine reported that Alipay, an online payment platform of the Chinese e-commerce corporation Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., had announced a project based on blockchain technology and cloud services. The announcement indicated the growing interest of Alibaba in distributed ledger technology.

Now, it appears that the Chinese giant is gradually committing to the blockchain. Ant Financial, the Alibaba company that operates Alipay, is using distributed ledgers to transparently record transactions and improve the accountability of Chinese philanthropic organizations, Bloomberg Technology reports.

Ant Financial dominates the online payments market in China through its Alipay service, which has more than 450 million annual active users and has been compared to PayPal. Credit Suisse estimates that that 58 percent of China’s online payment transactions go through Alipay. The company also operates a money-market fund called Yu’e Bao and an online bank called MYbank.The name Ant refers to the small merchants — myriads of hardworking ants — who sell goods through Alibaba, The Wall Street Journal explains.

Ant Financial was spun off as a stand-alone company before the $25 billion Alibaba initial public offering in 2014 and is expected to launch its own IPO. The company completed a new $4.5 billion funding round in April as reported by The Financial Times, giving it a valuation of roughly $60 billion, according to China Business News, a respected daily newspaper that is part-owned by Alibaba. The new investors include high-profile state-owned Chinese corporations such as a unit of China Investment Corp. (CIC), the country’s sovereign wealth fund and a subsidiary of China Construction Bank, the country’s second-largest lender by assets.

“We hope to bring more transparency to charity and blockchain technology’s decentralized nature fits that purpose well,” said Ant Financial CTO Cheng Li. “It means that all the information and transaction history of funds will be more reliable and can’t be easily tampered with.”

The China Social Assistance Foundation is one of the first large Chinese charities to join the project.

Cheng explained that donors on “Ant Love” — the charity platform operated by the company — will be able to track transaction histories and gain a clearer understanding of where their funds go and how they’re used. According to the Ant Financial executive, that makes it tougher to alter records and may help restore some of the trust that’s been squandered over the years. In fact, though philanthropy is growing fast in China, numerous scandals have undermined the donors’ confidence and trust.

Cheng added that Ant Financial is using a private blockchain for the project and plans to open up the ledger to charity organizations and auditors in the future. It seems plausible that Ant Financial has chosen philanthropy, a non-controversial and socially important application, for its first projects with distributed ledger technology before moving on to business-relevant and potentially very profitable applications such as payments and remittances.

In this case, Ant Financial — a fast-growing subsidiary of one of the world’s largest tech giants, expected to become a high-profile public corporation itself — would give a significant boost to the distributed ledgers in the mainstream business world.

BitGive Foundation’s Ongoing Charity 2.0 Initiative: Donation Transparency Platform on the Bitcoin Blockchain

Ant Financial is not the first to try to improve transparency in charitable giving. The BitGive Foundation, a U.S. 501(c)(3) nonprofit whose mission is to “revolutionize global philanthropy through technology,” announced BitGive’s Charity 2.0 Initiative: Donation Transparency Platform for donors and nonprofits using Bitcoin's blockchain technology in 2015.

“It is interesting and exciting to see entities like Ant Financial and Jack Ma’s Alibaba Group looking at blockchain technology,”  BitGive Founder and Executive Director Connie Gallippi said to Bitcoin Magazine. “Their desire to develop a charity project focused on transparency is certainly great testament to BitGive’s Charity 2.0 Initiative: Donation Transparency Platform, which we have been developing for over a year. BitGive’s platform has been widely supported by the Bitcoin and Blockchain community and has received grants and other financial support from philanthropic entities, including the Walter and Karla Goldschmidt Foundation.”

According to the BitGive website, the new platform will revolutionize philanthropy by allowing donors and the public to trace nonprofit transactions on a public platform in real time, to track the funds until they reach their final destination and to see how the donations are spent. BitGive’s platform also has a donor-experience focus that ties donor contributions to direct results on the ground so donors will not only know how and where their donation funds were spent, they will also see the impact and results first-hand from their contributions.

Gallippi also noted that a key distinguishing principle for BitGive’s Donation Transparency Platform is that it is built on the public and widely-accepted Bitcoin blockchain, rather than on a private blockchain, “providing true public transparency and accountability on an immutable ledger that is housed on a distributed global infrastructure.”

BitGive’s MVP (minimum viable product) will be released within the next month or so, says Gallippi, showcasing charity partners who have elected to be demonstration use cases, including those using cross-border transactions for projects in developing countries. The platform will also incorporate administrative and data analysis features for charities to use in reporting and auditing. ",Law & Justice,0.4019
2016/8/5,"Ross Ulbricht Defense Files Reply in Court Appeal, Disputes Fairness of Trial","Ross Ulbricht’s legal defense filed a reply to the government as part of his appeal this week. On behalf of Ulbricht, who was sentenced to double life in prison without parole for operating the Silk Road dark marketplace under the alias Dread Pirate Roberts (DPR) more than a year ago, attorney Joshua Dratel disputes the fairness of the trial. The defense has requested that Ulbricht’s “convictions should be vacated, and a new trial ordered, or that he be re-sentenced before a different district judge.”

Ulbricht's defense had issued an initial appeal earlier this year, which was answered by state prosecutors in late May. This week, the defense responded to these answers in a brief submitted to the appellate court, hoping to prove — most importantly — that Ulbricht's Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated.

To learn more about the appeal, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Ulbricht's mother, Lyn Ulbricht, who's been fighting for her son's rights ever since he was arrested in October of 2013.

Right to a Fair Trial

The overriding issue in the appeal is Ulbricht's right to a fair trial and right to present a defense, as established by the Fifth and Sixth amendments to the United States Constitution. Ulbricht's defense maintains that these rights were denied to Ulbricht. Most importantly — but not exclusively — as evidence pertaining to corrupt agents involved in the case was not allowed to be brought forth in court.

This evidence, most importantly concerns special agents Carl Mark Force IV and Shawn Bridges, both of whom confessed to corruption and are currently serving time in prison. State prosecutors were aware of both these cases at the time of Ulbricht's trial. One of them was also known to the Ulbricht defense at the time, while the other was not — a deliberate non-disclosure, according to Ulbricht's defense.

As such, the court denied Ulbricht's defense the opportunity to inform the jury about both corrupt agents along with all related information potentially relevant to the case, which Ulbricht’s defense maintains is illegal as per the Brady Rule.

Lyn Ulbricht explained:

“A person in trial has to be convicted beyond a reasonable doubt. If this evidence was allowed to be presented, it's a question in my mind whether the jury wouldn't have had some doubt about Ross's role. Ross's lawyer thought to have one of the corrupt agents in the trial but the government said that would jeopardize their investigation into this corruption and claimed it's a separate case that has nothing to do with Ross. However, going through the documentation, Ross himself found that he was effectively arrested by [Special Agent] Force; Force was very much involved with the investigation. Of course, that information would have been very relevant.”

The information pertaining to the corrupt agents is not the only information that was withheld from the jury. Most importantly, Ulbricht's defense maintains that while Ulbricht did establish the website, he did not operate it for most of its existence; rather, there were several DPRs. In a bombshell revelation at the time of the trial, it was revealed that state prosecutors suspected at least one other high-profile name to operate under the alias: former Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles. Although questioning regarding the potential involvement of Karpeles was initially allowed in court, it was deemed irrelevant by the sitting judge later on in the trial.

Fourth Amendment Violation

Ulbricht's defense also argues that his Fourth Amendment rights were breached, claiming state agencies did not have the proper warrants to investigate Ulbricht in the manner that they did.

The most important breach, according to the defense, regards Ulbricht's digital property rights. Prosecutors used general warrants to search through Ulbricht's entire laptop as well as Facebook and Google accounts. The legality of this practice is questionable, as it lacked particularity and has, therefore even drawn attention from civil rights groups.

“The National Association for Criminal Defense Lawyers and the EFF [Electronic Frontier Foundation] both have joined the brief, saying these warrants were illegal,” Lyn Ulbricht explained. “General warrants mean that the government can go through your home, from attic to basement, looking for whatever they can find; rummaging around. In this case they rummaged around Ross's digital house. But the Fourth Amendment requires particularity. It requires these agents to say exactly what they're looking for.”

There is also a question regarding validity of digital evidence in itself, which includes most of the evidence that was used to convict Ulbricht. Since the corrupt agents had log-in credentials and access to many parts of the Silk Road backend, chat logs and other material may have easily been fabricated or edited, the defense claims. This is especially relevant since it's clear now that Bridges, in particular, took deliberate affirmative steps to deflect blame from himself onto others.

State agents also applied advanced techniques to wiretap and geolocate Ulbricht in order to arrest him. Much like applying these techniques to mobile phones, the defense argues this was unlawful, too, without very specific and required warrants.

Unreasonable Sentencing

As another key main point, Ulbricht's defense argues that the sentencing was “shockingly high” and exceeds the bounds of reasonableness. The double life sentence Ulbricht is currently serving, his lawyer points out, “dwarfs the sentences imposed on other key players” and “far exceeds even the sentence requested by the government.”

Ulbricht's defense specifically argues that the basis on which he received the severe sentencing was shoehorned in by the judge, particularly as it relies on a couple of drug overdose-related deaths. According to experts, however, it cannot be established that these overdoses were caused by drugs purchased on the Silk Road website at all.

According to Lyn Ulbricht:

“At the trial there were six overdose stats; claims that people died from drugs they bought on Silk Road. A 30-year experienced pathologist said there's no way you can say these drugs came from Silk Road. Yet the judge relied on this for her sentencing, basically creating her own legal standards.”

Additionally, the judge set out to make an example of Ulbricht, which has no basis in law. Such a deterrence penalty, moreover, has proved to be altogether ineffective, as dark net markets have only grown in number, size and scope since Ulbricht's conviction.

Likewise, the judge took into account an alleged murder-for-hire plot, supposedly paid for by Ulbricht to protect Silk Road customer identities. These murders, however, were not only never actually carried out, they were not part of the case against Ulbricht. As such, his defense maintains that these murders-for-hire remain unproven in the court of law and should not weigh into the sentencing.

Furthermore, the defense claims that Ulbricht's heavy sentencing was ultimately the result on the judge's assessment that Ulbricht would pose a risk to society if he ever got out of prison. This assessment is completely unwarranted, Lyn Ulbricht believes.

“With this sentence, there's a precedent set for a non-violent person, who's a first offender, with no evidence at all that he is a danger to anyone — certainly after the mandatory memo of 20 years that he would come out at the age of 50, with no internet access and be a danger on the internet,” she said. “And he's certainly been shown not to be any sort of danger off the internet … it's so over the top. They made it clear they were just using him to set an example.

“Some people think Ross is a villain. Some people think Ross is a hero. Some people have never even heard of him,” Ulbricht’s mother said. “But whatever you think, or believe of the government's 'evidence,’ it should concern all Americans that a fair trial is something that needs to be protected and defended. Every trial that is unfair and that is allowed to stand, I personally believe, takes us one step closer to tyranny.”

It is now up to an appellate court to decide whether there should be a reversal of the trial. Appellate courts do not re-hear the case itself but rather focus on questions of law and if it was upheld and applied correctly.

2016/8/22,Strategic Alliance Formed to Speed Up Adoption of Blockchain Technology in China,"The Chinese government has created a blockchain working group of government and blockchain industries to fast-forward the development and adoption of blockchain technology and prepare for the upcoming Global Blockchain Summit in Shanghai this September.

The three-way strategic alliance among the Chinese government, ChinaLedger and the Shenzhen Consortium forms an unprecedented organized force, mandated to grow China’s blockchain industry and propel it forward on a global level. Wanxiang Blockchain Labs, Ant Financial, Webank, Universal Holdings, Ping An Insurance and Micro Focus Bank are among the companies involved.

In an official press release, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology Software Services Division Director Xie Shaofeng speaks for the government, saying that the world is in a new “technological revolution” and blockchain technology and “its application has universal significance in promoting economic and social development.” He calls on all players in government and industry to “pool the wisdom of collaborative innovation.”

The working group will identify significant trends both in China and abroad, decide which key technologies and applications should be developed, identify cyber-security concerns and look at possible government regulations and standard-setting for the blockchain industry.

In an effort to organize research on the “developing trend of blockchain technology and its application,” the Department of Information and Software Service, an agency of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, has issued a letter delegating the task to the China Electronics Standardization Institute, an agency of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.

Yu Du, the director of Wanxiang Blockchain Labs, a nonprofit research institute, told Bitcoin Magazine:

“The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology is the government authority for developing standards and rules of China industry and information fields. Joining it enables enterprises to engage in blockchain standardization in the early days. In particular, Wanxiang Group as the Vice-Director Unit will have an important propelling and coordinating role. And as a conglomerate, it can promote blockchain in financial sectors and non-financial sectors through its experience and advantages in auto parts and whole vehicle.”

At the working group’s inaugural meeting, Ant Financial’s chief architect, Tong Ling, told the group that what’s good for business and the Chinese economy can also serve as a public service and improve China’s standard of living, but there needs to be room for business to innovate without undue restriction.

Universal Holdings Vice Chairman Xiao Feng noted the importance of building on the work already completed by ChinaLedger and called on the working group to ensure all relevant sectors of Chinese society are involved, as well as calling on the international community to participate.

Xie Shaofeng stressed the importance of cloud computing and big data powered by the blockchain, telling the group that new information technology “will bring about revolutionary change” to Chinese society.

A committee of the working group, the White Paper Writing Group, will work under the guidance of relevant government departments, bringing together a wide range of domestic and international “high-end wisdom” to develop a comprehensive plan to develop the blockchain industry.

The working group’s first priority is to prepare a proposed development plan to be presented to delegates from around the world attending the six-day summit in Shanghai from September 19-24, 2016.

The event will build on the first Global Blockchain Summit in October 2015 and is co-hosted by Wanxiang Blockchain Labs and Ethereum’s DevCon, making it “one of the most anticipated industry events to date,” according to the Ethereum Foundation’s Executive Director Ming Chan.

Chan notes that Shanghai is “both a global financial hub and home to many of Asia’s blockchain pioneers, where the blockchain community continues to grow,” making it an ideal location for the event.

A confirmed list of over forty speakers at the conference includes representatives from Microsoft, UBS, Santander and Ernst & Young, as well as blockchain experts from Ethereum, HyperLedger, R3, Ethcore, Circle, ConsenSys, OpenBazaar and Zcash.

China’s Growing Love Affair With the Blockchain

Until recently, the Chinese government had mostly taken a wait-and-see attitude toward blockchain and digital currencies.

Now the People's Bank of China (PBOC) is experimenting with blockchain technology and a possible digital currency of its own. Furthermore, China’s government recently signaled that it is warming up to blockchain and digital technologies with a newly proposed civil law that will recognize people’s legal right to own virtual assets, including digital currencies.

Wanxiang Blockchain Labs was instrumental in the creation of ChinaLedger, an alliance of regional commodity exchanges, equity exchanges and financial asset exchanges with the aim of creating “an open source blockchain protocol that developers can further build upon in the future.”  

Among the alliance’s advisors from the blockchain community are Jeff Garzik of Bloq, Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, Tim Swanson from R3 and Anthony Di Iorio, co-founder of Ethereum and CEO of Decentral.",Law & Justice,0.9948

         China's BitKan Eyes American Expansion
        
Four months after launching over-the-counter (OTC) trading, and fueled with US$1.6 million in funding from bitcoin mining giant, Bitmain, BitKan is looking to kick off its expansion plans starting with the U.S.

""The U.S. is a large and special market target, so we are doing a lot of preparations focusing on law and localization in these three months,"" BitKan CEO Liu Yang told Bitcoin Magazine. ""We plan to start all-sided layout in America in September.""

Shenzhen-based BitKan offers Bitcoin-related tools and services such as aggregated news, mining monitoring and price alerts. In April, it raised US$1.6 million in a Series A funding round from Bitmain, one of the world's largest manufacturers of bitcoin mining hardware.

OTC trading was introduced in May as a solution for peer-to-peer trading. According to Ruby Chan, BitKan's marketing director, the app has grown in popularity, especially over the past two years. The company now serves some ""millions of users in total and over one hundred thousand registered users.""

In July, the company triggered its global expansion plans, starting with releasing OTC trading functions for overseas markets on its mobile apps. When asked which markets have seen the most notable growth, Yang said that it is still too early to tell, although ""we could foresee that Russia is really a large market.""

BitKan is now working toward developing its current businesses, including OTC trading and polishing its apps ""to offer the perfect service to our users,"" Yang said. The company plans to launch a brand new, re-designed website. Next week, it will kick off its BitKan OTC Referral Program which will allow registered users to earn bitcoins by referring friends to the trading service.

The next steps for BitKan will include promoting its products in international markets and ""[trying] to find the right shoe on the global stage,"" Yang said.

The company is also exploring the ""strategic layout for Bitcoin applications"" as well as other possible use cases for the technology. Yang named international payments and micropayments as being two areas ""where bitcoin could play a tremendous role.""

China and the U.S. — Two Potential Leaders in Digital Currencies

China, the world's largest population and the second largest economy, is already a big player in the Bitcoin space. Although bitcoin mining and market speculation still remain the main focus when it comes to Bitcoin in China, the industry is maturing and ""China will become more open and more practical,"" said Yang.

This year, Chinese corporations and banks have been expressing increasing interest in blockchain technology. In May, Shanghai-based nonprofit research institution, Wanxiang Blockchain Labs, announced a new consortium called the ChinaLedger Alliance. The coalition, consisting of 11 regional financial institutions, aims at creating ""an open source blockchain protocol that developers can further build upon in the future.""

This was followed by the establishment of a new blockchain working group in August, a three-way strategic alliance among the government, ChinaLedger and the Shenzhen Consortium, seeking to ""pool the wisdom of collaborative innovation"" to harness blockchain potential and gear up for what could well be the next ""technological revolution,"" according to Ministry of Industry and Information Technology Software Services Division Director Xie Shaofeng.

""In the industry of blockchain in China, the research [is] in full swing,"" Yang said. ""Although there are still certain bubbles, all will come out in the wash. Excellent companies and products will emerge after the bubble bursts...It can be predicted that China and America will be two main characters on the stage of cryptocurrency in the near future.""",Law & Justice,0.9911

         Op-Ed: Blockchain Can Make Globalization Work
        
De-globalization is not just about Brexit and rising U.S. protectionism. It is much more than that. It's a pervasive negative attitude regarding globalization that includes various autonomous and sometimes antagonistic movements, such as anti-Western universalism in Eurasia, anti-federalism in Eastern Europe, Piketty-type neo-Marxism in Western Europe, as well as the Islamic State and the like from the Mediterranean to Central Asia.

What's at stake here is the post World War II intellectual construct positing that if people from all civilizations find it profitable to be acquainted through exchange, they will become interdependent and identify with mankind as a whole, peacefully.

Globalization is losing ground fast to de-globalization — the view that a globalized economy generates intolerable inequalities between people, classes, nations and civilizations. To combat inequality, the argument goes, governments need to regain their sovereign rights and close their national borders.

Inequality within societies has widened considerably in recent decades. But this is not because of international trade or movements of people; after all, cross-border trade and migration have been happening for thousands of years. So what is fueling it? To answer that question, we must consider what it is about globalization that is generating returns for the wealthy. The reply: the capacity to combine.

A central aspect of globalization is the careful documentation of the knowledge and legal tools needed to combine sovereign rights and property rights over seemingly useless single assets (electronic parts, legal rights to production, and so on) into complex wholes (an iPhone), and appropriate the surplus value they generate.

It is well-organized knowledge documented in clear and accessible ledgers that faithfully describes not only who controls what and where, but also the rules governing potential combinations, which makes it possible for the multiple components from ten countries to be brought together to manufacture one wooden pencil in Germany; it is also the story behind the hundreds of combinations that are required to assemble a mechanical Swiss watch and the thousands that it took to create flight navigation systems in the U.S. or over the world wide internet.

It is also the knowledge that informs us which authority has the sovereign right to regulate exchange, who has the property rights to any given asset and who can use both of these rights to leverage that asset. That is also how we know what can be leveraged and whether a given document can be used to perform over a dozen functions that are required to make complex combinations, including those acting as pledges against investment, collateral for credit, credentials for receiving public services and property rights containers to capture and store the surplus value created by the combinations.

After two decades of fieldwork in some 20 countries with over 1,000 researchers, my organization, the Institute for Liberty and Democracy (ILD), has ascertained that 5 billion people — out of 7.3 billion around the world — are not documented in national ledgers or in anything approaching a manner easy to compare, measure or mix on an international scale. Instead, their entrepreneurial talents and legal rights to assets are recorded in hundreds of scattered records and rules systems throughout their countries, making them internationally inaccessible.

The Missing Links in the Legal Chain and Blockchain

This lack of consolidated, documented knowledge — and not trade — is the principal reason for global inequality. The lawyers and politicians who draft and enact the legislation and regulations that govern globalization are dramatically disconnected from those who are supposed to implement the policies at the local level, and those who write up and control the ledgers that embody the social contracts that are respected on the ground. In other words, the legal chain is missing a few crucial links.

Experience in Japan, the United States and Europe shows that putting in place a straightforward legal approach to ensuring equal rights and opportunities can take a century or more. But there is a faster way: treating the missing links as a break not in a legal chain, but in a knowledge chain.

We at the ILD know something about knowledge chains. We spent 15 years adding millions of people to the globalized legal system by bringing the knowledge contained in marginal ledgers into the legal mainstream — all without the help of sophisticated software. But we do not have decades more to spend on this process; we need to bring in billions more people, and fast, if we want globalization to be less unequal. That will require automation.

Over a year ago, the ILD began — with seed funding from the Omidyar Network and the brilliant and patient coaching of Bill Tai from Silicon Valley — to determine whether information technology, and specifically blockchain (the transparent, secure, and decentralized online ledger that underpins Bitcoin), could enable more of the world's population to get in on globalization. The answer is a resounding yes.

By translating the language of the legal chain into a digital language — an achievement that required us to develop a set of 21 typologies — we have created a system that could do at least four important things:

First, identify, locate and capture any ledger in the world and make it public;

Second, make compliance effective by digitally placing any international contract in the ledgers — local or global — where the reputation of the contracting parties is at stake and commitment is more likely;

Third, we have been able to compress into 34 binary indicators the questions that computers have to ask captured ledgers to determine which provisions should be made in existing legislation to make globalization a more equal process;

And, fourth, use those same 34 indicators to insert into ""blockchain smart contracts"" the links missing in the legal chain, so that globalized firms and non-globalized collectives can start making fair deals without needing to wait for local rules to adapt to global legislation.

Maybe the language that will help us globalize in equal terms is not English but the binary language of automation.

2016/10/5,European Parliament Document Suggests Future of Democracy Linked to Blockchain-Enabled E-Voting,"Regardless of one’s opinions about the outcome, the recent Brexit referendum in the U.K. should be considered a welcome example of direct democracy. In fact, letting the citizens express their preference on important issues, bypassing the intermediation of politicians, is often desirable.

Why, then, isn’t direct democracy used more often? One reason is that it costs money to organize and run elections. Another is that voting is still a 20th century (or 19th century) process that requires physically going to a place, or in the best cases, sending paper documents via snail mail. Therefore, voting is often too much of a hassle for 21st century citizens, who are now used to doing most things online, without leaving home.

On October 2, the citizens of Hungary were called to a referendum to choose whether or not to accept refugee quotas imposed by the European Union. While the issue has raised and continues to raise impassioned debates in Hungary (and other European countries,) less than half of the population voted. That was partly due to the fact that minority opposition parties told their supporters to stay home, in order to invalidate the results of a referendum they couldn’t win. But another reason is that many voters couldn’t be bothered.

Typically, only half or fewer than half of eligible voters vote in a referendum, which, together with the costs, makes direct democracy impractical. The average participation in administrative and political elections isn’t much higher. It seems clear that the world needs electronic voting (e-voting). Ideally, we should vote online, just as we do e-banking from home.

“Since the turn of the century, e-voting has been considered a promising and (eventually) inevitable development, which could speed up, simplify and reduce the cost of elections, and might even lead to higher voter turnouts and the development of stronger democracies,” notes a recent European Parliament document titled “What if blockchain technology revolutionised voting?” The document is one of the “What if…” essays in the Think Tank section of the European Parliament website, dedicated to “documents that help shape new EU legislation.”

The author, Philip Boucher, is a member of the Scientific Foresight services in the Science and Technology Options Assessment (STOA) team of the European Parliament. According to Boucher, we have two choices: “to continue trusting central authorities to manage elections, or to use blockchain technology to distribute an open voting record among citizens.”

Security is an open and challenging issue for e-voting. Of course, other aspects of “e-life,” such as e-banking, present important security concerns as well. In e-banking, appropriately high security is typically achieved through multi-factor authentication, and some high-security applications use biometrics as well. One difference is that society is supposed to guarantee easy access to voting to everyone, regardless of income or education. Therefore, it seems likely that blockchain enabled e-voting will be deployed in private organizations first.

“Usually, votes are recorded, managed, counted and checked by a central authority,” notes Boucher. “Blockchain-enabled e-voting (BEV) would empower voters to do these tasks themselves, by allowing them to hold a copy of the voting record.”

A possible approach to BEV is to create new blockchains tailored to e-voting, and perhaps even to specific elections and demographics. Similar approaches are often preferred by regulators and bureaucrats, but Boucher is more bold and creative. “A second approach that may be cheaper and easier is to ‘piggyback’ running the election on a more established blockchain, such as that used by the virtual currency, bitcoin,” says Boucher. “Given that the security of a blockchain ledger relies upon the breadth of its user base, this piggyback approach may also be more secure for elections with a small number of voters.” It’s interesting to note the similarity of this argument with those put forward by cryptographer Nick Szabo in favor of the open, permissionless Bitcoin blockchain.

It seems evident that BEV would be cheaper than the current voting system. But one of the sources cited by Boucher is skeptical about the other advantage of e-voting mentioned above — that e-voting would boost turnout. In fact, the younger “digital natives” who would find BEV natural and easy are, according to surveys, not very interested in voting.

There could be other political advantages of BEV though. “The debate is whether blockchain will represent a transformative or merely incremental development, and what its implications could be for the future of democracy,” notes Boucher. “BEV would shift power and trust away from central actors, such as electoral authorities, and foster the development of a tech-enabled community consensus.”

One of the references given by Boucher is a Bitcoin Magazine interview with Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, the founder and CEO of Bitnation, a blockchain-based “Governance 2.0” initiative, with a collaborative platform for DIY governance. “We believe we’ll make both nation states governments, as well as organizations like the U.N. irrelevant, simply through providing cheaper, more secure and better Do-It-Yourself governance services,” said Tarkowski Tempelhof in another Bitcoin Magazine interview.

Boucher, an officer of a European organization, would probably question the desirability of the outcome advocated by Tarkowski Tempelhof. But the fact remains that some of the considerations in the European Parliament paper suggest decentralized politics is a desirable outcome. This is, to say the least, refreshing.

“[BEV] is managed by the people and it is transparent, decentralized and bottom-up,” explains Boucher. “While participation in traditional elections reinforces the authority of the state, participation in BEV asserts the primacy of the people. In this light, it is not surprising that links are drawn between BEV and transitions towards a more direct, decentralized and bottom-up democracy.”",Law & Justice,0.9973
2016/10/12,"Op-Ed: Trump vs. Clinton: On Debt, Taxes and Bitcoin, Expect the Same...But Different","What would the impact be of a Trump or Clinton presidency on digital currencies? Politics, banking, and money are all related. Major changes in a country’s governance will have huge implications for monetary policy.

Trump

Trump is the King of Debt. He is no stranger to bankruptcy and financial leverage. His presidency would put America First, jeopardizing trade deals. He is attempting to pitch himself as a 21st century Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Roosevelt is famous for the New Deal, which involved massive infrastructure spending. While FDR is credited by many for lifting America out of the Great Depression, in reality it is much easier to rebuild your economy when your trading partners are being Blitzkrieged.

During the recent debates, Trump promised to upgrade the America’s airports, roads, bridges — and walls. That costs a lot of money. Where will this money come from? Most likely Trump will engage in massive government spending and borrowing.

In the same debate, Trump voiced concerns that the Fed has not raised interest rates. He implied that the Fed has kept rates too low for too long, and that as a result a day of reckoning will occur. If Trump is to begin a massive round of infrastructure spending, he surely doesn’t want to be doing that when the 30 year US Treasury bond yields north of 5%.

The King of Debt will want the cheapest borrowing costs possible. Which means a continuation of easy monetary policies from the Fed.

Clinton

Hillary Clinton promises more of the same. She has been wheeling and dealing in the beltway since the 1970s. Her pitch is a continuation of the policies of the past eight years. She even served as Secretary of State under Obama for a portion of that time.

More of the same means more government spending. More taxes and more goodies for everyone, both rich and poor. Contrary to the image she tries to project of a down-to-earth good ole gal, Clinton is quite comfortable eating at Dorsia with Oliver Peoples-wearing “Finānciers.”

The financial institutions are big supporters of Clinton, and she will not disappoint them; her husband didn’t, and neither will she. Massive government spending for the poor and middle class, and massive monetary printing for the moneyed elites. That is what will be on order with Clinton.

Similar to a Trump presidency, government spending will accelerate. The Fed will need keep the printing presses humming to accommodate the fiscal spending.

Same Same But Different

The Devil you know (Clinton) and the Devil you don’t (Trump) both promise to increase government spending. These bonds will be monetised by the Fed lest interest rates spike higher. The Fed will actually welcome an increased supply of government bonds to buy. As it stands, the US government is not spending enough to accommodate the Fed’s appetite for debt securities.

Central banks around the world have lamented the lack of fiscal spending. They believe that monetary policy cannot be the sole answer to economic problems. Governments need to pick up the slack. They need to engage in spending and enact policies to resolve structural economic issues.

The issuance of U.S. Treasuries has slowed. While the U.S. government runs persistent deficits, they are getting smaller. The pool of eligible bonds the Fed can buy is shrinking. That is partly why they were forced to suspend QE purchases. They faced the risk of completely owning the bond market. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) 30-year saga to end deflation resulted in the death of the Japanese Government Bond (JGB) market.

The BOJ owns so much of the supply, the market has ceased to function. The JGB market is now a ghost town. The Fed will be very happy that both presidential candidates advocate increased government spending. They desperately want to restart QE, and a President Trump or President Clinton will enable that.

For bitcoin and other digital currencies this trend is positive. The inflation brought upon by increased Fed largesse will continue to bleed into assets free from central bank manipulation.

Real estate and gold are the traditional assets savers flee to in times of inflation. The problem is that these assets are not portable and are subject to ex-post taxation. What better way to tax the rich than to raise property taxes and gold transaction taxes?

The appeal of Bitcoin is that, whether you own $1 or $1 billion worth, it costs nothing to store, it can be accessed anywhere via an internet connection, and it is unlikely to be the (successful) target of a tax grab.

2016/11/4,Op-Ed: How Blockchain Technology Can Revolutionize E-Democracy,"Our democratic systems of today were designed hundreds of years ago, in a time when letters were drafted in quill and ink, and then sent hundreds of miles over horseback to be shared between individuals. Governing institutions required closed-door offices in order to handle and organize the massive number of documents required by their agencies. This data module made sense because it was the most efficient option afforded to that particular era.

With the advent of the internet, the ability to share information has changed so fundamentally that it is hardly comparable to the methods used during the eighteenth century. This decisive evolution of human communications has begun to shape our conception of government as well. E-democracy, also known as digital democracy, is the term drafted to describe the influence that communication technologies are having on democratic governments. Some examples of digital democracy are electronic voting and online government services.

However, the model of governance we use today is still all too similar to the ones used hundreds of years ago. Though information has gone from a written substrate to a digital one, and the speed at which information is shared has increased exponentially, the general relationship between the government and the public is the same. Information is stored in centralized databases that citizens can query for information. A trust relationship between citizenry and the government exists at the core of this model, as it did hundreds of years ago. Blockchain technology finally introduces the ability to replace trust in government offices with trust in a protocol based upon the impartiality of mathematics and cryptography. The immediate benefits of using distributed, and not centralized, systems in government are efficiency, integrity and security; the long term benefits are a more involved and empowered citizenry.

Blockchain technologies stem from the digital currency bitcoin, which was originally designed to cut out middleman financial institutions (banks and credit companies) charged with maintaining financial transaction ledgers. Blockchains natural environment is financial, which is why blockchain tech’s largest impacts are within the financial world. The Bank of England has even dubbed blockchain technology to potentially be the “internet of finance.”

Though the majority of new financial blockchain projects are being led for private sector businesses, public sector finance is also beginning to experience ripples of the blockchain revolution. For example, the U.K. Department for Work and Pensions is trialing blockchain tech for use in tracking and distributing welfare and pensions. Another project in the Republic of Georgia is piloting a blockchain-based land registry. Chief executive Valery Vavilov of BitFury, the company heading the project, explains the concept as an incorruptible yet transparent notary service that would allow for real-time audits “not once per year, but every 10 minutes.”

These exact characteristics could potentially advance the realm of taxes as well, which is why U.K.-based organization DigitalCatapult, a catapult center meant to innovate the digital economy, is entertaining discussions on the topic. Moving tax information and accounting records onto a public blockchain system would inherently provide “more useful information and more certainty” to everyone with a stake in a nation — not just tax agencies, but also citizens, business tycoons and government officials alike. By storing a nation’s wealth on a public blockchain, real-time data could be used to increase organizational efficiency and cut down on waste within large organizations (which governments are) where inefficiency and disarray are endemic.

Opacity within government fiscal policy also distances the citizenry, discouraging citizens from researching matters and forming opinions. The increased visibility and inherently uncompromising transparency of blockchain-based systems would help make government budgets and spending more clear, thus lessening the barrier between government and the citizenry, and ultimately encouraging more involvement in democratic processes.

The characteristics which make blockchain technology incredibly valuable extend beyond the realm of finances and the tracking of assets. For example, democratic countries could benefit by using the ability to track transfers of value on a public yet incorruptible ledger system to fundamentally change election processes.

Currently, democratic countries around the globe use implementations of the secret ballot system. Despite small nuances of difference in the electoral processes of the world’s diverse democratic countries, the fundamental concept is universally the same: voters go to polling stations and cast anonymous paper ballots into a ballot box. The votes are later counted and added to the final tally of votes from different polling stations around the nation.

Though different forms of electronic voting are used around the world, the functions and results are nearly identical, albeit simply more efficient, than physical ballot voting. Ballots go into a black box, and election results come out. This method has advantages, but it has drawbacks as well. This system is based on a trust relationship with the third party or government collecting and counting ballots, meaning common citizens have absolutely no way to guarantee that their votes were counted correctly, or that no election fraud was carried out behind the scenes. It’s no wonder voters have little faith in the system and that countries suffer from low voter turnout and a politically apathetic populace.  

Blockchain solutions for the problem of centralized elections have been proposed by the Follow My Vote project, which has designed open source election software based on blockchain technology. The system would represent transfers of value on the blockchain not as currency, but as a voter’s ballot. The transparency of the system would not only allow voters to verify that their individual votes were counted correctly, but also allow citizens to conduct an independent “audit [of] the ballot box” by scanning the blockchain where all votes are cast. The system would also sport strong security against both external cyber attacks and internal election fraud through the immutable and distributed ledger.

Finally, the concept of DAOs brought to us by digital currencies has allowed us to reimagine the way we organize ourselves. A DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a distributed organization governed by distributed consensus and “smart contracts” — essentially programming logic executing and enforcing rules depending on the fulfillment of conditions. The first DAO was Bitcoin, “governed by consensus among its core team and its mining network,” with other DAOs now being launched over Ethereum to govern real-world businesses. Smart contracts essentially govern the DAO, with stakeholders democratically voting on issues across the decentralized blockchain network. The concept of the DAO has allowed us to reimagine human organizations, bringing what Ethereum calls “democracy on the blockchain.”

When our democratic governments were originally created, the ability to communicate instantaneously with the entire world was an unimaginable fantasy. So our predecessors designed systems of representative government, which were the most efficient solution to the problem of representing millions of people in the human organization that is a nation. However, as technology changes, so do our societies. Just as society was fundamentally changed by electricity and the printing press, so too could the combined inventions of the internet and the blockchain fundamentally change our modern society and democratic institutions.

Perhaps, someday in the future, our centralized parliaments and representative institutions will be replaced with a concept similar to a DAO, so that all citizens with a stake in the nation will be empowered with objectively equal political power. Armed with the power of distributed communication technologies and governed by consensus on a blockchain, our descendants could directly represent themselves with their own voices in the purest form of democracy ever attained — a distributed, digital democracy.",Law & Justice,0.9977
2016/11/7,Chinese Investors Turn to Bitcoin Amid Yuan Depreciation,"The continuous devaluation of the Yuan has increased demand for bitcoin and new asset classes in China. Today, the country counts some 2 million bitcoin users; among them, 80 percent are speculating for short-term profit and about 14 percent are holding long-term, recognizing the value of the digital currency, according to Fang Yu, COO and Co-Founder of BitKan.

Speaking at the laBITconf conference in Buenos Aires earlier this week, Yu pointed out China's appetite for bitcoin and other digital currencies and noted the craze for blockchain technology within both the private and public sectors.  

""Big banks and financial institutions, even the government, are taking part in the research of [blockchain technology],"" Yu told the audience. ""They all consider [the blockchain] as a big chance for disruption. Even some banks have already set up their in-house research department for this.""

In October, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued a whitepaper that explored various applications of blockchain and advocated the development of China's blockchain industry.

The release coincided with a forum on blockchain hosted by the government aimed at encouraging cooperation among industry stakeholders.

Blockchain initiatives have multiplied in recent months with the launch of the ChinaLedger Alliance and a three-way strategic coalition between the Chinese government, ChinaLedger and the Shenzhen Consortium earlier this year.

During International Blockchain Week in Shanghai this September, enterprise blockchain platform developer BlockApps signed key partnerships in China: with Minsheng Life Insurance for an employee appreciation pilot program, as well as pilot production systems for Wanxiang Smart City and Qianhai Smart City.

""Since the beginning of the year, blockchain has become a hot topic in China,"" Yu said. ""More Bitcoin companies 'transformed' and set up tech companies around blockchain technology. The bitcoin price surge this year is an indication of the new value in the industry.

""The heat is not only at home. We see China taking three seats in the global top 10 blockchain VCs, though the companies they are investing in are mostly overseas.""

Wanxiang Blockchain Labs, the Chinese auto giant’s blockchain research institution, is dedicating a $50 million fund to blockchain technology; ShuBei Ventures, the biggest blockchain investment fund in the world, has already invested 180 million RMB (US$26.6 million) of its 600 million RMB (US$88.8 million) fund; and IDG Ventures has invested in the likes of Ripple, Coinbase, Circle and Koinify.

Back in December 2013, the Chinese government's decision to not consider bitcoin as a legal tender caused the closure of a number of bitcoin-related payment businesses, leading to what Yu refers to as ""the Bitcoin winter in China.""

A new civil law proposed in June 2016, suggests that China has drifted away from its wait-and-see approach towards bitcoin and digital currencies, unveiling a clear positioning as the government looks to legally consider these as ""virtual commodities"" that people can own and trade freely.

With a massive 700 million internet user pool, a 92 percent smartphone penetration rate and a government supportive to startups, China has been quick to emerge as a leader in bitcoin mining and trading. Today, the country hosts some of the industry's top players — including Bitmain, the world's largest bitcoin-mining machine manufacturer, and top exchange platforms OKCoin and Huobi.

Shenzhen-based BitKan offers Bitcoin-related tools and services such as aggregated news, mining monitoring and price alerts. After raising $1.6 million in a Series A funding round from Bitmain, the company introduced over-the-counter (OTC) trading. BitKan is now exploring other Bitcoin applications, including remittances and micropayments, and plans to expand to the U.S.",Law & Justice,0.9893
2016/11/30,"Hyperledger Project Hits 100 Members With Addition of China's SinoLending, Gingkoo, ZhongChao","Hyperledger Project, an open source blockchain initiative hosted by the Linux Foundation, has hit a major milestone of 100 active members. Several new members from China have joined the project, including Dianrong (formerly SinoLending), Shanghai Gingkoo Financial Technology and ZhongChao Credit Card Industry Development Company.

""As a fintech company, Dianrong has always been at the forefront of applying emerging technologies to finance,"" Peng Bi, Vice President of Engineering, said in a statement. ""While our core business is connecting lenders and borrowers on our peer-to-peer lending platform, blockchain inherently applies to our business model since it can enable anonymous transactions between two unknown parties, solving the trust issue.""

Dianrong is a leading internet financial services company in China, specializing in alternative financing solutions. The company was founded in 2012 by Soul Htite, Co-Founder and former Head of Technology at Lending Club. Dianrong now ranks among the top three peer-to-peer lending platforms in China, according to a report by Wdzj.com and Yingcan Consulting.

Htite has hinted numerous times at his company's interest in blockchain technology, stating earlier this month that Dianrong has been developing blockchain applications for use in online lending. He said that that the company has committed to invest between U.S. $30-40 million in development over the next two years.

According to Bi, alongside peer-to-peer lending, Dianrong is ""also investigating other blockchain applications, such as consumer finance, borrower credit and contract certification.""

As for Ginkgoo, the company is looking ""to explore how to serve banks with distributed ledger technology in China,"" said Bruce Zeng, Manager, Gingkoo Blockchain Department. ""We have developed our own Starfish [blockchain] and established partnerships with many blockchain companies worldwide.""

Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Zeng for further details on the company's Starfish blockchain, but didn't receive a response.

For the ZhongChao organization, joining Hyperledger allows the company to further advance currency digitalization. ""We believe it is the next evolution of financial technology,"" said Yifeng Zhang, President, Zhongchao Smart Card Research Institute. ""We will cooperate with the central bank and financial institutions for further development of the industry.""

As of November 29, the Chamber of Digital Commerce has also entered into a strategic partnership with Hyperledger. This will leverage both the Chamber’s public policy expertise and Hyperledger’s technology expertise to further promote the understanding, acceptance and use of digital assets and blockchain-based technologies. The Chamber and Hyperledger will work in tandem on public policy efforts, intellectual property issues, and global regulatory and technical interoperability.

“A pro-growth perspective towards regulation and industry standards are some of the biggest challenges the open source community faces,” said Perianne Boring, Founder and President of the Chamber of Digital Commerce. “We are excited to work with the technical experts and open source community at the Hyperledger Project to further support our efforts on behalf of the blockchain industry.”

Other members that have recently joined Hyperledger include Beijing Botuzongheng Science & Technology Co. Ltd. and Altoros Americas LLC.

Launched in December 2015, Hyperledger Project is a collaborative cross-industry effort aimed at advancing blockchain technology by creating an open standard for ""a new generation of transactional applications.""

The initiative is supported by prominent players in the technology, finance, banking, Internet of Things, supply chain and manufacturing industries. These include SWIFT, Deutsche Bӧrse Group, DTCC, IBM, R3 and Thomson Reuters, among others.

""The growth and support across the globe is a testament to the need for an open source initiative, like Hyperledger, that accelerates the development of blockchain software and systems to reinvent industries,"" said Brian Behlendorf, Executive Director at Hyperledger.

Among Hyperledger's membership, 41 percent comes from the U.S., followed by China with 25 percent, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) with 20 percent, and Asia-Pacific with 14 percent.

This year, several open source blockchain and distributed ledger projects moved into incubation under Hyperledger — including Hyperledger Fabric, Sawtooth Lake, Blockchain Explorer and Iroha.

In October, Hyperledger launched the Hyperledger Healthcare Working Group to foster conversations and proposals for applications of blockchain technology in the healthcare industry.",Law & Justice,0.9952
2017/12/2,Bitcoin Price Reaches 2-Year High in China; Experts Predict Bull Market Likely to Continue,"The price of bitcoin in China surpassed two-year highs on leading Chinese exchanges today, as Chinese investors continue to seek safe digital havens for their funds.

Last month Bitcoin Magazine reported that the continuous devaluation of the Chinese currency yuan (CNY) was increasing demand for bitcoin in China. The trend was strong enough to be noticed by the mainstream financial press, and The Wall Street Journal ran a story titled “Chinese investors buying up bitcoin as yuan falls.”

Bitcoin Magazine contacted leading Bitcoin operators and exchange CEOs in China to take the pulse of the market in light of this most recent upward price trend.

“It’s very exciting to see bitcoin’s current price rally,” said BTCC CEO Bobby Lee. “It’s about time! We’ve been seeing record trading volumes in China this quarter, as the devaluation of the renminbi continues. I think bitcoin’s price might surpass its 2013 all-time high, as soon as early 2017, reaching or surpassing $1,500.”“Besides the devaluation of the yuan, I think the main reason behind bitcoin’s 80 percent price rise this year is because of major global political and economic upheavals, including Brexit, Trump’s election, turmoil in the banking sector, India’s cancellation of larger-denomination banking notes and Venezuela’s introduction of more stringent capital controls,” Lee told Bitcoin Magazine. “I also think bitcoin’s relative stability and its improvements — such as the implementation of SegWit this year — have made it a safe choice for investors, in comparison with altcoins.”“Looking to the long term, I think bitcoin will reach several thousand U.S. dollars, and might even reach $10,000, before the next block-halving in 2020,” concluded Lee. “This prediction makes sense if you look at how much governments have continued expanding the supply of fiat currencies through printing money and other quantitative easing solutions. Remember: as money supply continues to rapidly increase over time, bitcoin’s price will go up because bitcoin price is measured in units of these inflating currencies.”

“Since the Trump election, the PBOC [People’s Bank of China] has allowed the CNY to weaken within a hair's breath of 7.00 [per US dollar],” said Arthur Hayes, Co-Founder and CEO of BitMEX. “During this recent period of devaluation, Beijing closed one of the most important channels of capital flight, offshore M&A [mergers and acquisitions]. Chinese companies acquiring overseas firms must now get approval from the government.”

Similar to its behavior on other exchanges, the exchange rate of bitcoin at BitMEX is surging noticeably at the time of writing.

“For regular comrades, it is getting harder and harder to escape the weakening CNY,” Hayes told Bitcoin Magazine. “Many tried to escape into the commodity markets after the stock market crashed and property became unaffordable. Beijing is not keen on this rampant speculation and has increased margin requirements, thus causing a collapse in commodity futures trading volumes.”“Bitcoin remains one market where Chinese people can speculate 24/7, and they can convert some wealth into bitcoin as a hedge against a weakening domestic currency,” concluded Hayes. “That is why bitcoin is trading at 2-year highs in China.”

""With the recent blockchain hype decreasing, many startups are turning their eyes on bitcoin,” BitKan CEO Leon Liu told Bitcoin Magazine. “BitKan tx volumes are suggesting that the usage of bitcoin in China and many other emerging markets is growing. Previously, Chinese users are speculation-driven, but number of actual users is increasing fast. Based on the statistics, we are bullish on the bitcoin price.""

According to the data from the domestic trading platform, Huobi.com, December 2 saw a precipitous increase in Bitcoin price. At 10 a.m. in China, bitcoin prices reached their highest level since January of 2014, maxing out at a high of 5497 RMB at 1:56 p.m.

""From a global economic perspective, we are in an era of increasingly uncertain variables,” said Huobi COO Zhu Jiawei. “Bitcoin’s price jumped 21 percent on the day of Brexit. Risk aversion has begun, and outside investment channels are ready.

“From the investment environment in China, RMB depreciation continues, leading to strong demand for hedges,” Jiawei told Bitcoin Magazine. “And with real estate market regulation, people are looking to futures and bitcoin to hedge against RMB depreciation. And for bitcoin itself, awareness this year has increased and investors have paid increasing attention to it as an investment product.”

“The central bank has contributed to popularizing digital currency, hiring new digital currency talent, and announcing that the digital currency initiative of the central bank has completed the two rounds of revision,” concluded Jiawei. “All of this is leading to more people in China seeing the value of bitcoin.""

""In the past two years, the Chinese government has had a relatively loose attitude towards bitcoin,” CHBTC CEO Dawei Li told Bitcoin Magazine. “China's central bank also is actively preparing to issue its digital currency, which is a positive signal for bitcoin companies and investors. The recent devaluations of the CNY has also helped to legitimize bitcoin; this coupled with current macroeconomic crises around the world, we believe, has lead to substantial inflows of capital into bitcoin as it is increasingly seen a safe haven asset in the eyes of local investors.""

GongShi Tan, BTC Media’s Chinese affiliate, touched base with outspoken Chinese bitcoin miner and ltc1btc CEO Zhuo’er Jiang, who said that he sees the price of bitcoin being in a “bull market cycle … especially if we complete a big block expansion, which will lift the limitations of the transactions and active IP addresses. According to Metcalfe's law, the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system. In that case, I think the bitcoin price is very likely to hit twice its highest point, which would be 16,000 RMB.”

“There have been a lot of discussions in the past month on new regulations and attention from the regulators on controlling cross-border capital flow, which is certainly driving a certain amount of interest in bitcoin in China,” said Zennon Kapron, Founder and Director of Kapronasia, a leading financial industry research and consultancy firm specializing in Asian markets. The author of Chomping at the Bitcoin: The Past, Present and Future of Bitcoin in China, Kapron has more than 20 years experience in the finance and technology sectors, working at Citibank and Intel before setting up KapronAsia in 2007.“We are also seeing some of the major blockchain initiatives waiver, like R3, which seems to be losing investors,” Kapron told Bitcoin Magazine. “Although the banks pulling out appear to be either following competition initiatives or starting their own, it could also represent the mood that it indicates a longer-term pivot by the financial industry back to bitcoin.”“A significant amount of money has flowed into other crypto launches, most notably Zcash, which had some tremendous volatility in the month since launch,” concluded Kapron. “Some of that money is likely coming back to bitcoin, especially as the price of Zcash drops along with its volatility.”

Kapron’s observations on the “back to bitcoin” trend seem especially interesting. In fact, despite the interest raised by alternative blockchains, only bitcoin has achieved real popularity as a safe asset for investors, Therefore, a weak CNY is likely to continue to make switching to bitcoin more and more appealing for Chinese investors.

“This has clearly been a year of blockchain in China with positive government involvement and major investment,” said John Riggins, Editor of GongShi Tan. “Meanwhile, bitcoin prices have snuck up past 2-year highs.”

“This bitcoin price momentum has shown that bitcoin, the original blockchain use case, is still alive and well and that China can continue to be the driver in terms of adoption and price movement,” added Riggins. “The team at GongShi Tan is excited to cover these developments from the ground in Shanghai, as we aim to be a reliable and insightful information source in China and bridge from China to the English-speaking world.”",Law & Justice,0.0516
2016/12/2,Ross Ulbricht Reflects on Life in Prison; New Proof of Evidence-Tampering by Law Enforcement,"Today, in a breaking development, Ross Ulbricht’s defense team has revealed that on November 18, 2013, someone logged into accounts on the Silk Road forum associated with “Dread Pirate Roberts” (DPR) while Ulbricht was already in custody following his arrest on October 1. Along with evidence that evidence-tampering may have taken place, this fact was documented in a discovery letter this week by his legal team.

The revelation follows last year’s conviction of Drug Enforcement agent, Carl Mark Force IV, and Secret Service / NSA agent, Shaun Bridges, both of whom were Silk Road investigators. Both used pseudonyms to pilfer bitcoins from the site, and attempted to extort money from DPR. In addition, they both had high-level admin access to the site, with the ability to access accounts, manipulate data and change passwords.

In 2013, Ulbricht was arrested for running Silk Road as DPR, a multimillion dollar online enterprise popular with drug dealers and others engaging in anonymous transactions. He was later sentenced to life without parole plus 40 years on five non-violent counts: Distribution of Narcotics by Means of the Internet; Continuing Criminal Enterprise; Conspiracy to Commit and Aid and Abet Computer Hacking; Conspiracy to Traffic in Fraudulent Identity Documents; and, Money Laundering Conspiracy. Early in the case there were also allegations of murder-for-hire schemes involving Ulbricht, but he was not charged with them at trial and they have never been substantiated.

Federal authorities have cast Ulbricht as generally dangerous, a potential threat to society. Others with more of a libertarian, anarcho-capitalist bent go so far as to assert that he is being made an example of for having the audacity to champion freedom and liberty.

Throughout Ross’ journey of imprisonment, his mother Lyn Ulbricht has been his biggest champion. She has doggedly persisted in advocating for his release, traveling the world to speak at freedom festivals and events while garnering thousands of dollars in support of her son’s appeal. She has been a lightning rod for public discourse on topics ranging from due process rights and sentencing laws to fair trials and internet rights.

In an exclusive interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Lyn shared the contents of a letter written to her by Ross from prison. With her permission, below are a few excerpts that he shared about his imprisonment and the wisdom he has garnered from the experience:

On the Brutal Realities of Prison Life

The scope of my life became very narrow once I was locked up. My contact with the outside was limited to an hour visit each week, 300 phone minutes, letters and whatever was on TV and the radio. My diet was, well…let’s just say it’s not what I’d like it to be. And my social circle became the 99 other prisoners in my unit and a handful of regular guards. This was shocking on a visceral level, like being thrown in an ice bath. The contrast with freedom was especially intense because I spent the first six weeks in different levels of isolation.

Settling Into Life Among the General Prison Population

Once I’d been released from solitary into the general population and somewhat settled into my new reality, the war within truly began. It started with boredom. There were very few things to distract me during the many hours of the day. I did what I could to prepare my defense. I played ping pong for hours on end. I had textbooks sent in to study. I read several books every month. I took up yoga and practiced diligently for months and months. Eventually the distractions wore thin and a kind of subtle panic set in.

On Handling Day-to-Day Prison Life

There’s another route I’ve seen some men take in here and I’ve done my best to emulate them. The first who taught me how to do time had spent 12 years in maximum security penitentiaries. I noticed he was never in a rush. Crossing his path could turn into an hour-long conversation about anything, either serious or funny, but never dull. He taught me acceptance.

“You have to confront the horror of your situation, come to grips with it and accept where you’re at,” he said to me one day as we sat chatting in his cell. “Give yourself a pass for a few days, maybe a week. Don’t worry about anything else and just feel the sadness, the fear, the loss, but don’t wallow in it for too long either. Get back to your yoga and the rest of your routine when you’re done.

A Major Revelation

This hit home recently when I was locked in (with) my last cell mate. The facility I’m in is widely regarded as one of the most constrained and difficult to live in. I realized, even if I spend the rest of my life behind bars as I’ve been sentenced to do, I’ll never be worse off than right now.

“I got this,” I thought. “No matter what happens I can get through it and come out better on the other side.” I looked over at my cellmate, who was looking kinda bored, and a silly impulse hit me. I kneeled next to him where he lay on his bunk and held his gaze in mock seriousness.

“We got this,” I whispered intensely.

The full text of Ross’s letter can be found on the FreeRoss.org website.

Lyn Ulbricht: “We Only Know The Tip of the Iceberg”

“Ross is a wonderful person, as the 100 letters written to the judge (and posted at FreeRoss.org) demonstrate,” said Lyn Ulbricht in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. “He is no danger to anyone, but on the contrary could contribute to others and his community if set free. In addition, he did not receive a fair trial, as his appeal argues. Rather, it was a travesty of justice that must be rectified.”

With respect to the recent revelations that could prove significant in his case, Lyn comments:

“We have recently learned that someone using the Dread Pirate Roberts account logged into the Silk Road forum nearly seven weeks after Ross was arrested. A record of this was buried deep within the five to six terabytes the government produced in the discovery. The evidence shows that the last login by DPR was made November 18, 2013, four days before the Silk Road forum was taken offline on November 22, 2013. Ross Ulbricht was arrested on Oct. 1, 2013, and has been in custody ever since.”

Lyn says that the recently uncovered evidence is mentioned in the demand for additional discovery that was sent to the AUSA in Maryland:

“There is a record in the database for every account, showing the most recent login. We don’t know when that person or persons originally gained access, or how many times they logged into Silk Road as DPR. We don’t know how many DPRs there were. What we now know from the discovery evidence provided by the government is that the last time someone using the DPR account logged into the Silk Road Forum was November 18, 2013, when Ross Ulbricht had been in prison for nearly seven weeks.”

She continues:

“Joshua Dratel, Ross' lawyer, said a long time ago that we only know the tip of the iceberg regarding the corruption in this case. This week we have seen another big chunk of ice revealed: evidence tampering and apparently at least one additional DPR. If this backup of the forum database had not been saved or discovered; if logins made by DPR after Ross' arrest were not found, no one would be the wiser. This begs the question: how much more is there? Unfortunately we may never know, as it's the nature of digital evidence that it's easily changed, planted or deleted without a trace. That my son — or anyone — would get a life sentence without parole based on vulnerable digital evidence, especially when it's been corrupted, puts us all in peril.”

Throughout her son’s imprisonment, Lyn says that her main fear is that his time spent behind bars would break his spirit. But she notes that Ross has shown great strength, both mentally and emotionally. “Of course he has his down times, but he pulls himself out of it. He has worked at being intentionally positive in a very tough place, and makes a point of contributing to fellow inmates in many ways, including tutoring, teaching classes and being a good example.”

Lyn says she tires of hearing the myths being perpetuated in the media and otherwise regarding Ross and Silk Road. “Anyone who knows Ross will tell you that it is absurd to depict him as a thuggish kingpin who would advocate violence to protect his empire. And it is important to note that murder-for-hire charges were never made at trial. Ross is not motivated by money or power, but rather is committed to his ideals of freedom and peace. This is obvious in his writings, and to anyone who knows him.”

Amid the ongoing flow of new information pouring in about Ulbricht’s case, public support for his release continues to grow. This Sunday, December 4 from 2-10 p.m. EST, a Free Ross-A-Thon livestream is being hosted by FreeRoss.org to bring awareness to Ross Ulbricht’s Silk Road trial, and to raise funds for the printing and binding of Ulbricht’s appeal documents.

The livestream will feature well known bitcoiners, economists, activists, policy analysts, historians, filmmakers, musicians and thought leaders, including Jeffrey Tucker, Jeff Berwick, Roger Ver, Jesse Ventura, Brian Doherty, Carla Gericke, Tatiana Moroz, Tom Woods, Bob Murphy, Doug Casey, and the Ulbricht family among many others.

In terms of what’s next for Ross in the new year, Lyn says, “He will probably receive the appellate court's ruling on his appeal and will then know if he will be allowed a new trial. If he is, hopefully this time it will be a fair one in which the jury is told all the evidence.”",Law & Justice,-0.5106
2016/12/15,Revelations of Evidence Tampering Help Boost Global Support of Ross Ulbricht,"In a display of support, on December 4 a worldwide audience tuned in to Free Ross-A-Thon. The eight hour online fundraiser set a $14,000 target to offset expenses tied to Ulbricht’s court appeal. The event surpassed all expectations by yielding $50,000 from contributors around the world. The largest donation, in the amount of $25,000, came from Bitcoin angel investor and spirited advocate Roger Ver.

After being convicted of seven non-violent charges, Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison without parole in May of 2015 for his alleged role in orchestrating the Silk Road website. He is currently appealing his conviction and sentence in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.

“The idea that anyone could receive a life sentence for creating an ecommerce website, regardless of the products being sold, shocks the conscience,” Ver said to Bitcoin Magazine. “Any moral person should be opposed to this kind of draconian sentence.”

The fundraiser follows recent evidence gathered by Ulbricht’s legal team alleging proof of evidence tampering. A previously undiscovered copy of the Silk Road forum database clearly shows that someone with access to the site deleted significant portions of evidence, according to Ulbricht’s lawyers. This new revelation has added another twist to a case already saddled with unsubstantiated details and questionable conclusions.

The legal team also discovered proof that someone other than Ulbricht used the Dread Pirate Roberts account to log into the site nearly seven weeks after Ulbricht was taken into custody. This contradicts assertions by the government that Ulbricht was the sole user of the Dread Pirate Roberts account.

Says Lyn Ulbricht, Ross’ mother: “If this backup of the forum database had not been found; if logins made by DPR after Ross' arrest were not discovered, no one would be the wiser. This begs the question: how much more is there? We may never know, as digital evidence is easily changed, planted or deleted without a trace. That my son — or anyone — would receive a life sentence based on such vulnerable evidence, especially when there is proof of corruption and tampering, is a travesty of justice.”

In an earlier exclusive interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Lyn shared details of Ross’s imprisonment, including contents of a letter he’d written to her from prison.

Jeffrey Tucker, Distinguished Fellow with the Foundation for Economic Education and Chief Liberty Officer and founder of Liberty.me, also weighed in on the significance of this case:

“I was very grateful to be part of the Ross-A-Thon. From the time of his trial and sentencing, he has never left our minds. No justice is served by locking him up like this. The sentence alone, based on incompletely and strangely distorted information, was cruel to the point of absurdity. Meanwhile, the aims of the war on drugs have been in no way advanced by this.”

“Ross is an idealist, a man who wanted to create a truly free market. Human liberation was his aim. He might have been naive concerning the challenge he set up for government officials and entrenched drug lords. But his solution is the way of the future. In that sense, he is a great innovator. A society that locks up such people is not a just one.”

“I commend everyone who continues to work for Ross's freedom. Like others, I'm convinced we will see it in our time, and that history will regard him as a political prisoner who overcame a terrible fate to live a triumphant and beautiful life. It's sad that something like this should ever happen. But perhaps his life will be seen — as with so many political prisoners before — as a warning sign to all societies of the brutality of intolerance and ignorance.”",Law & Justice,0.7964
2016/12/21,New Chinese Committee Bids on Blockchain to Disrupt Logistics,"At the 2016 China Shenzhen Fintech Summit held on December 20, 2016, the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing (CFLP) announced the establishment of the Blockchain Application Sub-Committee in an effort to bring the logistics industry into the digital era by leveraging blockchain technology.

The Sub-Committee, a collaborative initiative by the CFLP, several Chinese logistics companies, financial institutions and local blockchain startup, Shenzhen Digital Singularity (BitKan), has devoted itself to transforming the logistics industry by introducing the use of blockchain technology. The Sub-Committee will actively promote blockchain education, it said at the conference.

Liu Yang, CEO of Shenzhen Digital Singularity (BitKan), told Bitcoin Magazine that industry could greatly benefit from blockchain, which has the potential to significantly streamline logistics and supply chains by cutting out intermediaries and upgrading traditionally paper-based and time-consuming processes for the digital age.

In addition to cost savings and greater efficiency, the blockchain could bring an unprecedented level of transparency to all processes by allowing better tracking of orders and assets, reducing errors, and enabling supply chain entities to identify attempted fraud more easily.

""The procedures of logistics are so long that problems occur constantly,"" said Yang. ""Problems like losses and cargo shipping mistakes require powerful tracing ability. It is obvious the blockchain technology can perform well for logistics in that regard.""

Shenzhen Digital Singularity (BitKan), the only blockchain company participating on the Sub-Committee, will work with traditional logistics and supply chain companies to develop comprehensive blockchain solutions that address real problems, the company said. It will also be responsible for setting standards and regulations for the field. Yang said he will run for “the Presidency of the Standard Committee.”

Supply chain needs in China have changed dramatically in recent years as China has shifted from being an underdeveloped manufacturing country to becoming a world leader in exports.

China overtook Japan as the leading Asian exporter in 2004, three years after its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). The country surpassed the United States in 2007 and Germany in 2009 to become the world's leading exporter.

In 2012, China's merchandise exports accounted for 12 per cent of the world's trade merchandise exports, according to the WTO.

Blockchain for Financial Supply Chains

Initially known as the underlying technology powering Bitcoin, the blockchain has caught the attention of the financial services industry, and now the logistics industry, by promising greater efficiency. Applications and use cases for the blockchain have greatly expanded beyond Bitcoin, Yang said.

Yet, the blockchain is in its infancy, he acknowledged, and players are still exploring the opportunities and challenges related to the technology.

Nevertheless, Yang believes that in the near future, ""the perfect combination of blockchain technology and logistics industry will tackle the financial hindrances in logistics, and significantly improve efficiency.""

The Sub-Committee said it is working on a ""blockchain-based company credit mechanism."" The system would use blockchain to ""tag and anchor the credit rating of supply chain companies.""

The group said it will be targeted at small and medium sized companies which cannot rely on traditional lenders for loans. Big corporations impose tough payment terms on smaller vendors, forcing them to wait for weeks, if not months, before being paid.

""On-credit orders are a big concern for the industry. Upper stream companies cannot receive timely payments from big companies. A one month of delay is commonly seen,"" Yang said.

""That's why small companies are struggling. Banks will simply turn away: they need factories and warehouses as collateral. Blockchain technology, however, can help by making company financials transparent to the extent that the financial institutions can understand their operational status thus, ultimately, removing the hindrance for loan.""

Founded in 2013, Shenzhen Digital Singularity (BitKan) was launched by former employees of China-based IT and internet giants, Huawei and Tencent. The company operates BitKan, a popular all-in-one app that lets users track bitcoin’s price, set alerts, keep up with industry news and trade bitcoins over-the-counter.

2017/1/6,PBOC Meets With Leading Chinese Bitcoin Exchanges Amid Price Volatility,"The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) initiated meetings this week with leading bitcoin exchanges in both Beijing and Shanghai. PBOC representatives in Beijing met with OKCoin and Huobi while PBOC representatives in Shanghai met with BTCC.

On the evening of Friday, January 6 in China, the PBOC offices in Beijing and Shanghai both issued statements on the meetings, noting that the “recent bitcoin price is highly volatile” and that the bank encourages the exchanges to “operate strictly in accordance with the laws and regulations of China and to conduct self-examination based on related laws and correct any possible irregularities.”

The statements also urged citizens to “invest with rationale in bitcoin and thus bear the possible risks on their own.”

The PBOC’s full statements can be found below.

Huobi, OKCoin and BTCC account for 90 percent of Bitcoin’s global trading volume and saw prices near historical highs in the past 36 hours before they fell dramatically.

Zhu Jiawei, COO of Huobi, confirmed with Bitcoin Magazine that the exchange met with the PBOC and gave the following statement:

“Huobi will conduct strict self inspection according to requirements from PBOC and other authorities, and laws and regulations. Huobi also plans to establish an industry association with other companies to promote self discipline, and the formation of industry standards.”

Jiawei added the warning that “investors should control the risk because bitcoin is an investment product with high risk, traded 24/7 and without limitation on the value fluctuation.”

BTCC also confirmed meeting with the PBOC and issued the following statement:

“BTCC regularly meets with the PBOC and we work closely with them to ensure that we are operating in accordance with the laws and regulations of China. As the longest running exchange in the world, we have always adhered to strict AML/KYC policies and continue to be compliant with all current regulations in China. The press release put forth from the PBOC today outlines that there is significant volatility in bitcoin trading, and also quoted from a notice released in 2013 saying that bitcoin is a virtual good and doesn’t have legal tender status. All of our users should be aware of the current policies on virtual goods as well as the risks involved in trading in volatile markets.”

OKCoin has not yet responded to requests for comment from Bitcoin Magazine.

The PBOC has been meeting with exchanges on a semi-regular basis in recent months. However, the timing of these meetings and the nature of the statements suggest that they were a direct result of recent dramatic price movement.

China’s financial markets have a long history of government involvement and intervention. The fact that the PBOC is making public statements about bitcoin and reaffirming its own commitment to ensuring the operational integrity of exchanges in the country could be interpreted as a recognition of bitcoin’s increasing viability.

From the trading perspective of bitcoin’s price movement and the PBOC’s statement, BitMex’s Arthur Hayes commented, “The PBOC didn't say anything new. They crushed CNH shorts and BTC longs this year. The trade is clear: short CNH or CNY and buy bitcoin.”

Interestingly, the price of bitcoin cratered just as it reached 8,888 CNY. Eight is regarded as the luckiest number in Chinese culture and appears to have been a profit-taking point for many investors.



Statement from BPOC Shanghai:



The recent bitcoin price is highly volatile. To prevent risks and uphold financial stability, PBOC Shanghai and Financial Office of Shanghai have jointly met the major heads of BTCC to know the current status of Bitcoin trading. “We have reminded BTCC of the possible risks and require it to operate strictly in accordance with the laws and regulations of China. We have urged BTCC to conduct self-examination based on the related laws and correct any possible irregularities.”

In accordance with the Joint Notice of Bitcoin Risk Prevention by the People’s Bank of China, Ministry of Industry and Information, China Securities Regulatory Commission China Banking Regulatory Commission, China Insurance Regulatory Commission, bitcoin is a specific virtual good. It is not law-based and compulsory like currency and thus does not have legal status as a currency. It should not and shall not be circulated as a currency in the market. Individuals and institutions should treat virtual goods and virtual currency properly. They should invest with rationale, bear the possible risks on their own, uphold their own assets and have a correct understanding and concept of currency.

2017/1/20,Dutch Authorities Ramp Up Fight Against Bitcoin Money Laundering,"Dutch public prosecutors and the tax inspection agency are ramping up their fight against bitcoin money laundering this year.

According to research conducted by Dutch financial newspaper Het Financieel Dagblad (FD), at least three criminal cases pertaining to money laundering with bitcoin are scheduled for 2017. Additionally, the FIOD — the investigative arm of the Dutch tax authority — wants to lower the bar for prosecution of unlicensed bitcoin traders. The FIOD will also try to have mixing services recognized as money-laundering operations.

The Challenge of Anonymity

Bitcoin’s relative anonymity (sometimes referred to as pseudonymity) and censorship resistance have made the digital currency a popular means of exchange on darknet markets like Alphabay and Silk Road. Europol believes that more than 40 percent of online transactions for illegal ends is done with bitcoin.

Darknet market merchants typically do exchange their earned bitcoins for fiat currencies. While trading bitcoin for fiat is in and of itself not illegal, most exchanges apply strict anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) standards. This is usually requested from the financial institutions and banks that they work with. Darknet merchants, therefore, often prefer to exchange their bitcoins at what FD refers to as “bitcoincashers”: exchanges and dealers that do not comply with such rules.

The FIOD is now attempting to make prosecution of these bitcoincashers much easier. The tax authority wants the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to recognize illegal bitcoin trade as a type of money laundering. That would allow detectives to start an investigation without first needing to prove reasonable cause. A spokesperson for the FIOD told FD that it expects such recognition to be granted later this year.

Additionally, FD reports that the FIOD wants to have bitcoin mixers recognized as money laundering indicators as well, though it’s unclear how far this regulation would reach. It would presumably apply to centralized mixers like bitmixer.io, which exchange bitcoins for different bitcoins to break the path to any particular piece of currency. But users of trustless mixing services, like ValueShuffle or TumbleBit servers, may become a target, too.

Pending Cases Before the Courts

At least six bitcoincashers will appear before Dutch courts this year, divided over three different cases. The first of these are two men accused of drug dealing, money laundering and partaking in a criminal organization. Public prosecutors suspect these dealings involved about $2.6 million [€2.4 million] worth of proceeds from illegal activities. The second case concerns four individuals suspected of running an illegal bitcoin exchange that guaranteed anonymity to its users. The third case is part of a larger international investigation on money laundering.

Bitcoin Magazine reached out to The FIOD for further clarification but received no response at time of publication.",Law & Justice,-0.9127
2017/2/23,Danish Police Can Now Catch Criminals Who Used Bitcoin,"Bitcoin was never really anonymous, and it seems the Danish police have caught on to that fact. According to reports by Danish newspaper Berlingske, law enforcement in the Scandinavian country has figured out how to apply blockchain analysis to hunt down and prosecute darknet market vendors.

“The perspective is groundbreaking,” Kim Aarenstrup, head of the National Cyber Crime Centre (NC3) of the Danish National Police, told Berlingske. “Where the investigation previously hit a dead end, we can now proceed.”

Blockchain Analysis

Bitcoin has been presented as an anonymous digital currency for a long time. But this is not really accurate. While payments are not made to real-world identities, they are made to Bitcoin addresses that are publicly available on the blockchain. If such an address can be tied to a real-world identity, all anonymity is lost. That’s why some refer to Bitcoin as “pseudonymous” rather than anonymous.

By applying blockchain analysis and combining this with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies by bitcoin exchanges, Danish police are able to track down darknet market users.

“We are pretty much unique in the world at this point because no one else has managed to use these tracks as evidence,” Aarenstrup told Berlingske. “Everyone is looking toward Denmark in this field, and we are in close dialogue with a number of other countries right now so we can further develop methods and teach them how we do it here.”

More specifically, it seems the Danish police are using blockchain analysis to close a sort of legal loophole utilized by users of darknet markets like AlphaBay and Silk Road. Contraband — often illegal drugs — are typically shipped to the home addresses of darknet customers. But if the package is intercepted by the police, the buyer can simply deny having ordered anything.

Now, NC3 claims to have developed special software that applies blockchain analysis to prove that the delivery address matches a specific Bitcoin transaction. This has led to two convictions over the past few months.

Cybercrime

In part due to its perceived anonymity, Bitcoin has grown to be a wildly popular payment method for cybercriminals. In a report published last year, Europol — the law enforcement agency of the European Union — said more than 40 percent of online transactions for illegal ends are made with bitcoin.

Speaking to Berlingske, Aarenstrup acknowledged that the ease of use of bitcoin is a growing concern:

“Bitcoin — and virtual currency in general — is widely used in the trafficking of weapons and drugs, and in ransomware and extortion cases. It is used a lot by criminals.”

Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin is increasingly becoming a central point of focus for cybercrime units worldwide. Only last month, a joint initiative of Europol, Interpol (the intergovernmental organization facilitating international police cooperation) and the Basel Institute on Governance (an independent not-for-profit competence center specializing in financial crime) indicated that they would up the efforts to counter bitcoin money laundering.

And Danish authorities have been paying attention to the digital currency for some time now as well. A 2015 strategic analysis report by the Danish National Police mentioned bitcoin as a key focal point to counter cybercrime.

The success of the new Danish tracking method appears to have already been embraced by international organizations: both the FBI and Europol are already using the system, according to Berlingske.

“I would just say to those out there in the criminal community that they need to be careful because we can follow them. They should not think they can hide from the police anymore,” Aarenstrup concluded.",Law & Justice,-0.8832
2017/5/19,Bitmain May Be Infringing on the AsicBoost Patent After All,"The AsicBoost controversy has added another chapter to its book.

Yesterday, law firm Getech Law published an open letter, which was subsequently confirmed to be legitimate by Timo Hanke, the initial submitter of the AsicBoost patent application. In the open letter, the law firm states that several chip producers and sellers are infringing on the intellectual property derived from the pending AsicBoost patent. As such, these companies should “cease production and sales activities of any products in connection to the pending patent application.”

While the letter does not state it explicitly, and Getech Law preferred not to name specific companies when asked by Bitcoin Magazine, the open letter seems to refer to recent revelations of Bitmain’s implementation of AsicBoost in their specialized Bitcoin mining (ASIC) chips. Indeed, if the letter’s claims hold up, Bitcoin’s biggest mining hardware producer may be unable to sell most of their hardware for the time being.

Otherwise, as Getech Law attorney Jun Ye told Bitcoin Magazine:

If the potential infringements cannot be stopped by the announcement and subsequent cease-and-desist letters, we will have no choice but to seek damages in court once our pending application is issued by the USPTO and other patent offices.
AsicBoost

AsicBoost has had a controversial history within the Bitcoin industry so far.

Initially patented by mathematician and former CoinTerra CTO Timo Hanke, AsicBoost is perhaps best described as a sort of “shortcut” that exploits a weakness in Bitcoin’s proof-of-work algorithm. By reusing some of their work, miners can save between 10 and 30 percent of the energy costs associated with mining. This can add up to a significant increase in profits over time — perhaps in excess of over $100 million per year if no other miners use it.

And it could be the case that no other miners would use it precisely because of AsicBoost’s pending patent. The patent application is therefore controversial, as some believe that such a state-enforced monopoly on using technology could further centralize and skew Bitcoin’s mining ecosystem. About a year ago several Bitcoin developers even proposed changing Bitcoin’s mining algorithm slightly in order to make AsicBoost’s technology obsolete.

But the AsicBoost controversy really exploded onto the scene several weeks ago, as it was discovered that covert use of AsicBoost is incompatible with Segregated Witness, the protocol upgrade proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team. Moreover, it was revealed that Bitmain had implemented the technology in its chips. This might explain why the Chinese mining giant has been opposing the upgrade so far — though the company denies this is the case.

Patent Infringement

Now, it seems Bitmain may not even be legally allowed to have AsicBoost implemented in its chips.

While Hanke was known to have submitted a patent for AsicBoost along with RSK CEO Sergio Demian Lerner, Bitmain initially claimed to hold the patent in China. As such, the company said it shouldn’t be a problem — from a legal perspective — to apply the technology at least within the Chinese jurisdiction.

But it now seems that Hanke claimed his worldwide priority date at the end of 2013, while Bitmain’s patent application stems from 2015. And because of the International Patent System (PCT), Hanke’s application should apply to China as well.

“Although Bitmain has also filed a patent application in China with similar features, we are confident that our patent application has an earlier priority date,” Ye told Bitcoin Magazine.

The patent application is not Hanke’s anymore. Two weeks ago, he sold the patent to Little Dragon Technology, a company based in California. According to Ye, Little Dragon Technology plans to operate in the Bitcoin industry, though it was not yet revealed how, exactly.

Either way, neither Hanke nor Little Dragon Technology gave anyone permission to use AsicBoost. This suggests, at least according to Getech Law, that anyone using AsicBoost is infringing on Little Dragon Technology’s intellectual property. And while Ye did not want to name any specific companies that may be infringing on the intellectual property — Bitmain or otherwise — he did reveal it may be more than one company.

As the open letter states:

“To date, no individual or business entity has been authorized to use or sell products based on the ASICBOOST patent application, yet some bitcoin miner manufacturers have implemented various features of the pending ASICBOOST patent in their mining hardware and firmware, potentially infringing the pending ASICBOOST patent.”

Consequences

In the open letter published yesterday, Getech Law wrote that ASIC producers should immediately cease production and sales of AsicBoost-related products. Additionally, the letter said infringers should contact Getech Law and disclose their relevant production and sales records since 2015. And it called on people who know more about potential patent infringement to contact the law firm.

If ASIC producers do continue to produce or sell AsicBoost-related products, Getech Law warned that there would be subsequent legal action.

“The open letter (announcement) is the first step to enforce my client’s IP rights. We hope that the community can become aware of the potential infringement,” Ye told Bitcoin Magazine.

The future for AsicBoost itself seems unclear, too. While debate over whether or not to disable it on a protocol level is ongoing within Bitcoin’s technical community, the open letter spoke of an “unfair advantage” it could give to miners.

And, speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Ye said:

“We do not want to monopoly the market based on the pending patent. That is, we hope anyone who wants to use the technology can come to us such that we can negotiate reasonable license agreements for them to use the technology.”

Bitmain stated that they were not available for comment at time of publication.",Law & Justice,0.7409
2017/6/13,Will Blockchain-Based Gun Control Keep Your Family Safer?,"Gun violence continues to be a hot topic. Gang violence in neighborhoods, terrorist attacks in cities, accidental gun discharge among kids, mass attacks at schools and businesses — these and other forms of gun activities are leading to calls for reform throughout the world.

Through the use of smart technology, the startup Blocksafe seeks to deliver a blockchain-centric solution for gun ownership and their safe use. Its core premise is predicated on a key issue tied to firearms, namely the danger they pose when they migrate into the hands of non-owners.

With the support of the Blocksafe Foundation, an organization evangelizing smart-gun technology and gun-ownership freedoms, an innovative device and decentralized network is advancing in its development. Its mission is to create a safer world through weapons tracking and accountability, preventing guns from falling into the wrong hands and being utilized by unauthorized gun users.

Citizens, law enforcement agencies and armed security firms will have 24/7 real-time access to the secure and anonymous Blocksafe network, thereby allowing them the ability to self-monitor their supported firearms devices. Owners can receive notifications if shots are fired by an unauthorized user of their guns. Moreover, they have the ability to locate and disable a stolen weapon, all through the Blocksafe app or web portal.

It should be noted, however, that Blocksafe cannot identify the actual shooter who is utilizing the firearm. Rather it’s more of a tracking mechanism for both individual owners as well as gun store owners, giving them peace of mind as to where their firearms are at all times.

By way of example, an adult at work might remember that his gun is possibly accessible to his kids at home. Blocksafe can help him track where the gun actually is and even remotely disable it. Again, the goal is to offer some semblance of control to the owner in the event that the firearm ends up in the hands of an unauthorized user, which often results in a gun tragedy.

Another illustrative use case: A gun owner whose house is robbed while she is away can remotely disable the stolen firearm, rendering it unable to be resold or used later in a crime.

Pulling the Trigger on Innovation
Kevin Barnes, founder and chairman of Blocksafe, is an honorably discharged U.S. Army veteran, blockchain developer and passionate advocate of gun ownership. He is also a tech coder of 20 years.

Raised among liberty-minded gun lovers, he was taught to embrace the U.S. constitutional right to bear arms first and foremost. As he listened to and read about politicians pushing smart-gun efforts in the media, he feared a loss of life or liberty due to risks inherited by a centralized smart-gun infrastructure. These concerns led him to launch Blocksafe.

In this interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Barnes discusses the evolution of Blocksafe and his greatest hopes around the future of gun safety worldwide.  

Can you describe the moment when the Blocksafe idea first struck you?
Being an avid gun lover, I was at a range teaching my wife to shoot various firearms and she began thinking about what to do if she was overpowered by a thug while she was armed. At that moment the concept of “Blocksafe” was born. 

In layman's terms, what is Blocksafe?
I tend to think of Blocksafe as a light version of particle.io for enhanced firearm technology. It is a full-stack IoT device network that gives innovators what they need to enable users to securely manage their devices and data. Blocksafe can also facilitate an innovator’s use case in IoT development, expediting their roadmap to the market with security and anonymity for the user and sensor data being the major area of focus.

Blocksafe enables innovators to develop a myriad of solutions to solve the problems associated with firearms — such as malware and ransomware risks — that were not possible before without compromise.

How does this benefit the gun industry?
Decentralized applications (DApps) can be developed in a way that greatly benefits companies in the gun industry. For example, a third-party device is created by a manufacturer. They could install a custom-built DApp onto it, so the manufacturer can easily track its inventory and distribution.

What about the economics of your solution?
Economically, revenue can be generated from the upsale of enhanced add-on devices to firearms. With the cost of the IoT infrastructure greatly reduced, innovators can focus on improving their product to meet market demands, especially those from a newer generation who are always connected. Innovators can also better meet government and commercial needs for these enhancing devices.

What sorts of other use cases are being bantered about?
Here are a few that might align with the Blocksafe model.

Litigation: enhancing the authenticity of a camera video allowed in court proceedings.

Product Theft: a gunstore can recoup their firearms if stolen.

Insurance: armoured trucks and security companies in general can better monitor and manage the firearm usage of their employees.

Training: Instructors can use analytics to study shooting skills to better train students, thereby reducing the likelihood of accidents.

What are Blocksafe trigger tokens and how will they work?
Triggers are the appropriately named “tokens” that power every event from smart devices to the Blocksafe network. The token is an Counterparty asset (which may become ERC223 later) that will be introduced during demonstrations at CoinAgenda in Las Vegas later this year.

What else are you currently introducing?
Soon we will be demonstrating with the TrackingPoint M400 to our  smart-gun network. There are many sensors, a smart trigger and a smart scope on the firearm that make it a great candidate to use in demonstration.

We will also be introducing another DApp use case made for mobile phones and tablets called “Gunshot Spot.” It’s a free gunfire-mapping app and token wallet that sends notifications of gunfire and its proximity. Users will have the option to anonymously share the data to the app community, which will be used to populate gunfire mapping within the app using Blocksafe. Think of it as SpotCrime for gunfire.

What steps have you taken to garner support from the gun industry?
We have provided a pilot signup page for our network’s web portal. We are also in talks with many firearm and accessory manufacturers, some of which we met at the recent NRA show in Atlanta. A quarter of them expressed positive interest in Blocksafe as they recognize that nothing is stopping the progression of defense tech and the launch of Blocksafe. One exhibitor summed it up in one sentence: “Blocksafe’s use case is that it enables use cases development for enhanced firearm solutions that were never possible before.”

We’ve also received a lot of support from organizations that support the firearm industry such as Smart Tech Foundation, which we plan to join in their effort to support startup innovators entering the enhanced firearm space.

What is your response to libertarians and others concerned about gun privacy and anonymity?
What I say to them is that enhanced firearm tech is going to continue to develop no matter what. When I was following the smart-gun mandates from President Obama and his administration, all I could picture was my wife, kids and future grandkids with a weapon that some third party could share control of.

As a programmer of 20 years and a Bitcoin enthusiast, I realized the only solution was to bring to market a network that would prevent that nightmare. At the same time, we can use the blockchain to save lives by enhancing the very tool that has been protecting our freedom in such a way that the device owner keeps full control of the device features and data.

As is the belief of many libertarians, I have the liberty to choose how to defend myself and my family. It is our human right. Whether it is using a 25-year-old revolver or a TrackingPoint AR, we all have the liberty to choose our firearm of choice.

But how do you think these arguments will sit with the government?
We spend millions to politically protect our legal rights to defend ourselves. We must also focus on making sure the technology is not used against us — as, without an alternative, the chances of technical tyranny is a threat too great to chance — regardless of the laws.

Plus, I think it is cool not being able to be shot with my own weapon.

What is your long-term, grand vision for Blocksafe?
Simply to continue to help grow the enhanced-firearm space including expanding the consortium globally. We will try to incubate startups and launch Smart Gun News to showcase the innovators and aggregate news in the space. We also endeavor to work with nations to adopt blockchain tech and their smart city efforts in general. Ultimately, as I see it, it’s about promoting a safer and more peaceful world full of liberty.",Law & Justice,0.1027
2017/6/20,“Free Ross” Account Glitch Latest Symptom of Coinbase Woes,"The “Free Ross” campaign which raises funds for jailed Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht experienced a glitch last week, renewing concerns about the stability of the digital currency exchange Coinbase. This occurrence comes on the heels of Ulbricht’s latest appeal for release which was just denied in May.

A Twitter message from @free_ross dated June 15, 2017, created a bit of a social media firestorm. In it, his mother Lyn Ulbricht wrote:


Free_Ross
@Free_Ross
 .@Coinbase disabled the #FreeRoss account after receiving 16.5 #Bitcoin this morning. We need that for Ross' defense.

Later that day, Ulbricht confirmed that the Free Ross account on Coinbase had been re-enabled. In an email to Bitcoin Magazine, she remarked “I think they responded promptly because of the uproar on social media. We are not so sure of their explanation of why it happened and are looking into the record on that now.”

Later she responded, “They [Coinbase] said it was an automatic security response.”

The Free Ross account does not store all of its bitcoins on Coinbase. Rather, it was established as a convenient way to convert donations into U.S. dollars.

This recent hiccup comes as Coinbase, perhaps the world’s most popular bitcoin exchange, continues to face a litany of complaints from users. There have been numerous reports that the exchange shutters user accounts without reason or notice.  It has been alleged that Coinbase frequently flags and freezes accounts when even the smallest hint of suspicious activity is suspected. In some cases, there have been complaints among users saying that any coins they had in the account at the time were never returned to them.

In a Coinbase blog post on June 4, CEO Brian Armstrong acknowledged the need for changes to address the negative customer experiences, which he attributed to growing demands on the Coinbase system.

We’re storing customer funds, and I can understand how incredibly frustrating (and scary) it is when an issue arises and you can’t get a prompt response. We haven’t done enough to keep up with the growth, and we’re taking steps now to correct it. - Brian Armstrong
 Armstrong also set forth a plan to address some of the scaling solutions that Coinbase plans to implement later this year, including faster customer support response times and a new system to flag “risky withdrawals.” He indicated that the company has hired a consultant to consult on scaling and the introduction of phone support.

Bitcoin Magazine reached out to both Coinbase and Armstrong about the company’s continuing service woes in light of the problems with the FreeRoss account. In response to our questions, Megan Hernbroth from the strategic communications department at Coinbase, stated, “This account was initially blocked due to automated security feature because of the links between this account and a previously compromised one,” and referred us to the following Tweet:

She also referred us back to the June 4th blog post in lieu of comment on Coinbase’s other service concerns.

Regulatory Challenges and a New Hire
In a recent announcement on its blog, Coinbase announced that former federal prosecutor Kathryn Haun would be joining its Board of Directors. Haun was the U.S. Department of Justice’s first-ever digital currency head and was tasked with addressing financial, cyber-crime, gang and national security concerns.

Among the investigations that she oversaw were those that led to the prosecution of the two federal agents accused of theft and corruption in the Silk Road case. Both are currently serving prison sentences.

Reports that Haun would be assisting Coinbase did not sit well with many in the Bitcoin community. And the fact that her appointment occurred the day after the Free Ross account was suspended was a hot topic of discussion on sites like Reddit.

It should be noted that given its rise in prominence as the leading bitcoin exchange in the U.S., Coinbase has been experiencing a flurry of regulatory scrutiny over the past 18 months. According to the Coinbase site, it is registered as a Money Services Business with FinCEN; as such, it is subject to stringent anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) compliance requirements in addition to state laws.

In a major development which occurred last year on this front, the IRS requested a John Doe summons as part of a bitcoin probe, seeking to identify and capture Coinbase user information in the U.S. associated with someone who conducted transactions in the digital currency.

On the regulatory front, a bill being pursued in Congress called the “Combating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Counterfeiting Act of 2017” seeks to, among other things, further target exchanges like Coinbase under the strictures of anti-money laundering regulations. Moreover, Congress is considering including cryptocurrency holdings over $10,000 on the list of reporting requirements when travelers are entering or leaving the U.S.

When asked about Coinbase amid this onslaught of regulatory activity, Perry Woodin, a computer engineer and CEO of the blockchain governance company, Node40 had this to say: “I suspect that Coinbase is suffering from the growing pains of being the leader in a rapidly evolving industry. Add to that growth, a changing states-based regulatory scene that requires Coinbase to jump through ever changing hoops, and customer service is bound to suffer. Coinbase has reported issues where Wyoming, Hawaii and Minnesota have overly burdensome regulations, forcing the exchange to withdraw from those states.”  

Issues Persist
As Armstrong asserted in his blog post, some of the technical and service issues facing Coinbase may be attributed to the increasing demand they’re facing amid the meteoric rise taking place in the cryptocurrency world. Nevertheless, concerns abound about frequent outages that throttle buy and sell orders, often for extended periods of time. There have also been instances during these major price movement periods where the Coinbase site couldn’t be accessed at all.

Lamented libertarian singer and songwriter Tatiana Moroz: “I have had countless problems with Coinbase, from repeated errors on the platform to it not being accessible when I’ve needed to sell or buy bitcoin most. It's not a few isolated incidents; it's ongoing.”

Moroz went on to say that Coinbase’s customer service has basically been nothing short of a “nightmare.”

“It makes me feel completely uncared for as a customer and I know I'm not the only one. I have sent service tickets that take 2-3 weeks for them to reply to. Their fees are also high. And there never seems to be a way to reach a human, which is very scary when you have your money there.”  

The Reddit post seems to underscore the frustration experienced by Moroz and scores of others regarding user experience snafus.

“Unfortunately, the subpar tier one support can cause angst that rapidly spreads across social media,” said Woodin. “I don’t know what recourse there is for users who have lost coins. I do hope that, as Coinbase continues to grow and expand, that they put more emphasis on customer support and service. Doing so will save Coinbase and their customers from unnecessary headaches.”

Lack of Options
Woodin also points to a frequently overlooked, central issue in this discussion, namely, the lack of  consumer choice and competition in terms of exchanges currently in the markets. He attributes this in large part to expense and regulatory climate factors associated with launching a new exchange.

“No doubt, it can be prohibitively expensive to meet the licensing requirements imposed by many states. Movement of fiat currency is highly regulated which means any competition coming to market would have a high financial burden for compliance. I do not see this changing anytime soon.”

Moroz echoed this notion, surmising that Coinbase’s troubles are in part regulatory in nature: “What's troubling is that the regulations and other barriers to entry allow it to operate as a monopoly essentially, and it's difficult to avoid using them if convenience is a factor. I’d like to also note that they seem to have a presence at so few of the major conferences. Frankly, this makes me wonder about how supportive they are of the Bitcoin community in the first place.”  

Libertarian economist and free-market advocate Jeffrey Tucker, in conversation Bitcoin Magazine, also weighed in with a final thought: “The fact is that there should be tens of thousands of exchanges. And there were scores that were already opening up before government intervened and forced all of these regulations on everybody. And, of course, that created a cartelized market with only a handful of players dominating everything. That allows them to exploit their customers by raising rates, by providing inferior service, not innovating. Currently, the exchange business is a non-competitive sector that, in my view, is a disaster for Bitcoin.”",Law & Justice,-0.992
2017/6/27,FBI: Hackers Extorted $28 Million in Cryptocurrencies Last Year,"On June 22, the Federal Bureau of Investigation presented its annual Internet Crime Report for the year of 2016. The FBI analyzed the victim reports at the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) and used the information from their database to publish the annual study. It is important to mention that, according to the Department of Justice’s research, only an estimated 15 percent of the U.S. fraud victims reported their crimes to law enforcement.

The FBI highlighted multiple “hot topics” regarding internet crimes for the year of 2016. This included Business Email Compromise (BEC), which resulted in the loss of $360 million from victims, currently standing in first place in the category of most damage caused. BEC is a sophisticated scam targeting companies working with international or foreign businesses or suppliers who conduct wire transfer payments at regular intervals.

Ransomware, an emerging “business form” among cyber criminals, was specially mentioned in the report. When launching such attacks, the hackers target electronic devices — mostly computers and laptops — with malware that locks up the data of the machines. After the criminals successfully breach the systems of the victims, they demand ransom from them. According to the FBI, in most cases, the ransom is paid in digital currencies, such as bitcoin. In 2016, the IC3 identified 2,673 complaints connected to ransomware attacks, with an estimated loss of over $2.4 million.

Another featured sort of internet crime was tech support fraud demanding approximately $7.8 million from the victims. The scam occurs when the criminals impersonate technical support agents from a computer software, security, cable or internet company. After the hackers get in contact with the victims, they convince them to provide remote access to their devices. Once the criminals have control over their systems, additional criminal activity occurs. Multiple companies, including Microsoft and Mozilla, alerted their customers on their websites regarding such fraudulent activities.

The IC3 recorded 17,146 cases of extortion with losses over $15 million, which occurred using the internet. By the FBI’s description, in extortion cases, cyber criminals “demand something of a value from a victim by threatening physical or financial harm or the release of sensitive data.” The agency identified various forms of the crime, including denial of service attacks, hitman schemes, “sextortion,” government impersonation schemes, loan schemes and high-profile data breaches. According to the FBI, cyber criminals often demand the payments in cryptocurrencies from the victims, which provides the perpetrators an additional layer of security since they are easy to send but harder to trace.

Compared to the previous year, the number of reported internet crime cases increased by 3.7 percent in 2016, with the damage caused to the victims rising by $380 million. Excluding the United States, the top five countries affected by internet crime are ranked in the following order: Canada (3,722 cases), India (2,188 cases), the United Kingdom (1,509 cases), Australia (936 cases) and France (568 cases). Among the states of the U.S., California had the most victims (39,547) followed by Texas (21,441) and Florida (21,068).

The FBI also compared the age groups affected by internet crime. Victims aged above 60 had the most damage ($339 million) and the most cases (55,043). People between the ages of 30 and 39 had the second most cases (54,670); however, they lost only 56 percent ($190 million) to the criminals compared to those over 60. Young persons under the age of 20 had both the least amount of cases (10,004) and damage ($6.7 million).",Law & Justice,-0.9979
2017/6/30,How a Bitcoin Whitehat Hacker Helped the FBI Catch a Murderer,"An ethical hacker breached the database of a phony darknet website offering hitman services and leaked the data. The information from the data dump helped the FBI in their investigation of a man who murdered his wife.

In November 2016, Stephen Carl Allwine, 47, of Cottage Grove, Minnesota, killed his wife in “one of the most bizarre cases ever seen,” police officers reported. The husband tried to mask the murder as a suicide, including putting a 9 mm pistol next to Amy Allwine’s elbow. However, detectives arriving on the scene identified the case as murder and collected evidence — mostly electronic devices, such as computers — belonging to Mr. Allwine. Later on, in January, investigators arrested and charged Mr. Allwine with second-degree murder based on the forensic evaluation of the confiscated electronic equipment.

In May 2016, a hacker called “bRpsd” breached the database of a controversial hitman service offered on a darknet website. The service, “Besa Mafia,” offered a link between customers and hitmen, who could register on the site anonymously. The price for a murder ranged between $5,000 and $200,000, but clients seeking to avoid fatalities could also hire a contractor to beat up a victim for $500 or set somebody’s car on fire for $1,000.

The hacker uploaded the data dump to a public internet website. The leaked files contained user accounts, email addresses, personal messages between the Besa Mafia admin and its customers, “hit” orders and a folder named “victims,” providing additional information on the targets.

The breach highlighted the fake nature of the website, which operated only to collect money from the customers. Chris Monteiro, an independent researcher who also hacked into the site, stated the owner or owners of Besa Mafia had made at least 50 bitcoins ($127,500 based on the current value of the cryptocurrency) from the scam operation.

According to a message posted by a Besa Mafia administrator and uncovered in the dump, “[T]his website is to scam criminals of their money. We report them for 2 reasons: to stop murder, this is moral and right; to avoid being charged with conspiracy to murder or association to murder, if we get caught.”

The leak of the Besa Mafia database helped the police investigating the murder of Mrs. Allwine. As the officers analyzed her husband’s devices, they discovered the suspect had accessed the dark web as early as 2014. Furthermore, investigators identified the pseudonym Mr. Allwine used on the darknet, “dogdaygod,” which was also linked to his email, “dogdaygod@hmamail.com,” in some cases. Detectives found bitcoin addresses in the conversations between Besa Mafia and Mr. Allwine, which linked the husband directly to the “dogdaygod” pseudonym, providing authorities with necessary evidence for the case.

Eventually, law enforcement agents analyzed the data dump bRpsd leaked and discovered Mr. Allwine’s email in the list. In addition, investigators found messages between the suspect and the Besa Mafia admin. According to a criminal complaint, Mr. Allwine paid between $10,000 to $15,000 to the supposed hitman service to kill his wife. The complaint detailed how Mr. Allwine had decided to have the hitman shoot Mrs. Allwine at close range and burn down the house afterward.

However, once the funds were transferred, the Besa Mafia communicator told Mr. Allwine that “local police [have] stopped the hitman [from] driving a stolen vehicle and taken [him] to jail prior to the hit,” thus rendering him unable to complete his “service.” The complaint cited Sergeant McAlister who reported that during that time, “no one was apprehended in Minnesota and western Wisconsin in a stolen vehicle and possession of a gun.”

It is likely that the ethical hacker’s data breach had an impact on Mr. Allwine’s case; on March 24, 2017, the Washington County District Court charged him with first-degree murder. In addition, officers have gathered more evidence in the case — a drug called scopolamine was discovered at 45 times higher than the recommended level in Mrs. Allwine’s body. Investigators subsequently discovered that her husband had also ordered the substance on the dark web.",Law & Justice,-0.9994
2017/7/11,Study: Late 2013 Bitcoin Bubble Fueled by Suspicious Trading Activity on Mt. Gox,"According to a recent study by researchers from the University of Tulsa and Tel Aviv University, the massive increase in the bitcoin price in late 2013 was caused by suspicious trading activity on the now-defunct Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange. The study, which is titled “Price Manipulation in the Bitcoin Ecosystem,” indicates that 600,000 bitcoins were acquired by agents who did not pay for them, and the bitcoin price rose by an average of $20 on days when the suspicious trading activity took place.

“Based on rigorous analysis with extensive robustness checks, we conclude that the suspicious trading activity caused the unprecedented spike in the USD-BTC exchange rate in late 2013, when the rate jumped from around $150 to more than $1,000 in two months,” the study states.

At the center of the study is the infamous Willy bot that was first publicized on a Wordpress blog back in May of 2014.

The paper details the data used for the study, identifies the suspicious trading activity and notes that these sorts of manipulative practices may still be possible today, especially in the altcoin markets.

The Data Used for the Study
This study regarding price manipulation in the Bitcoin markets is based on a data leak of CSV files that included the trading activity on Mt. Gox from April 2011 to November 2013. The researchers behind the study then supplemented that data with more information from bitcoincharts.com.

“We performed additional sanity checks of the data utilizing publicly available historical Mt. Gox trading data from bitcoincharts.[com],” reads the report. “We are confident that the data are high-quality.”

Suspicious Trading Activity
In the leaked data, the report notes that there are suspicious accounts in which the country and state fields are filled in as “??” Many red flags are then found upon further inspection of these accounts.

In the case of one account dubbed “Markus,” the report states that no trading fees are paid and the prices on trades are seemingly random.

“In the end, we have concluded that Markus did not actually pay for the bitcoins he acquired; rather, his account was fraudulently credited with claimed bitcoins that almost certainly were not backed by real coins,” states the report. “Furthermore, because transactions were duplicated, no legitimate Mt. Gox customer received the fiat currency Markus supposedly paid to acquire the coins.”

According to the study, Markus acquired a total of 335,898 bitcoins in the 225 days the account was active.

Screenshot 2017-07-10 at 8.11.23 PM.png

Another entity noted by the study is known as “Willy”; however, Willy controlled many different accounts. According to the study, Willy appeared roughly seven hours after Markus became inactive.

The data cited by the report indicates that Willy would purchase 10–19 bitcoins at a time until an amount equal to $2.5 million worth of bitcoins had been purchased. Willy would then make a new account and repeat the process.

The study notes that there are indications that the owner of the Willy accounts was a Mt. Gox insider. For example, Willy was able to trade while the Mt. Gox API was offline, and the user ID numbers used by Willy were high for the time period they existed.

The study on price manipulation in the Bitcoin ecosystem indicates that Willy acquired 268,132 bitcoins in exchange for $112 million. Much like Markus, Willy did not actually pay for his bitcoins.

“Hence, together, these unauthorized traders ‘acquired’ around 600,000 bitcoins by November 2013,” says the study. “Perhaps unsurprisingly, this is very close to the number of bitcoins (650,000) that Mt. Gox claimed to have lost when it folded in early 2014.”

According to the study, Markus accounts for 12 percent and Willy accounts for 6 percent of the total trade volume on the four major Bitcoin exchanges on the days they were active.

In addition to the possibility of an inside job, the study also notes that an early Bitcoin adopter could have artificially driven up the bitcoin price via a security vulnerability on the exchange in an effort to increase the value of his or her own holdings.

“We do not know for sure which, if either, of these scenarios reflect what actually happened,” says the report. “But that is largely beside the point. Our goal is to demonstrate that these fraudulent trades did in fact significantly impact the price of bitcoin.”

According to the New York Times, former Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles admitted to operating the Willy bot in a Japanese court on Tuesday.

Altcoins Open to Manipulation
The researchers behind the study indicate that the importance of price manipulation in digital asset markets will increase as this technology continues to go mainstream. The study indicates that many altcoins are open to this same kind of price manipulation right now.

“Similar to the bitcoin market in 2013 (the period we examine), markets for these other crytocurrencies are very thin,” says the report. “Our analysis suggests that manipulation is quite feasible in such settings.”

Civic CEO Vinny Lingham shared a similar sentiment during a recent talk where he compared altcoins to pump-and-dump penny stocks. “With altcoins, [pump-and-dump schemes] are super easy,” said Lingham.

“Regulators may want to begin taking an active oversight role as the Bitcoin ecosystem becomes more integrated into international finance and payment systems,” concludes the study.",Law & Justice,-0.4021
2017/7/20,Hansa Market Taken Down in Global Law Enforcement Operation,"After darknet market AlphaBay went offline on July 4, many of its users migrated to Hansa Market — and played right into the hands of an “Operation Bayonet,” a coordinated international law enforcement action. Today, both the U.S. Department of Justice and the Europol published press releases stating that Hansa Market has also been shut down.

According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the action was led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), with law enforcement authorities in Thailand, the Netherlands, Lithuania, Canada, the United Kingdom, France and the Europol participating in the operation. Bayonet’s focus was takedown of both Hansa Market and AlphaBay in the course of the same multi-agency investigation.

“This is an outstanding success by authorities in Europe and the U.S. The capability of drug traffickers and other serious criminals around the world has taken a serious hit today after a highly sophisticated joint action in multiple countries. By acting together on a global basis the law enforcement community has sent a clear message that we have the means to identify criminality and strike back, even in areas of the Dark Web. There are more of these operations to come,” Rob Wainwright, the executive director of Europol, said today at a joint press conference with the U.S. Attorney General, the acting FBI director and the deputy director of the DEA in Washington, D.C.

According to Europol’s press release, the European agency provided Dutch authorities with an investigation lead on the Hansa Market in 2016. Europol allegedly acquired the information with the help of Bitdefender, an internet security company advising Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3). Investigators managed to locate the infrastructure of the darknet marketplace in the Netherlands, which resulted in the arrest of two administrators of the site in Germany. Hansa’s servers were seized in the Netherlands, Germany and Lithuania.

Furthermore, Dutch law enforcement acquired information on “high value targets and delivery addresses for a large number of orders.” With the help of Europol, the Dutch National Police collected information on approximately 10,000 foreign addresses of Hansa Market customers. In a covert action, Dutch law enforcement took control of Hansa a month ago, allowing investigators to monitor and gain information on the users of the marketplace without their knowledge.

Casting a Wider Net
It seems authorities planned their actions carefully since Hansa was already under their control when AlphaBay went offline on July 4. Europol stated that the Dutch National Police “could identify and disrupt the regular criminal activity on Hansa but then also sweep up all those new users displaced from AlphaBay who were looking for a new trading platform.”

“The Dutch National Police have located Hansa Market and taken over control of this marketplace since June 20, 2017. We have modified the source code, which allowed us to capture passwords, PGP-encrypted order information, IP-Addresses, Bitcoins and other relevant information that may help law enforcement agencies worldwide to identify users of this marketplace. For more information about this operation, please consult our hidden service at http://politiepcvh42eav.onion,” Dutch authorities wrote on the seized Hansa website.

In total, 38,000 transactions were identified by Europol, who then alerted other agencies in 600 cases. Furthermore, Europol stated they have prepared “intelligence packages” to be sent out to “law enforcement partners across 37 countries, spawning many follow-up investigations across Europe and beyond.”

AlphaBay went offline on July 4. At the time, many users suspected it was an exit scam. Authorities announced the arrest of the Alexandre Cazes, 26, the alleged administrator of the website, who was later found dead in his cell in Thailand. On the day of Cazes’s arrest, law enforcement took down servers of the dark web marketplace in Canada, the Netherlands and Thailand.

Darknet marketplaces have generated massive police heat after dangerous synthetic drugs, such as fentanyl — the substance at the heart of drug epidemics in multiple countries, including Canada and the United States — were constantly offered for sale on the websites. The statements of U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions during the joint press release in Washington, D.C., confirm this assumption.

“Among other challenges, our great country is currently in the midst of the deadliest drug crisis in our history. One American now dies of a drug overdose every 11 minutes and more than 2 million Americans are addicted to prescription painkillers. Every day, as a result of drug abuse, American families are being bankrupted, friendships broken and promising lives cut short,” he said.

“As of earlier this year, 122 vendors advertised fentanyl and 238 advertised heroin, and we know of several Americans who were killed by drugs sold on AlphaBay.”

Sessions asserted that his department’s work is not yet finished and issued a warning to people still ready to engage in illegal activity on the dark web. “We will continue to find, arrest, prosecute, convict and incarcerate criminals, drug traffickers and their enablers, wherever they are. The dark net is not a place to hide. We will use every tool we have to stop criminals from exploiting vulnerable people and sending so many Americans to an early grave.”",Law & Justice,-0.994
2017/11/2,Op Ed: Three Legal Pitfalls to Avoid in Blockchain Smart Contracts,"Increasing improvements to blockchain technology — which allows for the transfer of ownership without the use of a centralized third party (such as a bank) — has resulted in the mass availability of blockchain ""smart contracts."" A smart contract is a prewritten software program that automatically performs each party's obligation in an “if-then” format, while taking advantage of blockchain's decentralized verification system. Uber-secure cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, use the same type of verification systems.

A simple example is this: If Party A pays a certain amount and the payment is verified, then the title to Party B's property is automatically released to Party A and can be automatically updated with correct ownership information.

These smart contracts are extremely tempting. They could easily increase the efficiency of your business, as well as save money that previously went to third parties. Smart contracts are becoming more popular in segments such as real estate, healthcare and securities, primarily due to these potential gains in efficiency and cost.

However, this silver bullet of efficiency and lower cost doesn't come without potential problems. First, will a court even consider a computer program to be a binding contract? Second, if disputes arise, where can the parties sue? Last, do the parties have to go to court, or is the less-expensive option of arbitration available?

Offer/Acceptance: Is It Even a Binding Contract?
Typically, contracts are binding and enforceable under the law if the required legal process is followed. One side makes an offer, the other side accepts that offer, and there is some sort of consideration underlying the transaction. With a smart contract, however, the parties aren't necessarily making and accepting offers — they are consenting to a mutually agreeable computer program that outlines the if-then conditions regarding the transaction between the parties. In the eyes of a court, this by itself may not create a binding agreement. If the agreement is not binding, it may be tough to recover damages down the road.

To rectify this issue, the smart contract should include a clause detailing the agreement between the parties; for example, that this contract is regarding the sale of real estate, and that Party A agrees to exchange the deed for the property (or the use of an apartment for a night, or the title to a car, or whatever the contract is for) for the specific sum that shall be provided by Party B.

Without this clause, the program is merely a set of conditions. With this clause, the rest of the program becomes the conditions to this already-specified agreement and is much more likely to be enforced. Simple, but extremely helpful.

Jurisdiction: Is the Area of Jurisdiction Clearly Defined?
There is a difficult jurisdictional issue on the horizon for blockchain technology. With the blockchain's decentralized transaction system, where the contract actually became final and binding is a question the courts have yet to answer.

Theoretically, a court could find that a party could sue wherever validation of the transaction took place. With potentially thousands or even millions of peers validating transactions all over the country, parties could be sued in random places anywhere in the entire United States.

The solution for this problem is a forum selection clause. A forum selection clause says that the parties agree to resolve any disputes in one particular jurisdiction. Though it is occasionally a spot of contention between the parties if each party wants their own city as the jurisdiction selected, this clause lowers the risk of being sued at any time anywhere in the country.

Dispute Resolution: Does It Have a Clear Dispute Resolution Mechanism in Place?
Last, if the contract is silent, the parties are automatically required to resolve any issues in state or federal court. This can be an expensive and lengthy process. If the parties agree and add a dispute resolution clause, the parties could resolve their disputes in front of an arbitrator instead.

Though arbitration has been vilified recently as the tool of big business, the contract could state that both parties must agree to the arbitrator beforehand or that a neutral third party — such as the American Arbitration Association — could make the choice. This would eliminate any potential bias on the part of the arbitrator, as it would be the neutral third party, not either of the invested parties, choosing the arbitrator.

Further, the parties could ensure that the arbitrator had some knowledge and experience with blockchain technology. Most judges today may not have even heard of this technology, much less conversant in the ins-and-outs of program complexities. Including a dispute resolution clause requiring that the arbitrator have some blockchain experience may be a benefit to both sides.

Conclusion
Smart contracts may be the future of transactions. However, the technology is in its infancy and has not been thoroughly examined by state or federal courts. There are a number of potential issues, such as offer/acceptance, jurisdiction and dispute resolution. Thus, while this technology may be extremely useful for certain transactions now, it should still be considered best practice to hire a lawyer for important or complex contracts, such as the sale of IP or complex services.",Law & Justice,0.25
2017/12/5,Bitfinex Critics Prepare for Possible Legal Action After Cryptocurrency Exchange Lawyers Up,"Bitfinex, the world’s largest cryptocurrency trading platform, has hired Steptoe & Johnson, a heavy-hitting, international law firm based in Washington, D.C., to try to put an end to what their PR firm calls “a campaign of mistruth.”

According to an earlier statement issued by Ronn Torossian, CEO of 5W, the PR company representing the exchange, Bitfinex is “signaling to those who engage in this activity that they are serious about protecting the truth and their business.”

Steptoe & Johnson is known for its work in the digital currency space. The firm leads the Blockchain Alliance, a coalition of blockchain companies and U.S. and international law enforcement agencies around the world.

Although Bitfinex did not spell out exactly whom it was threatening to take legal action against, the announcement comes at a time when blogger Bitfinex’ed has been persistently denouncing the company in a series of detailed Medium posts and ongoing tweets. Other critics have been taking their swings at Bitfinex as well.

“To date, every claim made by these bad actors has been patently false and made simply to agitate the cryptocurrency ecosystem,” Stuart Hoegner, in-house counsel for Bitfinex, said in the announcement. “As a result, Bitfinex has decided to assert all of its legal rights and remedies against these agitators and their associates.”

The Backstory
Bitfinex, incorporated in the Virgin Islands, is closely tied to cryptocurrency company Tether, based in Hong Kong. Both companies are owned and operated by the same individuals, as revealed in recently leaked documents.

Tether issues a token (USDT) that is pegged, or tethered, to the U.S. dollar. Essentially, one USDT is supposed to represent one dollar. By trading their bitcoin or other cryptocurrency for USDT, traders can essentially park their funds in a stable asset to preserve capital. In that sense, Tether works something like a money market account. Tether also allows traders to move their money between exchanges without going through a bank.

Bitfinex does not support bitcoin-to-fiat trading or withdrawals, so if traders on Bitfinex want to sell their bitcoin for fiat, they would have to transfer their bitcoin to a regulated exchange like U.S.-based Coinbase, which links to users’ bank accounts, allowing them to make direct fiat deposits and withdrawals.

In August 2016, Bitfinex was hacked, losing 120,000 BTC, worth roughly $72 million at the time. Rather than declare bankruptcy, the exchange came up with a three-part strategy. First, it spread the loss out evenly among all its customers, giving everyone a 36 percent haircut and then issuing “BFX tokens” as I.O.U.’s to be redeemed at a later date.

Next, in mid-October, Bitfinex offered to allow its customer to convert their BFX tokens to equity in iFinex, the parent company that operates Bitfinex. As a result, roughly a third of all BFX tokens were converted. Finally, in April 2017, Bitfinex bought back all of the remaining BFX tokens and announced it was clear of debt.

Allegations and Concerns
At issue right now is the fact that more than 800 million USDT are in circulation, but so far, Tether has not shown any real proof that it has the money to back up those tokens.

Bitfinex’ed claims Bitfinex/Tether is creating that money out of thin air. He also claims Bitfinex is manipulating the markets through techniques such as spoofing — where a trader puts in a large bid or ask order to make the price of bitcoin go up or down before canceling the order — and wash trading, where an asset is bought and sold simultaneously to give the impression it is in more demand than it actually is.  

He also argues Bitfinex is operating a Ponzi scheme, paying back its debt through accounting tricks, to avoid becoming insolvent after it was hacked in August 2016.

But while Bitfinex is trying to protect its image by threatening legal actions against its critics, Stephen Palley, an attorney at Anderson Kill in Washington, D.C., who focuses on software development, thinks Bitfinex would do better by simply being more transparent.

“Why don’t they just open their books?,” he told Bitcoin Magazine. “What are they afraid of? They are going to have to do that in discovery and litigation anyhow.”

To win in court, Bitfinex would have to prove that the blogger was making claims that were false and unsubstantiated, which would require them to come clean themselves.

“It looks to me like they are using heavy-handed intimidation tactics to shut down someone they claim is inconsequential,” said Palley.

Bitfinex’ed recently tweeted his bitcoin wallet address and said he is seeking donations to defend himself against possible upcoming litigation. One person has already donated 1 BTC (currently worth $11,500).

“This is bloody bananas,” Bitfinex’ed told Bitcoin Magazine, in response to the hiring of Steptoe.

The blogger cited a previous lawsuit filed by Bitfinex, which he claims the exchange had no plans of following through on. In April 2017, Bitfinex filed a lawsuit against Wells Fargo for suspending its U.S. dollar wire transfers. That suit was withdrawn a week later.

“Best to be prepared,” Bitfinex’ed said. “If this is [a] big bluff on their end then money goes to charity, I can't hold the bitcoins while whistleblowing.”",Law & Justice,-0.9322
2017/12/29,Lyn Ulbricht: Ross’s Latest Appeal About “Constitutional Protections and Freedoms for Us All”,"In May of 2015, Ross Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison without parole for his role in operating the dark web site Silk Road. Exactly two years later, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld his conviction and sentencing.

Now in a landmark request, Ulbricht has appealed to the the Supreme Court (SCOTUS) regarding the Second Circuit’s decision. A petition for a writ of certiorari has been submitted seeking a hearing for the overturn of the decision upheld this year by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.

Ross William Ulbricht respectfully petitions for a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in this case.
A writ of certiorari is a demand placed upon the lower court that upheld Ulbricht’s conviction and sentence to turn over its records so that the Supreme Court may review them and determine whether further action is needed.

The nine-member Supreme Court, which serves as the nation’s final arbiter in legal matters, is very selective in the cases it hears, often pursuing those with national significance in order to establish precedence or to clarify contradictions in existing decisions. Four of the justices must vote to accept a case in order for it to be heard.

The SCOTUS has a low reversal rate in Second Circuit Court rulings. Thus, even if the case is ultimately heard, there’s no guarantee that Ulbricht will receive relief or be vindicated.

Kannon K. Shanmugam is the counsel of record managing the appeal. Widely regarded as one of the top appellate attorneys in the U.S., Shanmugam was a former law clerk to the late Justice Antonin Scalia and has argued 21 cases before the Supreme Court.

Ulbricht’s court request highlights two important constitutional law questions. The first involves the Second Circuit codification of the government’s warrantless collection of Ulbricht’s internet traffic information. This case would afford the SCOTUS an ideal opportunity to address the Carpenter v. United States warrantless search case doctrine and how it may apply to Ulbricht’s case.

Second, the Second Circuit upheld the court’s original decision to withhold information regarding corruption investigations into two agents from the jury. This decision impacted the sentencing guidelines -- a key element in the court imposing a life sentence on Ulbricht. Several justices have previously questioned whether this method of judicial fact-finding runs afoul of the Sixth Amendment.

Reached by phone from Colorado, where she now resides and where Ulbricht is imprisoned, Ulbricht’s mother, Lyn Ulbricht, said, “We are battling for Ross, love Ross and feel that he doesn’t belong in prison, let alone a maximum-security facility. He’s a nonviolent, wonderful person that never meant any harm to anyone.”

She asserts that the U.S. government’s aggressive stance involving the drug war and nonviolent crimes has become quite alarming and believes that if the Supreme Court accepts her son’s case, it will have far-reaching implications for constitutional protections of all citizens.

Lyn Ulbricht says that she’s grateful for the massive outpouring of support on Twitter in response to this Supreme Court filing. “We’ve received lots of support from everyday people who know that this is not about drugs but about a much bigger-picture issue.”

She hopes that this case will shine a light on the unconstitutional encroachment of our government and the media sensationalism that supports it.

“I’m not going to give up, and our family is not going to give up. This is about important constitutional protections and freedoms for us all. So we will continue to talk about Ross and our rights as American citizens.”",Law & Justice,0.296
2018/2/29,Bitcoiner Faces Charges After Selling BTC to an Undercover Cop,"On February 9, 2018, officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the investigative arm of the Department of Homeland Security, arrested Morgan Rockcoons (aka “Morgan Rockwell” or “Metaballo”), CEO at Bitcoin, Inc. and an entrepreneur behind several other bitcoin startups, at his home in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Rockcoons was charged with money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, according to court records.

According to those same records, in Southern California, between December 30, 2016 and January 8, 2017, Rockcoons allegedly exchanged around 10 bitcoin (worth around $9,200, at the time) for $14,500 in cash with an undercover law officer. That officer allegedly told Rockcoons in advance that the cash came from the manufacture and distribution of “hash oil,” which contains tetrahydrocannabinol, a controlled substance at the federal level.

Money laundering happens when a person takes ill-gotten money and turns it into “clean” money that cannot easily be tracked back to its source. Thus, if Rockcoons knew the cash was dirty, but traded it for bitcoin anyway, that would constitute money laundering.

Rockcoons was also allegedly operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business in Southern  California “from a date unknown” through August 30, 2017. Money transmitters are required to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).

The warrant for the arrest was issued by the Chief Magistrate for the Southern District of California on November 8, 2017, which indicates it may have taken authorities three months to track down Rockcoons, possibly because he moved out of the original jurisdiction.  

A Different Story
In private messages with Bitcoin Magazine and a series of public tweets, Rockcoons, who is actively seeking donations to pay for his legal fees, which he expects to be between $150,000 - $300,000, tells a different story than what is reflected in court records.

Where the court document says that the the cash given to him was already dirty, he claims that bitcoin he sold to the buyer became dirty after it left his hands.

“Someone bought a machine that makes cannabis oil with the BTC they purchased from me,” he said to Bitcoin Magazine. “I guess I'm not allowed to sell Bitcoin as a U.S. citizen for cash especially if [responsibility for] what people do with that money lies on me.”

In communication with Bitcoin Magazine, Rockcoons said that the buyer told him via text message that the bitcoins would be used to buy a “medical hash machine.”

He added, “Buying equipment in California is not illegal especially medical equipment in a medical State that's been a medical state for 25 years. [A] controlled substance does not have anything to do with the equipment because CBD oil can be extracted from Cannabis and that doesn't have anything to do with Tetra Hydro cannabinol.”

Both Rockcoons’ tweets and his subsequent communication with Bitcoin Magazine seemed to imply, initially, that he had no idea he was selling bitcoin to a law enforcement officer.

According to Rockcoons, the exchange took place in November 2016 (not the first week of January, as listed in court records) while he was living in Northern California (not Southern California, as the records state).

Rockcoons said the buyer found him through LocalBitcoins, an online platform that facilitates direct selling of bitcoin. A user can register as a seller on the platform and be contacted by interested parties. Transactions are done in person or via online banking.

Rockcoons claimed on Twitter that he received $9,200 for the bitcoin, though court records allege the law officer gave him $14,500. Rockoons later told Bitcoin Magazine that he specified to the buyer he wanted less than $10,000, but the buyer insisted on sending him $14,500.

“They tried to entrap me,” Rockcoons told Bitcoin Magazine. “I asked for only less than $10,000, they sent me $14500 [or] refused to send anything and then I sent under $10,000 [worth of bitcoin] to follow the law.”



After agreeing to the terms of the sale online, Rockcoons claims he received a cash payment. He described this payment, in his communication with Bitcoin Magazine, as being received in an envelope sent through the mail. He has not replied to requests for clarification as to whether or not he met with the buyer in person, though he did say that he and the buyer communicated via text messages.



At the time of the exchange, he was camping in the Mendocino National Forest, where he was living in a tent and working on a new project, a voice-operated Bitcoin wallet. Rockcoons said he had been living in the Northern California wilderness since 2015; however, fire and floods were making it increasingly difficult to survive in the area. After another fire ravaged the land, he said he needed cash for evacuation emergencies.

“I was living like a mountain man, so I didn’t really need money but eventually I needed to buy food so I decided to sell some coin; when someone asked me to buy some I usually just always turn it down but I needed cash to eat,” he told Bitcoin Magazine.

He claims the fires were what eventually forced him to move back to Nevada.

Time in Jail
After his arrest in Las Vegas on Friday, February 9, 2018, Rockcoons was locked up over the weekend in Henderson Detention Center in Clark County, Nevada, for three days. He pled not guilty at a Federal Court hearing on February 12, 2018, and was then sent to Clark County Detention Center for two more days for an unrelated charge of failure to appear on a traffic ticket.

“I was in jail for five days with some of the scariest humans on Earth,” he said. “But I [taught] most of them how Bitcoin works, so it was worth it.”   

In his series of ongoing tweets since his release from jail on February 14, 2018, Rockcoons has been portraying the charges against him as an attack on Bitcoin.

“It's not my mess, it's everyone on Earths [sic] battle now or you can kiss your access to BTC goodbye,” he wrote in one tweet.

“This is a attempt to redefine the regulation and the law,” he told Bitcoin Magazine.

“Bitcoin is my religion,” he wrote in another tweet. “God says I can use bitcoin everyday.”

Rockcoons is also claiming he was targeted due to his relationship with the state and the federal government and his Bitcoin-related startups.

He is looking to others to join the “battle” with him, and he is even asking the the Bitcoin Foundation, a non-profit organization that supports Bitcoin adoption and education, to cover 15 bitcoin (worth around $150,000) of his legal costs.

“It seems to me the Bitcoin Foundation has been absent from the Bitcoin Community during troubling times, this would be a good opportunity to show face and show the community that you're here for all of us,"" he tweeted.


Rockcoons’ arraignment is on February 22, 2018 at the San Diego Superior Court in California. He has hired Las Vegas criminal attorneys David Chesnoff and Richard Schonfeld to represent him. He says he plans to pay them in bitcoin.",Law & Justice,-0.8327
2018/3/1,SEC Sends Wave of Subpoenas to ICOs,"On February 28, 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported that the SEC decided to cap off the month the way the top U.S. financial regulator started it: targeting ICOs. On Wednesday, the Journal report stated that “scores” of subpoenas and information requests were sent out demanding details about the structure of sales and pre-sales of ICOs. While the article specifically mentions that the SEC has declined to comment and cites nebulous anonymous sources, the probes reportedly sought the subpoenas and requests from tech companies and advisers involved in the digital tokens market.

The SEC has been outright proclaiming its stance on ICOs as unregistered securities for a while now. In July 2017, a report came out concluding an investigation on DAO tokens, labeling the digital assets as securities. The U.S. regulator has hinted, not so subtly, at taking more action against ICOs generally. Prior to this year, however, actions taken against ICOs, like the shuttering of the Munchee’s ICO or the halting of AriseBank, have usually been linked to the idea that these ICOs were scams meant to defraud investors.

The tenor of the SEC’s stance on the broader ICO market appears to have changed, from hinting that the regulator views ICOs as unregistered securities in violation of U.S. Securities laws to outright warning ICOs of an oncoming crackdown in written and oral testimony. That testimony was delivered by SEC Chair Jay Clayton on February 6, 2018, before a Senate Committee hearing. During his testimony, the Chair noted, “From what I have seen, initial coin offerings are securities offerings. They are interesting companies, much like stocks and bonds, under a new label. You can call it a coin, but if it functions as a security, it is a security.”

Also of particular note to the ICO industry was an exchange during the same hearing that the SEC Chair had with Senator Elizabeth Warren, where Clayton noted that no ICOs had been registered as securities with the SEC prior to the hearing and no planned ICOs had sought registration as securities.

Overstock’s tZERO
Some ICOs, such as Overstock’s tZERO, have purportedly planned to file a private placement memorandum (PPM) with the SEC. PPMs allow for direct sales of securities to investors and are usually marketed to accredited investors. Overstock announced its release of a restated version of the PPM, initially dated December 18, 2017, in an 8K filing this morning.

According to the document, “In February 2018, the Division of Enforcement of the SEC informed [tZERO] that it is conducting an investigation in the matter Re: Overstock.com, Inc. (NY-9777) and requested that the Company voluntarily provide certain documents related to the [PPM] and the Tokens in connection with its investigation. The Company is in the process of responding to this document request and will cooperate with the SEC in connection with its investigation.”

The PPM further states, “While the SEC is trying to determine whether there have been any violations of the federal securities laws, the investigation does not mean that the SEC has concluded that anyone has violated the law.”

The PPM also cites that both of the broker-dealer subsidiaries (Pro Securities and SpeedRoute) connected to the ICO are being investigated by regulators. Pro Securities was notified on February 22, 2018, that the SEC is conducting an examination on their practices and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has issued several document requests with SpeedRoute, dating back to December 2017.

While some in the industry may argue this is more FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) speculation from the media, the SEC appears to be making good on its prior warnings. And Overstock’s disclosures in its filing with the SEC show at least one case where the warnings are being acted upon.  

Editorial Note: An earlier version of this story included Overstock's tZERO among the ICOs that had received subpoenas. In fact, there was a request for information, not a subpoena.",Law & Justice,0.2536
2018/4/6,SEC Freezes $27 Million in Stock Trades From Blockchain Company Longfin,"On April 6, 2018, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a court order to freeze $27 million in stock trades from Longfin Corp., a publicly traded blockchain technology company. According to the SEC’s official statement, the company's CEO and three other affiliates are under investigation for the illegal distribution and sale of restricted Longfin Corp. shares.

Founded in December of 2017, the company went public with an IPO on the Nasdaq stock exchange on the 13th of the same month. After acquiring Ziddu.com, a blockchain company that advertises itself as a solution for the global warehousing industry, Longfin’s stock soared 230 percent in a single day and 2,000 percent over the course of two days, driving its market cap up in excess of $3 billion.

This price action drew the attention of more than just investors and cryptocurrency speculators. Shortly after the acquisition and subsequent price appreciation, the SEC launched an investigation into the matter, filing a sealed complaint with the New York state court system on April 4, 2018.

With the complaint now unsealed and approved, the SEC has an order to freeze what it believes to be $27 million worth of illegally sold Longfin stock. Per the complaint, Longfin’s CEO and majority shareholder, Venkat Meenavalli, approved the distribution of over two million restricted, unregistered shares to Amro Izzelden Altahawi, Longfin’s director and corporate secretary. Dorababu Penumarthi and Suresh Tammineedi, two other Longfin affiliates, reportedly received some tens of thousands of shares, as well. According to the SEC, the three illegally sold their restricted shares on the public market when Longfin’s stock was on the rise.

These sales violated federal securities laws, the SEC claims, which restrict company affiliates from publicly trading unregistered shares.

“We acted quickly to prevent more than $27 million in alleged illicit trading profits from being transferred out of the country,” Robert Cohen, the SEC Enforcement Division’s cyber unit chief, said in regards to the freeze. “Preventing defendants from transferring this money offshore will ensure that these funds remain available as the case continues.”

Longfin, along with Meenavalli, Altahawi, Penumarthi and Tammineedi are all charged with violating Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. The SEC’s press release further states that the “complaint seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and penalties, among other relief.”

The SEC’s total punitive response has not yet been decided as the investigation is ongoing.",Law & Justice,-0.0258
2018/4/9,Nano Team Target of Cryptocurrency Class Action Lawsuit,"A class action lawsuit has been filed against Nano and key members of its core team for allegedly violating federal securities law.

In February 2018, the Italian cryptocurrency exchange BitGrail lost $170 million worth of the Nano currency “XRB” due to a “hack” which has now led to a class action lawsuit represented by the Silver Miller law firm. The firm bills itself as a cryptocurrency investor law firm and currently has actions pending against the Coinbase, Kraken, BitConnect and Cryptsy exchanges as well as lawsuits against pre-functional token ICO promoters Monkey Capital and Giga Watt. Nano was originally known as RaiBlocks and changed their name to Nano in January 2018.

The lawsuit alleges that, in their push to introduce XRB to a wide market of investors, Nano and key members of its core team recklessly directed investors to open accounts and place assets with the small and troubled BitGrail exchange, where the $170 million allegedly “disappeared” in February 2018.

In the complaint, it is alleged that the Nano team engaged in an unregistered offering and sale of securities that violated Section 5, 12(a) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 and wrongly directed investors to BitGrail. The lawsuits request that the court rescind the plaintiff class’ investments in XRB and require Nano to “rescue fork” the missing XRB into a new cryptocurrency to compensate the victims for their losses.

The action is being brought by Alex Brola through the law firm, the defendants named in the complaint are Nano the company as well as Colin LeMahieu, Mica Busch, Zack Shapiro and Troy Retzer. The complaint notes that, of the over 130 million XRB tokens that were generated, the defendants withheld millions, if not tens of millions for themselves, the bulk of which are owned by LeMahieu. It is asserted that the defendants promoted the use of and assisted customers in getting accounts at the BitGrail exchange, where the XRB/BTC trading pair resulted in over 80 percent of their trading volume.

The defendants promoted BitGrail as a safe and reliable exchange for XRB holders. The defendants consistently and publicly endorsed and supported BitGrail, despite many complaints. Nano attracted investors with a feature set that was described as instant transactions with no fees and virtually limitless scalability. In addition, there would be no mining as all tokens already existed and no more would ever exist. The full 26-page complaint was filed in the Eastern District of New York and can be read here.",Law & Justice,-0.7745
2018/4/10,Nano to Match $1M in Legal Fund Donations to Support BitGrail Hack Victims,"The battle over who was at fault when millions of nano (XRB) vanished from an Italian cryptocurrency exchange earlier this year rages on. In the latest twist to the story, the Nano Foundation is launching a legal fund to support the victims and says it will match up to $1 million in donations.

Stepping back, in February 2018, 17 million XRB, worth $170 million at the time, went missing from BitGrail, rendering the exchange insolvent. Accusations and speculation followed. BitGrail owner Francesco Firano (better known by his pseudonym “the Bomber” on social media) insisted the problem stemmed from a bug in Nano, while the Nano team pointed their fingers at BitGrail. Meanwhile, the victims of the breach were left to wonder whether this was a planned exit scam or an outside hack.

Lawsuit
Some of the victims placed the blame on Nano, and on April 6, 2018, a class action lawsuit was filed, charging Nano (formerly RaiBlocks) and its core team members with selling securities and alleging that the team encouraged investors to open accounts on the distressed and unknown BitGrail exchange. The class action is also seeking a court ordered “rescue fork” to return funds lost in the hack.  

Now, in what appears to be a direct response to the lawsuit, the Nano Foundation announced on a Medium post on April 9, 2018, a fund to support the victims of the breach in their legal efforts to reclaim those funds. “We felt it was important to help ensure that victims who could not afford their own representation would receive the same quality of representation as those who could,” Nano Foundation wrote.

Enter Enger
Nano claims it reached out to Espen Enger, a citizen of Norway, who now represents over 1,400 BitGrail victims throughout February 2018. (Enger, himself a victim of the breach, posted a March 12, 2018 video update of his efforts on YouTube.)

After a series of discussions, Nano says it “became confident that Mr. Enger was the best-prepared person to manage a legal fund and a large group of BitGrail victims in their pursuit of justice in Italy.” Shortly thereafter, Nano met with Enger and the Italian law firm BonelliErede.

As a result of these meetings, the Nano Foundation decided to match the contributions of the victims to the legal fund established by Enger up to $1 million. The hope is the gesture will encourage a windfall of donations and establish a total legal fund valued at $2 million.

So far, the victims represented by Enger have raised over $300,000 in a variety of currencies; Nano’s contributions will raise that to $600,000. Nano claims the legal fund will be spent solely on behalf of the victims in their efforts to pursue their legal interests in connection with the BitGrail insolvency.

“Mr. Enger has assured us that any money remaining after those efforts will be returned to the victims,” Nano said in the statement, adding, “Beyond the donations we make, Nano Foundation will not have any access to or control over the funds.”

Nano also says future updates regarding the victims’ legal actions will come from Enger. Meanwhile, Nano continues to hold its ground, stating: “To date, all reliable evidence we have reviewed continues to point to a bug in BitGrail’s exchange software as the reason for the loss of funds.”",Law & Justice,-0.8481
2018/5/24,U.S. Justice Department Probes Price Manipulation on Bitcoin Markets,"The U.S. Justice Department is looking into whether the price of bitcoin and other virtual currencies are being manipulated, according to a report in Bloomberg that referenced four unnamed sources for the information.

Still in its early phases, the criminal probe will bring in other agencies, like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), a regulator that oversees bitcoin derivatives, sources said.

On spot markets, like GDAX, Poloniex and Bitfinex, where cryptocurrencies change hands immediately, the price of bitcoin can vacillate wildly in a matter of hours. Starting in early 2017, the price of bitcoin ballooned from $1,000 to a record high of around $20,000 in mid-December. Currently, the price now sits in around $7,500.

Unlike in Japan, where virtual currency exchanges are subject the same rules and oversight as any other financial institutions and are required to register with the government, in the U.S. and other countries, cryptocurrency exchanges are still largely unregulated, opening up the doors to fraud and manipulation.  

As for the U.S. Justice Department, its probe will focus on practices like spoofing, where a trader puts in a large buy or sell order only to withdraw the order as soon as the price starts to go up or down; and wash trading, where an investor simultaneously buys and sells assets to increase the volume of trading. Painting the tape, where traders trade amongst themselves to make it look like there is a flurry of activity going on, is yet another method of market manipulation.  

All of these illegal trading practices are particularly effective in manipulating asset prices in relatively small markets. Cryptocurrency spot markets are said to handle only a small fraction of overall bitcoin trading, while bigger deals take place in over-the-counter (OTC) markets, like Gemini Global Trading, Circle and Cumberland Mining, where big investors, miners and hedge funds move hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies daily.

Earlier this year, Jordan Belfort, the original “Wolf of  Wall Street,” who served jail time in connection with stock-market manipulation, warned bitcoin traders of “corruption” and “improper trading practices” in the markets and looming government crackdowns. “If you think the governments of the world don’t have the power to shut this down, you are very wrong. They do,” Belfort said in a video.",Law & Justice,0.2111
2018/6/5,South Korean Supreme Court Rules Bitcoin Is an Asset,"South Korea’s Supreme Court just ruled that bitcoin is a legally recognizable asset. The landmark ruling occurred on May 30, 2018, and it overturns a decision made by one of the country’s lower courts in a case dating back to last year.

In September 2017, the Suwon District Court charged 33-year-old Ahn with the sale and distribution of child pornography. Operating a website since 2013, Ahn was arrested in May of 2017 for disseminating some 235,000 obscene files. Even though the court handed Ahn a guilty verdict and 18 months in prison for his actions, it did not confiscate the 216 bitcoins Ahn accumulated in exchange for the porn.

According to the court, the government could not seize Ahn’s bitcoins because, unlike other assets tied to illicit dealings, they aren’t tangible.

“It is not appropriate to confiscate bitcoins because they are in the form of electronic files without physical entities, unlike cash,” the court ruled. “Virtual currency cannot assume an objective standard value.”

Now, the country’s Supreme Court thinks otherwise. The Suwon District Court’s decision was appealed, and, upon being challenged in South Korea’s highest court, it didn’t hold up.

Seeing as Ahn accrued his digital fortune in exchange for an illegal service, the court reversed the decision and mandated that it is lawful for the government to confiscate it.

“Korean law stipulates that a seizable hidden asset ranges from cash, deposits, stocks, and other forms of tangible and intangible objects holding standard value,” the ruling from this Tuesday reads. “Bitcoin is intangible and comes in the form of digitized files, but it is traded on an exchange and can be used to buy goods. Therefore, receiving bitcoins is an act of taking profits.”

Ahn’s sentence will remain the same, but he’ll have to forfeit 191 bitcoins, worth roughly $1.4 million at press time along with some $654,000 in cash. Tracking Ahn’s transactions on Bitcoin’s ledger, the court was able to determine how many bitcoins he received as payment.

“[Ahn] received bitcoins by giving a certain bitcoin address to pornography watchers online. Records stored on the Bitcoin blockchain proved that bitcoins sent to him should be seen as profits online,” the court ruling states.

The ruling is a decisive, if roundabout, benchmark for cryptocurrency’s legal status in the country. It gives digital assets like bitcoin enhanced legitimacy at a time when South Korea is also in the process of legalizing and regulating Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). After effecting a domestic ban on ICOs in September of last year, the South Korean government has approached the cryptocurrency industry with ambivalent resolve. Tuesday’s ruling and the outlook of a formal framework for token sales, however, seem to be steering official policy in a clearer, more proactive direction.",Law & Justice,0.7269
2018/6/11,"South Korean Exchange Coinrail Hacked, $40 Million in Crypto Reported Stolen","South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Coinrail reported a hack on its website during the early morning hours of June 10, 2018. The thieves allegedly made off with over $40 million worth of altcoins and assorted tokens.

Executives announced that roughly 30 percent of the tokens the exchange was housing have been taken, which amounted to nearly $20 million worth of NPXS (Pundi X) tokens, $14 million of Aston X, $6 million in tokens for Dent and over $1 million TRON. At press time, an investigation is underway, and law enforcement officials are working to figure out who was behind the attack.

Coinrail states:

“Seventy percent of total coin and token reserves have been confirmed to be safely stored and moved to a cold wallet [not connected to the internet]. Two-thirds of stolen cryptocurrencies were withdrawn or frozen in partnership with related exchanges and coin companies. For the rest, we are looking at it with an investigative agency, related exchanges and coin developers.”

Coinrail’s daily trading volume is roughly $2.5 million. Though it is technically one of the smaller digital currency exchanges, Coinrail still ranks among the top 100 across the globe according to Coinmarketcap.com. Still, Kim Jin-Hwa of the Korea Blockchain Industry Association describes the company as a “minor player” and says he can “see how such exchanges with lower standards on security levels can be exposed to more risks.”

The Coinrail hack is the fifth major theft this year. Trouble began in January after nearly half-a-billion in cryptocurrency was stolen from popular Japanese exchange Coincheck. BitGrail in Italy was hit in February, which resulted in over $200 million worth of cryptocurrency disappearing in just a matter of minutes. Coinsecure was the third victim, and saw over $3 million worth of bitcoin stolen from its wallet last April.

In addition, an attack occurred just last week on Japan’s Shopin, a universal shopper profile based in Japan. One of the company’s token distributors was recently hacked and saw roughly $10 million in assorted tokens disappear overnight. The distributor lead kept all tokens in hot wallet storage despite warnings from Shopin executives, who claim she was even sent instructional videos regarding the kinds of wallets that should be used.

“Investors have been increasingly worried about cybersecurity issues,” says Adrian Lai, founding partner at Hong Kong-based investment firm Orichal Partners. “At this stage, obviously, the standard is not high enough.”

2018/6/18,Op Ed: The Rise of Cryptocurrency Securities Lawsuits,"As the cryptocurrency market develops and grows, cryptocurrencies have become the subject of an increasing number of securities lawsuits. This year alone, more than 10 cryptocurrency securities lawsuits have been filed in federal district courts throughout the country.

While regulations and laws governing the cryptocurrency market continue to develop, recent activity involving cryptocurrency has raised a host of questions concerning investor protections. As federal and state regulators and policymakers grapple with how to regulate digital currencies, some investors have sought protection through securities lawsuits.

Based on the number of lawsuits filed to date and the recent decline in the price of cryptocurrencies, such litigation will likely increase in volume in the coming year. Investors should be aware of recent cryptocurrency case law to safeguard their rights and preserve their legal remedies. A selection of recent securities lawsuits against five cryptocurrency companies is highlighted below to illustrate some of the typical cases in which investors have found reason to pursue legal action against cryptocurrency companies.

Longfin: Precipitous Drop in Stock Value After Disclosure
Longfin Corp., a global cryptocurrency company, was a “pure stock scheme.” On April 9 and April 19, 2018, two classes of investors sued Longfin and its top officers for allegedly violating Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act. The investors allege that Longfin misrepresented the location of its primary offices and the identity of key employees in its public statements; had numerous material weaknesses in its operations and internal financial reporting controls; and was ineligible for inclusion in certain stock indices.

The investors allege that when this information was made public, Longfin’s stock value declined more than 86 percent in two weeks. The investors are attempting to recover damages associated with the decline in stock value.

Takeaway: This case is an example of a cryptocurrency company’s shares plummeting after company executives disclosed financial information to the public. Prospective investors should be wary of giving too much credibility to unsubstantiated statements made by cryptocurrency companies and should be selective when determining the trustworthiness of sources.

Nano: Danger of Foreign Exchanges and Hacks
Nano, a U.S.-based blockchain developer and cryptocurrency issuer, was involved in a hack scandal. On April 6, 2018, a class action was filed against Nano and its key officials for allegedly violating federal securities laws.

The complaint alleges that Nano engaged in an unregistered offering and sale of securities by issuing cryptocurrencies on BitGrail, an Italian cryptocurrency exchange, in violation of Sections 12(a) and 15(a) of the Securities Act. The complaint also alleges that Nano wrongly encouraged investors to invest assets with BitGrail, which lost $170 million worth of the cryptocurrency “XRB” due to a hack on the exchange platform. The investors are asking for, among other relief, rescission of their investments.

Takeaway: This case is noteworthy because it illustrates the vulnerabilities of cryptocurrency exchanges and their susceptibility to theft. To protect cryptocurrency investments from possible hacks and cyber theft, investors should take a number of precautionary measures, including closely examining where funds are being held and inquiring about the security controls in place to prevent potential hacks.

Giga Watt: Mismanagement Allegations
Giga Watt, a U.S.-based cryptocurrency startup, was a promising venture that was arguably mismanaged by its founder. On March 19, 2018, an investor sued Giga Watt for allegedly violating federal and state securities laws by selling cryptocurrency investments without registering those investments with regulatory entities.

The investor alleges that he invested more than $500,000 in the Giga Watt ICO with an expectation that his investment would increase in value, but Giga Watt “pocketed for themselves large sums of money for their promotional efforts,” resulting in his not receiving “any meaningful return on his investments.” He is suing to rescind his investments and impose a constructive trust over the assets that were collected by Giga Watt.

Takeaway: This case is important because it highlights how investors who find out after the fact that a cryptocurrency company founder has mismanaged funds may pursue legal action against the company. Investors may also protect themselves from potential mismanagement of their investments by researching company governance and only investing in companies whose managers have a proven business track record. Investors should exercise caution if company managers lack experience or knowledge or if an ICO fails to disclose the identity of company managers.

Bitconnect: Investors Allege Scam
Disgruntled investors allege that Bitconnect, a U.K.-based cryptocurrency company, implemented a classic Ponzi scheme. Three lawsuits have been filed this year against Bitconnect for allegedly violating federal securities laws by engaging in the offer and sale of unregistered securities and other unlawful conduct.

Most recently, on February 7, 2018, a class action lawsuit was filed against Bitconnect and key officers for allegedly violating various provisions of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. The investors allege that Bitconnect operated a Ponzi scheme to cheat thousands of investors out of millions of dollars. The investors allege that they were scammed by Bitconnect after being guaranteed monthly returns of up to 40 percent only a month before Bitconnect collapsed. Furthermore, they allege that after the site was shut down, the cryptocurrency lost more than 90 percent of its value, and they are seeking damages and equitable relief.

Takeaway: This case is significant because it serves as a cautionary tale for investors who are promised high monthly returns from companies that do not actually perform legitimate business activities. Investors evaluating an ICO should be wary of red flags for scam cryptocurrency investments, including insufficient detail on how the technology operates and the viability of the technology over time, the history of team members involved in the project, and the legitimacy of the venture itself.

Paragon Coin: Aggressive Marketing Claims
Paragon Coin, a cryptocurrency startup invested in the marijuana industry, is an example of a heavily marketed cryptocurrency ICO that promised high investment returns without delivering results. Paragon Coin drew attention to its ICO with celebrity endorsements, including endorsements by rapper The Game and by its founder former Miss Iowa Jessica VerSteeg.

On January 30, 2018, a class action lawsuit was filed against Paragon Coin, Inc., for allegedly violating Sections 12(a)(1) and 15(a) of the Securities Act by failing to register its ICO as a securities offering. The complaint alleges that “Defendants marketed the Paragon ICO as offering a path towards legalization of cannabis,” but in fact, “the Paragon ICO was simply a method for Defendants to raise capital in order to purchase real estate investments.”

The class seeks, among other relief, rescission of investments and compensatory damages.

Takeaway: This case is significant because it illustrates the lure that celebrity endorsers, social media and marketing statements can have on investors. Investors should look beyond the hype generated by celebrity endorsements and aggressive marketing campaigns and consider the risks of would-be attractive investments.

The Future of Cryptocurrency Securities Lawsuits
As these cases illustrate, investors are increasingly turning to litigation to pursue their legal rights following failed cryptocurrency investments. Given the wide fluctuations in the price of cryptocurrencies and the recent precipitous drop in value, the lawsuits discussed above are only the beginning wave of securities lawsuits filed relating to cryptocurrencies.

By heeding the lessons gleaned from these securities lawsuits and exercising due diligence before investing in cryptocurrency, investors may protect their investments against loss, theft, scams and other risks associated with cryptocurrency.

First, investors should be wary of giving too much credibility to unsubstantiated statements made by cryptocurrency companies. Second, investors should take precautionary measures to protect their cryptocurrency investments from possible hacks and theft. Third, investors should protect themselves from potential mismanagement of their investments by researching company governance and only investing in companies whose managers have a proven track record. Fourth, investors evaluating an ICO should be wary of red flags for scam cryptocurrency investments. Fifth, investors should look beyond celebrity endorsement buzz and aggressive marketing campaigns when evaluating potential investments.

Whether investors in these lawsuits will prevail remains to be seen, but, based on the allegations in these complaints, investors should always be cautious and perform their own due diligence before deciding where and how to allocate their funds.

2018/6/22,Mt. Gox Creditors May Be Reimbursed in Bitcoin Under Civil Rehabilitation,"The Japan-based Mt. Gox exchange had its bankruptcy stayed due to a petition filed by some of the creditors for the commencement of civil rehabilitation proceedings in Tokyo District Court on November 24, 2017, and heard today, June 22, 2018.

Mt. Gox was forced into criminal bankruptcy after more than $473 million in bitcoin was stolen from the exchange in 2014. This latest petition filed by the creditors provides for more options on how they can be reimbursed.

At issue primarily is the exchange rate of bitcoin at the time of the hack, approximately $480 per bitcoin. By staying in criminal bankruptcy, the creditors would have been paid back at the exchange rate at the time of the filing; but bitcoin has risen in value significantly since then, trading at over $6,100 per bitcoin today. This change means that creditors could be paid in terms of the amount of bitcoin lost and not the value of the bitcoin at the time of the loss: a significant difference.

Attorney Nobuaki Kobayashi will act as the civil rehabilitation trustee, but he is not without his own controversy. Kobayashi is responsible for selling large amounts of bitcoin to pay off the exchange’s JPY liabilities; those sales also coincided with dramatic drops in the price of bitcoin.

In the filing, Kobayashi said, “The power and authority to administer and dispose of MTGOX’s assets is still vested exclusively in me, and I will implement the civil rehabilitation proceedings, including the administration of MTGOX’s assets and the investigation of claims, subject to the Tokyo District Court’s supervision.”

Cryptoground continues to monitor the Mt. Gox wallets, which are currently worth nearly a billion dollars, but, as stated in the Tokyo District Court administration order, Mt. Gox’s representative has lost the right to administer and dispose of Mt. Gox’s assets. According to the filing, the proceedings will likely begin in February 2019.

Interested creditors must file a proof-of-claim form by October 22, 2018, even those who filed a claim during the criminal bankruptcy. For any creditors that missed filing during the criminal bankruptcy, this is a new window of opportunity to file. The details can be found in this document on the Mt. Gox website.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.0
2018/6/27,"DOJ, U.S. Agencies Seize Over $12M Bitcoin in a Slew of Dark Web Busts","The U.S. Department of Justice, in cooperation with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), the Secret Service (USSS), the Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), have apprehended more than 35 dark web drugs and arms dealers in a nation-wide bust.

Per the arrests, the agencies confiscated such illicit items as military-grade weapons, drugs and drug manufacturing equipment. They also seized some $3.6 million in hard cash and gold bars, as well as at least 2,000 bitcoin (valued at just over $12 million) and related mining hardware.

According to the Department of Justice’s press release, the bust is the culmination of “a year-long, coordinated national operation that used the first nationwide undercover action to target vendors of illicit goods on the Darknet.” Kick-starting the investigation, special agents for the HSI’s New York Field Division acted as money launderers on dark web marketplaces like the Silk Road, AlphaBay, Hansa and Dream, among others, exchanging cryptocurrencies for cash.

With these leads, the coalition of federal agencies rooted out an extensive network of black market dealers.

“Through this operation, HSI New York was able to identify numerous vendors of illicit goods, leading to the opening of more than 90 active cases around the country. The Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) of the Department of Justice’s Criminal Division, working with more than 40 U.S. Attorney’s Offices throughout the country, coordinated the nationwide investigation of over 65 targets, that lead to the arrest and impending prosecution of more than 35 Darknet vendors,” the press release states.

In sum, the investigation and subsequent seizures yielded upward of 100 firearms, 15 pill presses, more than 25 kilograms of illegal narcotics and synthetic pharmaceuticals, a few hundred kilograms of marijuana, and nearly $30 million worth of physical and digital assets.

Of the investigation’s most notably indicted, nearly all the charged individuals used bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to some degree in their operations. In one case, the federal officials are seeking the forfeiture of an additional 4,000 bitcoin that they suspect to be tied to online drug sales. If seized, the supplementary stash will put the government’s cryptocurrency requisitions just south of $40 million.

“The Darknet is ever-changing and increasingly more intricate, making locating and targeting those selling illicit items on this platform more complicated. But in this case, HSI special agents were able to walk amongst those in the cyber underworld to find those vendors who sell highly addictive drugs for a profit,” HSI Acting Executive Associate Director Derek Benner states in the official press release. “The veil has been lifted. HSI has infiltrated the Darknet, and together with its law enforcement partners nationwide, it has proven, once again, that every criminal is within arm’s reach of the law.”

Announced on Tuesday, June 26, 2018, the investigation’s findings coincide with Congress’ own efforts to police illicit online trafficking and the use of cryptocurrencies therein. The findings went public just a day after the House of Representatives passed the Fight Illicit Networks and Detect (FIND) Trafficking Act of 2018 (H.R. 6069), a bipartisan bill that seeks “to study how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used to facilitate sex or drug trafficking and propose regulatory and legislative actions to put an end to these illicit activities.”

The bill’s proposer, Rep. Juan Vargas, expresses in a press release that the House’s approval is “an important first step in helping Congress understand the full extent of how virtual currencies are being used to facilitate drug and sex trafficking and will help us propose effective legislative solutions to fight these crimes.” As the bill moves up to Congress’ upper house, he “[hopes] to see the same level of support for this legislation in the Senate.”

In a 2017 National Drug Assessment, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration found that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Dash, ZCash and Monero — the last three of which have built-in anonymity protocols — have become increasingly popular payment options for dark web trade. Along with fueling a harrowing human trafficking market, they are also funding marketplaces that are contributing to America’s growing opioid crisis, the administration claims.",Law & Justice,0.8923
2018/7/3,International Coalition Set to Tackle Cryptocurrency Tax Crime,"In a bid to fight the threat of cryptocurrency tax crime, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has joined with tax authorities from Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom to form the Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement (J5), according to a press release.

The J5 is a response to a request by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for countries to do more to tackle tax evaders.

The new task force, which would work collaboratively with the OECD where appropriate, believes ""offshore structures and financial instruments"" when used to launder money and commit tax crimes could be detrimental to a country's economic well-being.

The coalition, which includes the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC) and Australian Taxation Office (ATO), the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), the Fiscale Inlichtingen- en Opsporingsdienst (FIOD) of the Netherlands, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) of the U.K., and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) will gather intelligence and ""collaborate internationally to reduce the growing threat to tax administrations posed by cryptocurrencies and cybercrime.""

IRS Chief of Criminal Investigation Don Fort explained in a Forbes interview why the U.S. decided to take an international approach to fighting cryptocurrency-related tax crimes. He iterated that the U.S. has tried the one-man army approach in the past, but it wasn't successful.

""We cannot continue to operate in the same ways we have in the past, siloing our information from the rest of the world while organized criminals and tax cheats manipulate the system and exploit vulnerabilities for their personal gain,"" he remarked. With the J5 task force, Fort hopes the IRS will be strong enough to ""pressurize the global criminal community” in ways it couldn't make work in the past.

The U.K.'s Director of HMRC Fraud Investigation Service Simon York believes the J5 will make ""the world smaller for those seeking to exploit our systems and ensuring no one is beyond our reach.""

At the first meeting of the group, leading tax and financial experts from the member states came together to develop tactical plans and identify new opportunities for pursuing international tax criminals.

The IRS has been concerned about cryptocurrency taxes since 2014, where it issued a cryptocurrency taxation guidance and announced it would treat bitcoin as a property. Early last year, it assembled a team of investigators to crack down on those who use cryptocurrency to launder money and evade taxes. In its efforts to catch American tax cheats, the IRS once ordered Coinbase to turn over records of over 480,000 users. After a protracted legal battle, which it lost, it reduced its requests to 14,000 users who engaged in trading activity above $20,000.",Law & Justice,-0.9825
2018/7/27,"Lyn Ulbricht and the Effort to Free Ross: Looking at ""the End of the Road”","The darknet site founded by Ross Ulbricht, Silk Road, has been offline for years now. But the legal questions behind his conviction and subsequent sentencing to life in prison without the possibility of parole in 2015, remain fresh, raw and real to Ulbricht’s advocates.

Among the people most passionate in their belief that Ulbricht has been given an unfair shake by the American justice system is his mother, Lyn Ulbricht. Her staunch support of her son should come as no surprise, and it’s a stance that has seen her make her case — that Ross was unjustly convicted and sentenced — to audiences of CNN, the Wall Street Journal and international media of every stripe.

Lyn now has an unfortunate impetus for making a fresh round of appearances, in the recent denial by the U.S. Supreme Court to reconsider Ross Ulbricht’s conviction or life sentence. As a guest this week on The Tatiana Show! podcast, Lyn provided listeners not only with an update on the dwindling legal options available to the Ulbrichts but also with an intimate view of the personal costs that afflict the family members of those who have been incarcerated.

Almost Out of Options
There are many who are unsure of where they stand on Ross Ulbricht, whose online creation employed both Tor (a.k.a. The Onion Routing, an anonymous communication platform) and bitcoin to enable an anonymous global marketplace of items both illicit (drugs were a preponderance of the offerings) and legal (art, cigarettes, jewelry).

His supporters see a man whose guilt was never actually proven and whose work actually served to take on the War on Drugs’ overreaches while standing up for personal privacy online. His detractors believe he became a bitcoin multimillionaire while committing a rash of crimes including money laundering, computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic narcotics and attempting to order the murders of six people. They also see Silk Road as a major contributor to a negative public image for cryptocurrency, a high-profile example of bitcoin as an engine of criminal activity.

For those on the FreeRoss side of things, Ulbricht’s interview with show host Tatiana Moroz did not reveal a hopeful darkhorse plan to counter the Supreme Court’s June 28 decision, which effectively declined to consider arguments that Ulbricht’s fourth and sixth amendment rights had been violated.

“You can’t go any further with it,” Lyn said of the possibility of filing another petition on those points. “That’s it. That’s the end of the road. According to our lawyers, who seem to know these things, there’s no other option.”

Barring the emergence of new legal strategies, the primary hope that the Ulbrichts are clinging to is a granting of clemency by the President of the United States.

“We’ve moved from the judicial to the political,” Lyn said. “His options for direct appeal to the courts has ended. There is something called a 2255 (motion for retrial) that you can do within the year. That rarely works, but we’ll try. We’re not counting on it. What we really are focusing on is clemency from the President, and that means commuting Ross’ barbaric sentence.”

A petition supporting clemency has 38,000+ signatures as of press time.

Family Matters
In her conversation with Moroz, Lyn Ulbricht helped listeners to go beyond legal jargon with another dimension of the case. Her window on the effect of prison on nonviolent offenders, and the families attached to them, reveals the emotional impact of America’s punitive action penchant.

“There are so many people in the prison system now that it’s bigger than 11 states! It’s really metastasizing. It’s a crisis,” Ulbricht relates. “What really gets to me is the children [who are visiting their relatives in prison]. The kids are so happy to see their dad, they’re crawling over him and in his lap, and they have to be torn away. Every time we leave, there are sobbing, heartbroken children, who are being harmed and have a better statistical chance of being in the prison themselves.”",Law & Justice,-0.9904
2018/8/15,BitAngels Founder Sues AT&T for $224 million Following Wallet Hacks,"BitAngels founder Michael Terpin has filed a $224 million lawsuit against telecoms provider AT&T, alleging that its negligence led him to lose about $24 million worth of cryptocurrency to fraudsters, according to a CNBC report. In a 69-page deposition to the Los Angeles U.S. District Court on August 15, 2018, Terpin claims that AT&T “willingly” cooperated with hackers who co-opted his identity and thus gained access to his crypto wallets.

Crypto Wallet Hack
According to the filing, Terpin suffered two separate hacks within seven months of each other, with the second hack resulting in a loss of nearly $24 million in token funds.

He says that a fraudster successfully obtained his phone number by cooperating with an insider, escaping the otherwise mandatory identity check that would be required to get such information. After obtaining the phone number, according to the complaint, the fraudster was able to gain access to Terpin's crypto wallet and steal his funds.

An excerpt from Terpin's complaint reads as follows:

""What AT&T did was like a hotel giving a thief with a fake ID a room key and a key to the room safe to steal jewelry in the safe from the rightful owner.""

In its emailed response to the media, AT&T maintained its innocence, stating that it disputes the allegations and looks forward to presenting its case in court. Terpin is seeking a payout of $200 million in punitive damages in addition to $24 million in compensatory damages.

The event once again brings into focus the lingering security issues within the crypto space, coming on the heels of news that John McAfee's “unhackable” BitFi wallet has allegedly been breached for the second time in as many weeks.

As one of the industry’s pain points, crypto fund security has long been identified as an existential threat to the entry of traditional financial institutions into the space. A number of solutions like Coinbase Custody and a proposed Goldman Sachs crypto custody solution have been mooted as potential solutions to the problem.

Alongside Roger Ver and Brock Pierce, Terpin currently runs BitAngels, an angel investment group specifically directed at bitcoin and cryptocurrency entrepreneurs, and the BitAngels/DApps Fund which focuses on digital currency.",Law & Justice,-0.9666
2018/8/17,Dutch Trader Loses Reclamation Suit Against Banks That Froze His Accounts,"In November 2016, a Dutch cryptotrader tried to buy his first 10 bitcoin, first using funds from his ING bank and later from ABN Amro. Both banks denied the transactions. He subsequently filed a complaint with Kifid (Financial Services Complaints Institute), a resource that mediates between consumers and small businesses when there are complaints about financial products or services.

According to the complaint, the banks claimed the man’s transactions were denied due to fraud prevention measures. It argued, however, that fraud prevention isn’t the reason why ING and ABN denied the transactions. Instead, the complainant accused both banks of blocking his accounts for commercial reasons that were concealed as fraud prevention measures. ING and ABN Amro denied the accusation.

The aspiring trader filed suit for €43,220 (~$50,000). He arrived at this figure by projecting the gains he would have realized if he bought bitcoin at €330 (~$385) and sold at €2,500 (~$3,000 USD).

The Kifid ruling states that it does not consider this lack of ability to trade in any way relevant. Even if the banks refuse to perform a service, it isn’t their responsibility to compensate clients. In addition, the ruling states that the complainant failed to demonstrate that the acquisition of bitcoin was rendered impossible because of the actions of the banks: He could have tried to work with another bank.

Both ING and ABN claimed that once the block had been lifted on his account, he could have purchased the bitcoins. They both claim that the unblocking of the account was delayed for security reasons and the fact that the customer had set their account preferences to deny telephone contact.

Ultimately, the ruling determined that the potential bitcoin trader had no one to blame but himself for not securing the 10 bitcoin and realizing any potential profits.",Law & Justice,-0.9721
2018/9/11,Ripple and R3 Reach Settlement in Year-Long Court Case,"A year-old legal battle between two of the crypto industry’s leading organizations is coming to a close.

After a volley of countersuits that had the companies jumping from courthouse to courthouse, Ripple and R3 have brokered a settlement that will put the drama to rest. The terms of the settlement, however, are being kept under wraps by both parties.

In correspondence with Bitcoin Magazine, a representative for Ripple stated that the company has “nothing to share beyond the statement issued yesterday.”

The legal proceedings date back to July of 2017 when R3 accused Ripple and Brad Garlinghouse of breaching an agreement that would allow R3 to purchase 5 billion XRP, Ripple’s native currency, at a rate of $0.0085 before September 2019. By the time the court proceedings came to light, XRP was trading at $0.26.

After the Delaware Chancery Court threw the case out, the suit continued in the California State Supreme court when Ripple filed a countersuit against R3 to dismiss the suit. After this case was thrown out, as well, the case was moved to New York.

In the ongoing case’s latest filing, Ripple claimed, “R3 breached separate and distinct promises it made to Ripple and XRP II.” This included withholding information that financial institutions J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley would be leaving R3’s consortium during the terms of the agreement, these banks being integral to Ripple’s adoption, the company claimed.

Seeing as R3 failed to “assist Ripple [in signing] up a single bank,” the countersuit sought to nullify the original agreement and award Ripple with a settlement for related damages.

Ripple has become a familiar defendant on the floor of the U.S.’s judicial system. Aside from its legal trouble with R3 — arguably its most important court case to date — the blockchain company is currently juggling three separate lawsuits charging it with the sale of unregistered securities.  

At press time, R3 had not yet responded to Bitcoin Magazine’s request for comment. This article has since been updated with a comment from Ripple.",Law & Justice,0.0258
2018/9/11,OKEx Founder Released After Questioning in Connection With Suspected Coin Fraud,"The founder of cryptocurrency exchange OKEx was detained for questioning on September 10, 2018, by Shanghai police to investigate a case of suspected digital currency fraud related to WFee coin. As of 9:30 pm local time, on September 11, he was released.

Star Xu, who was a shareholder in WFee coin, was surrounded by seven or eight people at the hotel he was staying at in Shanghai and taken to a local police station for questioning, according to Sina news. In a follow up, Sina reported the suspected fraud took place in Beijing; therefore, documents related to the investigation will be handed to the Beijing police.

According to reports, the Shanghai police were responding to several complaints they received about WFee — likely from investors who had lost money in the scheme.

According to data on coinlibo.io, the coin began trading in March 2018, mainly on OKEx. In the last few days, the value of the coin, which had trading pairs with bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), took a 90 percent dive in price, going from $.00033 per coin to $0.00012475. According to the WFee’s website, the company also had its own trading platform WFEEx, where investors could purchase the coin.

“WFEEx is an innovative digital asset trading platform based on blockchain technology, and WFee is the only platform currency on the WFEEx exchange,” the company says on its website. “Holders of WFee coins can participate in trading mining, voting on the currency, exchanges and other airdrops, and can also apply to become a WFee professional investor.”

Xu founded OKEx in 2014. The Hong Kong-based exchange went on to become the second largest cryptocurrency exchange by 24-hour trading volume. However, earlier this year, some critics argued the exchange is a ""ghost town"" and up to 93 percent of its trading volume was nonexistent.

On April 11, 2018, OKEx announced its plans to expand to Malta, a nation island in the Mediterranean that is attempting to build a regulatory framework for blockchain technology and, by extension, cryptocurrency.

The news of Xu’s detainment comes at a time when China has escalated its crackdown on crypto exchanges and initial coin offerings (ICOs). Last month, South China Morning Post reported that the Chinese government will block access to 124 websites operated by offshore crypto exchanges, shut down websites related to ICOs and ban payment services from accepting cryptocurrencies.",Law & Justice,-0.9764
2018/9/12,Federal Judge Applies Long-Established Securities Law to ICOs,"Does a decades-old securities law apply to an initial coin offering (ICO)? In a case that represents the first time securities laws have been applied to cryptocurrencies, a district judge says it may.

On September 11, 2018, in a district courthouse in Brooklyn, New York, Judge Raymond Dearie ruled that two ICOs were securities, based on established laws that govern the financial instruments. His decision does not imply that all ICOs are securities, but that simply calling a token a “currency” does not preclude it from being classified as a security.  

Turning back a few pages, in October 2017, businessman Maksim Zaslavskiy was accused of misleading investors in two separate ICOs. He raised about $300,000 in a cryptocurrency called REcoin, which he claimed was backed by real estate, and a cryptocurrency called Diamond, which he claimed was backed by diamonds. In truth, no real estate nor diamonds backed either of the coins, and Zaslavskiy was charged in a criminal complaint with conspiracy and two counts of securities fraud — charges that carry up to five years in jail and a fine.

Zaslavskiy moved to have the charges dismissed. He argued that his ICOs were not securities, but “the exchange of one currency for another,” and that securities laws are too “unconstitutionally vague” to be applied to his case. 

Cornell law professor Robert Hockett calls the insistence that the laws are vague a “Hail Mary.” “It is a fallback argument,” he told Bitcoin Magazine. “At first the defendant says the law is clear in that it clearly does not apply, but then he effectively says, ‘I have no way of knowing what I can do because the law is unclear.’”

Judge Dearie found the laws clear enough. He pointed out that laws are meant to be interpreted flexibly. He then went on to determine that the two ICOs in question were “investment contracts” by applying the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, one of the most important pieces of legislation governing securities, and the Howey Test, a checklist regulators use to determine if an asset is a security.

Specifically, the Howey Test determines that a transaction represents an investment contract if ""a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party."" According to case documents, Judge Dearie found that REcoin and Diamond investors “undoubtedly expected to receive profits in their investments.”

In his arguments, Judge Dearie also referenced the DAO Report, an investigative report issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July 2017 claiming that tokens sold on an Ethereum-based investment fund were securities, and public statements made by SEC Chairman Jay Clayton on cryptocurrencies and ICOs in December 2017. At that time, Clayton noted that “simply calling something a ‘currency’ or a currency-based product does not mean that it is not a security.”

“Combined with statements the SEC chairman made previously, yesterday’s decision lends further credence to what many of us believe, which is that offered coins will count as investment contracts and hence securities,” said Hockett. “The SEC has made noises that ICOs were securities, but up until now, there has been no official legal ruling declaring they were.”

The case still has to go to trial and, ultimately, it will be up to a jury to decide whether the ICO in question was a security. Still, Hockett said: “I really doubt an appellate court will overturn the district court’s ruling.”  

ICOs have been a major source of controversy in the crypto space. So far, about $20 billion has been raised in ICOs, most of that in the last two years. In a talk at MIT in April 2018, Gary Gensler, former chairman of the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), another regulatory body that has weighed in on ICOs, noted “significant noncompliance” with securities laws in the cryptocurrency space. “Many initial coin offerings, probably well over a thousand, many crypto exchanges, probably 100 to 200, are basically operating outside of U.S. law,” he said.",Law & Justice,0.296
2018/9/18,Texas State Securities Board Hits Russian Hoaxers with Cease-and-Desist Orders,"Texas Securities Commissioner Travis J. Iles has issued emergency ordinances against three separate fraudulent cryptocurrency schemes linked to Russian scammers.

The orders were issued on September 18, 2018, against DGBK Ltd., an offshore digital “bank” that claims to have developed a hack-proof custody solution for digital assets and virtual currencies; Coins Miner Investment Ltd., a Russian cryptocurrency investment promoter; and Ultimate Assets LLC, a purported cryptocurrency and foreign exchange trader.

Coins Miner Investment Ltd.
Based in Russia, Coins Miner extracts money from U.S. residents under false pretexts, pretending to act on behalf of Coinbase, the San Francisco–based crypto exchange platform. According to the Emergency Cease and Desist Order, it does this by sending spam emails impersonating Coinbase, deceiving investors into handing over their money by leveraging the brand image of the digital asset platform.

The order further specifies that a certain Ana Julia Lara, acting on behalf of Coins Miner, falsely claims to work for Coinbase as a crypto trader. To this end, she also sends out a photograph to investors purportedly showing her with the president of Ripple, whereas the person in the photograph was actually a vice president of Cointelegraph Media Group.

Claiming to operate out of the U.K., Coins Miner is actually based in the Russian city of Volgograd, and it makes several fraudulent claims on its website to prospective investors. On its website and in its marketing efforts, the company also deliberately misrepresents a video of a Fortune journalist to make it seem as though its offering is being promoted. In addition, it uses stock photographs to represent its team and its office deceitfully.

Under Texas law, the investments promoted by Coins Miner are classified as securities, but they are not registered to sell securities in the state.

DGBK Ltd.
Belize-based DGBK claims to have developed a hack-proof custody solution for digital assets, and it solicits funds to develop this concept. Claiming to be at work on a so-called Photon Encrypted Ledger Key, a digital wallet that can be opened using biometric data, the company claims that it can facilitate fully anonymous and untraceable transfers of cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar.

Using a misappropriated video of Barack Obama speaking at the 2016 South by Southwest (SXSW) Interactive festival in Austin, DGBK offers prospective investors the opportunity to invest in the DGBK token with promises of up to 1,900 percent returns following the ICO, set to be held next year.

The company claims to have on its payroll a litany of cybersecurity experts and blockchain specialists without offering any proof to support these claims, and it also offers securities for sale without following the necessary registration requirements.

Ultimate Assets LLC
Claiming to be based in Arlington, Massachusetts, but with no provable address, Ultimate Assets promises investors that an investment of $1,000 will turn into $10,000 within just three weeks. It also falsely claims that all initial investments in the trading program are fully indemnified and that refunds will be issued in the event of failure to yield profits.

Its principals listed in the Cease and Desist Order are also accused of violating the Texas Securities Act by offering securities investments without being registered with the Securities Commissioner.",Law & Justice,0.296
2018/9/25,Mt. Gox Trustee Confirms He Sold off $230 Million in Cryptocurrency,"A man known as “Tokyo Whale,” for the enormous amount of bitcoin he controls, confirms he unloaded another big chunk of it earlier this year.

Nobuaki Kobayashi, the trustee of now-defunct Tokyo exchange Mt. Gox, liquidated 24,658 bitcoin and 25,331 bitcoin cash between the creditors’ meeting on March 7, 2018, and the start of civil rehabilitation proceedings on June 22, 2018, according to an announcement posted on the Mt. Gox website on September 25, 2018.  

As a result, the estate hauled in about 26 billion yen ($230 million) in cash. According to Bloomberg estimates, the latest sale received an average of $8,100 per bitcoin and $1,190 per bitcoin cash. Current values of the coins sit at $6,420 and $438, respectively.

This is not the first time Kobayashi has offloaded a huge chunk of crypto. Over a period that correlated with a decline in market prices after December 2017, the trustee sold more than $400 million worth of bitcoin and bitcoin cash. Some accused him of collapsing the markets by selling on spot markets, rather than going through auction or an over-the-counter platform, which is how most big players unload heaps of cryptocurrency.

While not specifying how the coins were sold, Kobayashi has denied those claims. In a document posted on June 2018, he stated that “upon consultation with cryptocurrency transaction experts, Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash were sold in a manner that had no effect on market price and not by ordinary sale on an exchange, while ensuring the security of the transaction to the extent possible.”

Mt. Gox was forced into criminal bankruptcy in 2014, after more than 850,000 bitcoin vanished. The losses, which amounted to $473 million at the time, would be worth roughly $5 billion today. Since then, Mt. Gox creditors have been waiting to get some of that money back.

Meanwhile, bitcoin has risen significantly in price. Also, a code fork last year resulted in a second cryptocurrency, bitcoin cash, which any bitcoin holder at the time was entitled to.

Some wanted the coins, not the cash. In June 2018, creditors won a victory after the Tokyo District Court moved the exchange from bankruptcy to a civil rehabilitation process. This opened up the possibility that creditors could get back their bitcoin (and bitcoin cash), as opposed to a cash payout equal to the value of their holdings when the exchange collapsed.

A script that monitors the cold wallets associated with Mt. Gox indicates the estate still has 137,891 bitcoin and bitcoin cash, worth about $945 million. Whether any more of these funds will be sold off in the future is unclear. In June 2018, Kobayashi said that “nothing has been determined.”

Mt. Gox traders who lost funds still have until October 22, 2018, to file claims. A court still has to approve the rehabilitation plan.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.25
2018/9/27,Federal Judge Rules Cryptocurrency MBC Is a Commodity,"In a landmark case for the cryptocurrency industry, a federal judge has ruled that a cryptocurrency caught in the midst of a lawsuit is a commodity, court documents reveal.

U.S. District Judge for Massachusetts Rya Zobel has decided that the suit’s prosecuting party — the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) — can proceed with its case against My Big Coin Pay Inc. as its cryptocurrency My Big Coin (MBC) does not fall into the category of a security.

My Big Coin was founded in December of 2013. Allegedly based in Wyoming, the company offers its own digital wallet to store cryptocurrencies and a digital exchange to trade them. My Big Coin began selling its own currency — MBC — through an initial coin offering (ICO) and made approximately $6 million from 28 separate investors by promising 1 percent interest per year to investors that kept their wallets open.

The CFTC claims that the ICO has all the same behavior and qualities of a Ponzi scheme. They allege that the company is based in Las Vegas, not Wyoming, and that owners Randall Crater of New York and Mark Gillespie of Michigan used customer funds to purchase expensive items for themselves.

In addition, the CFTC believes the money was raised through several false claims, including that MBC was backed by gold and traded across several different exchanges, and that My Big Coin had recently struck a partnership with MasterCard.

Charges were filed back in January of 2018. The company’s accounts were frozen, and executives were blocked from accessing them. They were also prohibited from disposing of any financial records.

According to court documents, Judge Zobel believes that MBC classifies as a commodity because it is a cryptocurrency like bitcoin:

“The amended complaint alleges that My Big Coin is a virtual currency, and it is undisputed that there is futures trading in virtual currencies (specifically involving bitcoin). That is sufficient, especially at the pleading stage, for plaintiff to allege that My Big Coin is a ‘commodity’ under the [Commodity Exchange] Act.”

Defending lawyer for My Big Coin Katherine Cooper expressed her disappointment in the decision and continues to argue that the CFTC holds no precedence. In the court documents, she argues that “contracts for future delivery” are indisputably not “dealt in” My Big Coin. Thus, the currency cannot be classified as a commodity under the ECA.

“My Big Coin does not have future contracts or derivatives trading to it,” she asserts. “It is not a commodity. Now that we are moving past the motion-to-dismiss phase of the case, we look forward to challenging the CFTC’s ability to prove many of the factual allegations in the complaint. Among those factual allegations are those which speak to the relatedness of bitcoin and My Big Coin, and, therefore, the CFTC’s jurisdiction,” she said.

Defining crypto tokens has not always been an easy feat for U.S. lawmakers. Recently, federal judge Raymond Dearie in New York invoked decades-old securities laws to decide that two separate ICOs, one for REcoin and one for Diamond, classified as securities. Both projects were run by Maksim Zaslavskiy who claimed that REcoin was backed by real estate and that Diamond was backed by real diamonds. Neither entity backed the coins, and Zaslavskiy has been charged with two counts of securities fraud.

Dearie stated that the ICOs in question were “investment contracts” according to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Howey Test, which states that a transaction is an investment contract if a person invests money in a “common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.”

Dearie asserts customers expected returns on their investments and even referenced the DAO Report in his decision, which was issued in July of 2017 and explains that all tokens sold on Ethereum-based platforms, like both REcoin and Diamond, were securities.

Dearie, however, stated that the laws were meant to be interpreted flexibly and that not all ICOs could be considered securities. The same could be said for the My Big Coin case, as the classification of the cryptocurrency as a commodity is confined to the case at hand and does not extend to other crypto assets currently available on the market.",Law & Justice,0.9862
2018/9/28,SEC Charges Forex Broker for Illegal Securities Swaps Involving Bitcoin,"In what seems like the first coordinated strike from government agencies, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have taken action against a securities broker for violating federal laws in connection with security-based swaps funded by bitcoin.

On September 27, 2018, the SEC announced that it had filed charges at a U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against Marshall Islands-based securities company 1pool Ltd., also known as 1Broker, and its Austria-based CEO Patrick Brunner for trading security swaps to American investors and others across the world without meeting the ""discretionary investment thresholds required"" by federal securities law.

The SEC further claims that 1Broker was fraudulently issuing swaps as it was not a registered ""securities-based swaps dealer,"" and it also failed to transact on a registered national exchange.

Commenting on the claims, Shamoil Shipchandler, director of the SEC's Fort Worth regional office, said the SEC would protect U.S. investors on any platform regardless of the currency used in the transaction.

""International companies that transact with U.S. investors cannot circumvent compliance with the federal securities laws by using cryptocurrency.""

The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions, penalties and ""disgorgement plus interest"" against 1Broker and its CEO.

Responding to the SEC's allegation, 1Broker assured customers of the safety of their funds and said they were ready to cooperate with the SEC.

The CFTC filed a similar complaint against 1Broker for illegally offering off-exchange, transactions, not registering as a Futures Commission Merchants (FCM), and failure to implement anti-money laundering and supervisory features.

The statement from the CFTC reads in part:

""Entities required to be registered as FCMs such as 1pool, are required by Commission Regulations to diligently supervise all activities of their officers, employees, and agents relating to their business as an FCM, including the handling of customer accounts, and to implement and maintain adequate supervisory systems and procedures.""

The Federal Bureau of Investigation followed this up with a seizure of the 1Broker.com domain name. The Bureau claims the domain was taken down after a U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found probable cause that it's in violation of federal laws.

2018/10/17,Class Action Suits Launched Against Cryptocurrency Mining Investment Company,"The law offices of Pomerantz LLP in New York have filed a series of civil suits against MGT Capital Investment and its executive officers on behalf of several of the trading firm’s past or present customers. The suits allege that between October 9, 2015 and September 7, 2018, the company violated laws set forth by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that resulted in damages to several of its clients.

Between 2013 and April 2016, MGT described itself as “engaged in the business of acquiring, developing and monetizing social assets in the online and mobile gaming space, as well as the social casino industry.” In May 2016, however, the company revamped itself as a cybersecurity firm and developed bitcoin mining operations in both Washington state and Sweden. It was during this time that the company’s shares rose to some of their highest levels.

Stephen Schaeffer is the chief operating officer of MGT. Speaking with Bitcoin Magazine, he said that he believes any monetary losses suffered by clients are relative to the bearish conditions being witnessed in today’s crypto market.

“The bitcoin mining market has been tough,” he commented. “There’s no sugarcoating that. Our share prices exploded with the price of bitcoin, just as the difficulty rate for miners drastically increased. As bitcoin dropped, so did the value of our shares, but for miners, things got even worse because the difficulty rate stayed quite high. That means we’ve been spending considerably more in energy costs than we were last year.”

He continued, “I believe we hear too much redirect from miners on how great mining is and has been. Well, that’s true for a longer time frame. I have personally been mining since 2012 with an average monthly profit of about 15 percent. This, however, is not true in 2018. Profitability has been very marginal, and, for those not paying the absolute lowest prices for power and running lean operations, it has resulted in losses or even the closing of operations for some.”

Schaeffer contends that the company has taken steps to address some of these financial issues. MGT is currently working to move its miners from its Swedish facility, where costs have been too high and unpredictable, to the U.S. The company is negotiating with a number of locations in the country’s central northern region and anticipates relocating its mining operations back onto American soil very soon.

But the plaintiffs tell a different story. In 2015, Barry Honig, a leading small cap investor, and several of his associates purchased shares in MGT and obtained control over its management team. The suits claim that Honig forced the company into a “misleading stock promotion” that sought to drive up the prices and respective trading volumes of the company’s stock holdings. Honig is accused of later dumping his own shares for a serious profit while taking “numerous steps” to conceal his team’s involvement.

Lawyers representing the plaintiffs also say that Honig repeatedly made false and misleading claims regarding MGT’s operations and compliance policies, and that customers were never informed of the illegal pump-and-dump scheme. In addition, they say the defendants have a long history of engaging in illegal conduct relating to the sale and purchase of securities, and that they exercised inappropriate control over the company and placed MGT in danger of being delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.

While Shaeffer says he cannot comment on ongoing litigation, he did state, “Mr. Honig has no role within MGT other than being an early investor years ago. In fact, MGT was sued by Mr. Honig in a claim that was dropped with prejudice. I joined the company as an employee after Mr. Honig was no longer an investor. Mr. Honig has never had the authority to speak for the company and he’s had no input into the company.”

In September 2016, MGT's CEO Robert Ladd received a subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) demanding “certain information” from the company. The commission filed a complaint against MGT two years later and subsequently published a report stating that executives were involved in the illegal pump-and-dump system. As a result, shares in the company fell to less than 40 cents each, roughly 91 percent less than where they had been during the company’s peak period.

“We made public the SEC subpoena in an effort to be fully transparent to our shareholders,” Schaeffer said. “The nature and intent of the document was a request for information regarding a group of specific accredited investors who had invested in the public company prior to 2016. There were no specific claims or allegations made at that time, just a request for information regarding communications between the company and these particular investors.”

An original version of this article incorrectly stated that MGT received a subpoena in 2016. The article has since been amended to convey that the company's CEO received the subpoena.",Law & Justice,-0.9544
2018/10/27,Crypto is Property: Chinese Court Upholds Citizens Rights to Own Bitcoin,"The Shenzhen Court of International Arbitration (SCIA) has recently affirmed that cryptocurrencies, specifically bitcoin and several of its hard forks, are considered legal property and Chinese citizens have a right to own and transfer them.

The SCIA recently published an analysis of a contract dispute over WeChat, describing the legal proceedings of a case in which one individual managed nearly $500,000 worth of crypto assets on behalf of another private individual. The manager then refused to return these assets after their client dealt with a third party.

The defendant in this case argued that the whole arrangement between the three parties was invalid, as bitcoin, ICOs and other cryptocurrencies are not recognized as currencies under Chinese law.

The arbitrator sided against this reasoning, ruling instead that the holding of these assets as property is not itself illegal, so it is not illegal to include the transfer of crypto assets as a binding clause in business agreements. Further, the arbitrator was careful to note that bitcoin “is not a currency issued by the monetary authority nor electronic legal tender,” though this should not preclude it from being protected as personal property.

“Bitcoin is not a legal currency, but it is no doubt that it deserves protection by law as property. Bitcoin has property attributes...economic value, and can bring economic benefits,” the court claims.

The case only involved bitcoin and two of its hard forks, bitcoin cash and bitcoin diamond, and, therefore, arguably does not rule out further legal disputes in the future over other cryptocurrencies not derived from the original Bitcoin protocol.

It’s important to note that the SCIA is not a lawmaking body itself, and the arbitrator in question does not have any influence over the future status of crypto assets as a legal currency in Chinese jurisdictions. Nevertheless, this does set a judicial precedent for citizens to treat crypto assets as legal property.

Although the Chinese legal space often seems opaque to outside audiences, this case should serve as a clear example to show that the courts are not intractably hostile to the rights of private citizens over bitcoin ownership.",Law & Justice,0.9761
2018/11/2,"Winklevoss Twins Sue Charlie Shrem For Allegedly Stealing 5,000 Bitcoin","The Winklevoss twins have filed a lawsuit against bitcoin investor Charlie Shrem, alleging that Shrem “stole” 5,000 bitcoins from them in 2012.

According to a recent report released by the New York Times, Charlie Shrem has made several large purchases over the past year, including multiple real estate properties, luxury cars, powerboats and a $2 million house.

Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have since filed a civil suit against Shrem, alleging that these recent purchases were made using bitcoins Shrem stole from the pair in 2012.

When Shrem was arrested in 2014, his company BitInstant also collapsed, and he was left with few remaining liquid assets. Since his release in 2016, he publicly claimed to have spent several months as a dishwasher before re-involving himself with crypto-related projects.

Before his troubles with the criminal justice system, however, Shrem was hired by the Winklevoss twins in 2012 to build up a stockpile of cryptocurrencies, being given access to hundreds of thousands of dollars to purchase bitcoin.

Many of these transactions went off without a hitch; however, the twins allege, Shrem came up short for more than $60,000 worth of bitcoin. At the contemporary prices of $12.50 each, this roughly came out to 5,000 bitcoins.

In today’s market, however, such a sum is worth roughly $30 million. What was once a minor point of contention between the two parties amidst a greater tumultuous partnership is now large enough in the Winklevoss’ eyes to warrant recompense.

Not surprisingly, Shrem and his legal team think otherwise.

“Winklevoss Capital Fund has brought an utterly baseless civil lawsuit against Charlie Shrem. The lawsuit erroneously alleges that about six years ago Charlie essentially misappropriated thousands of bitcoins. Nothing could be further from the truth. Charlie plans to vigorously defend himself and quickly clear his name,” Brian Klein, a representative from Shrem’s legal team, told Bitcoin Magazine.

Given the Bitcoin blockchain’s public nature, the truth is likely in the transactions. An investigator hired by the twins, for example, claims that transactions for the missing coins in question can easily be traced on the public ledger. In 2013, he alleged that these bitcoins were sent to addresses controlled by Shrem and then redirected into other wallet services.

It is unclear at this time if this civil suit will see a jury, or if the parties involved will reach a settlement beforehand.

2018/11/9,Early Win for Shrem: Judge Unfreezes Assets in Winklevoss Lawsuit,"In a short-term win for bitcoin advocate Charlie Shrem, a federal judge has lifted the freeze on Shrem’s financial accounts in an ongoing legal battle against the Winklevoss twins.

Shrem’s financial accounts and assets were temporarily frozen via an attachment order following the suit’s initial filing. The order allowed the U.S. Marshall for the Southern District to freeze Shrem’s assets, instructing cryptocurrency companies like Coinbase and Xapo and legacy financial institutions to freeze Shrem’s assets up to $30 million, the amount the Winklevosses are seeking in damages.

However, following a hearing on Thursday, November 8, 2019, presiding Judge Jed S. Rakoff issued a court order lifting the freeze.

“After careful consideration, the Court denies plaintiff’s motion to confirm the order of attachment and therefore lifts the attachment currently in place effective immediately,” the order reads.

The document concludes by saying that an opinion will be issued “in due course” explaining why a freeze was unnecessary for the initial proceedings to continue.

Earlier this month, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss of the Gemini Exchange in New York filed a suit against Charlie Shrem for 5,000 BTC after Shrem reportedly made several high-value purchases following his release from prison.

Shrem has claimed he went to prison penniless, reportedly working as a dishwasher for several months after his release before returning to the bitcoin space. Shrem’s self-reported poverty has led the community to question where he dug up the funds for his luxury shopping spree.

The Winklevosses believe that these purchases were made with bitcoin Shrem stole from the twins when they hired him to manage their initial cryptocurrency investments in 2012.

The working relationship was troubled when Shrem allegedly mismanaged roughly $60,000 of bitcoin. At the time, bitcoin was worth approximately $12.50, so the $60,000 would be equal to about 5,000 BTC. The twins say they’ve hired a private investigator who states that, in 2013, the missing bitcoins were traced to several wallet addresses owned by Shrem before being redirected to other accounts.

Shrem’s lawyer Brian Klein asserts that the Winklevoss twins’ claims are baseless, and he’s confident in Shrem’s innocence. In a recently filed motion of defense, Klein writes:

“Plaintiff Winklevoss Capital Fund, LLC’s (“WCF’s”) prejudgment attachment and underlying lawsuit are predicated and built on the demonstrably false premise that defendant Charlie Shrem (“Shrem”) misappropriated $61,000 of WCF’s money in 2012, purchased 5,000 bitcoins with those funds, moved those bitcoins around on December 31, 2012 (and subsequently), and then years later after his release from prison went on a spending spree with them, but WCF’s case collapses on itself because those 5,000 bitcoins were not owned by Shrem. The scandalous and fantastical story WCF is advancing is nonsense.”

The document explains that the 5,000 BTC in question were owned by a separate party, who for privacy purposes, Klein refers to as “Mr. X.” It further states that Mr. X is “identified in email communications between him and Shrem (and others)” discussing the 5,000 bitcoins. Copies of the emails were filed with the motion that allegedly suggest Mr. X transferred the coins to a cold storage wallet account in Shrem’s name on December 31, 2012.

The document goes on to say, “This lawsuit and application for prejudgment attachment can only be characterized as an ambush money-grab designed to cripple Shrem financially.” It further explains that the Winklevoss twins have failed to provide any substantial evidence showing that Shrem attempted to defraud them purposely.

While the judge has freed up Shrem’s funds, the case is ongoing, and it will have an official trial by jury on April 8, 2019.",Law & Justice,0.4588
2018/11/9,"Investor Lawsuit Brought Against AT&T, T-Mobile for SIM Swapping Hacks","Leading cryptocurrency investor law firm Silver Miller Law has filed suit against cell phone giants AT&T and T-Mobile on behalf of several digital asset investors who were victims of the identity-theft tactic known as “SIM swapping.” The suit alleges that both companies possessed flaws in their security systems and failed to properly train their employees to work against hackers seeking to gain access to users’ smartphones.

SIM swapping occurs when a hacker gathers information on a potential victim, such as their phone password, answers to their security questions and their financial holdings. Once they have the data they need, the hacker will contact the person’s cell phone provider and claim that their SIM card has been lost or damaged and request that a new one be activated, with the end goal of accessing the victim’s finances — in this case, cryptocurrency.

The lawyers at Silver Miller Law claim that many of their clients had their crypto wallets drained via SIM swapping techniques, including one individual — an AT&T holder — who had roughly $621,000 stolen despite the phone company’s assurances that security had been beefed up following an earlier hack attempt on his account. Two other instances involved T-Mobile clients, who were ultimately robbed of $400,000 and $250,000 respectively.

This is not the only SIM jacking case brought against AT&T; the mobile carrier is also the subject of a separate $224 million lawsuit brought on by Michael Terpin, the founder of angel investment group BitAngels. Terpin claims that the company’s weak security protocols led to his loss of roughly $24 million in crypto funds through two separate SIM swap attacks.

In a deposition filed in August, Terpin claims that the hackers obtained access to his phone number with the help of an AT&T customer service representative. The hackers were then able to access his cryptocurrency wallet and steal funds.

Terpin states, “What AT&T did was like a hotel giving a thief with a fake ID a room key and a key to the room safe to steal jewelry in the safe from the rightful owner.” He is now seeking roughly $200 million in damages.

Silver Miller Law has developed a reputation in the space for bringing investor-led lawsuits to court. Notable judgments and settlements in the firm’s history include Liu v. the Florida-based cryptocurrency exchange Cryptsy, in which roughly $50 million (approximately 11,300 BTC) was ordered returned to the company’s many traders and investors. It has also filed suits against Coinbase for its alleged mishandling of December 2017’s bitcoin cash listing.",Law & Justice,-0.9001
2018/11/12,Trader Jailed and Fined Over $1 Million for Bitcoin and Litecoin Fraud Scheme,"The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued a press release on Friday, November 9, 2018, stating that it had fined Arizona resident Joseph Kim for perpetrating a fraudulent cryptocurrency trading scheme against his former employer and other investors. The same day, a District Court in the Northern District of Illinois sentenced Kim to 15 months on wire fraud charges.

Misappropriating Employer's Funds
According to the release, Kim had misappropriated his employer's funds between September and November 2017. Kim, who was employed by a Chicago-based trading firm at the time, had transferred the company's tokens from the cryptocurrency exchange where they were kept into his wallet address.

When questioned about the illegal transfers, Kim falsely stated that the platform's security issues were the reason why the tokens were moved. The firm discovered the misappropriation of funds in November 2017; by then, Kim had lost approximately $601,000 of the company's funds. The company subsequently fired him.

Defrauding Investors
Kim then went out to solicit investment funds from unsuspecting investors, telling them he had left his former employer willingly to start a company of his own. After falsely informing investors he had a ""low-risk virtual currency arbitrage strategy,"" he got at least five investors, who gave him approximately $545,000 to invest in the crypto market.

Kim made poor investment decisions, leading to a total wipeout of his clients’ investments. Again, he concealed the losses, going so far as to falsify account statements sent to investors, which reflected profits where there were none.

Fines
The CFTC fined Kim $1.146 million, to be paid as restitution to his former employer and his investors. The agency has also imposed on Kim a permanent trading and registration ban for crypto trading and for soliciting of funds.

Director of Enforcement James McDonald calls the order issued against Kim evidence of the agency's “commitment to actively police the virtual currency markets and protect the public interest.”

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also been busy ramping up its enforcement against fraudulent schemes in the industry.

Just last week, the SEC charged crypto exchange EtherDelta with running an “unregistered national securities exchange.”

The agency also went after TokenLot LLC and Crypto Asset Management LP for registration failures in September 2018.

Its brokerage arm, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), had a taste of the crypto industry, when it went after publicly traded company Rocky Mountain Ayre Inc. (RMTN) and its CEO, Timothy Tilton Ayre, charging him with the “unlawful distribution of an unregistered security.”",Law & Justice,-0.9732
2018/11/13,Bitmain Sues Anonymous Hacker Over $5.5 Million Theft,"Chinese mining giant Bitmain is suing an anonymous hacker that allegedly stole $5.5 million in cryptocurrency last April from the company’s account on the digital exchange Binance.

The hacker’s identity is still unknown, and he’s described only as “John Doe” in official court documents, which were filed in accordance with the lawsuit on November 7, 2018, with the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington in Seattle. The documents state that the hacker managed to take over the company’s Binance account, then use bitcoin stored in the account to purchase ether tokens. These tokens were utilized to buy and manipulate the price of an altcoin known as MANA coin (MANA).

John Doe then transferred the MANA into a separate Binance account they controlled. The documents explain, “Upon further information and belief, John Doe took his/her market manipulating and theft scam a step further by essentially reversing the same orchestrated trades between Bitmain’s wallet and John Doe’s wallet using a deflated MANA price. While accessing Bitmain’s digital wallet without authority, John Doe placed an order to sell MANA out of Bitmain’s digital wallet at a deflated price. At the same time, John Doe placed a purchase order for MANA at that deflated price from John Doe’s Binance wallet.”

They continue to say, “Binance’s automated system matched the deflated MANA sell order with the deflated MANA purchase order and executed the trade, and John Doe obtained significant gains at the expense of Bitmain. As a result, John Doe benefitted twice from transferring MANA into and out of Bitmain’s digital wallet.”

Once these steps were completed, the court filing reports that the hacker transferred all the crypto funds from the theft into a wallet on Bittrex, a competing digital asset exchange. John Doe then cashed in on the profits and disappeared.

The documents say the hacker willingly and knowingly accessed a protected computer without appropriate permission with the intention of defrauding Bitmain.

“By means of such conduct, John Doe furthered the intended fraud and obtained things of value, specifically bitcoin and other digital assets, causing a loss to Bitmain exceeding $5,500,000,” the filing states.

Specifically, the documents assert that the defendant’s actions are a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), and that Bitmain is entitled to specific damages under the Act’s provisions.

It was reported last month that losses incurred by hacks on digital exchanges during the first nine months of 2018 exceed the total losses of 2017 by roughly 250 percent and that approximately $950 million has been stolen this year.",Law & Justice,-0.9671
2018/11/13,Ripple Files to Move Securities Lawsuit from State to Federal Court,"Ripple’s legal team in their ongoing securities suit is attempting a new tack: to have the claim proceed at the federal level.

In a move that legal commentator Jake Chervinsky described as “seriously crafty,” Ripple has filed a formal notice-of-removal motion to have their most recent securities suit, Zakinov et al v. Ripple, tried in a federal court rather than at the state level.  

In the notice of removal, the defendants, which include Ripple and its CEO Brad Garlinghouse, among others, request that the court “remove the … civil action, and all claims and causes of action therein, from the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Mateo, to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.”

The class action is a consolidation of three separate suits filed by Vladi Zakinov, David Oconer and Avner Greenwald “on behalf of all California citizens who purchased or otherwise acquired XRP from January 1, 2013 to the present.” It claims that since Ripple has failed to register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), XRP has been sold as an unregistered security, and the combined class action is seeking nearly $17 million in damages.

Swamped with legal troubles, Ripple has sustained several legal challenges to their sale of XRP tokens, with many alleging that these token sales constitute securities fraud. Although Ripple has yet to face any serious consequences as a result of these battles, facing three securities suits in a single year could prove to be a serious strain on Ripple’s resources.

This latest attempt to plead their case at the federal level may set vital precedent, if successful. A federal clarification on the interaction of securities laws and token sales could shut down future cases before they even begin.

This appears to be the pretext for attempting to move this suit to a different court system, at least. As Chervinsky went on to elaborate, a suit argued on Ripple’s behalf in the state of California could also serve as a precedent to stop the tide of frivolous securities lawsuits levied at Ripple.

At this early stage in the fight, Ripple’s legal team could also believe “they have better odds of winning in federal court than in state court (or else they wouldn’t be trying so hard to remove the case),” Chervinsky continued.

To be clear, the notice of removal still needs to be approved by the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Mateo, before it is bumped up to the federal circuit. Following the notice, the plaintiffs submitted a filing to request that the case persist at the state level.",Law & Justice,0.0772
2018/11/21,Colorado State Commissioner Issues New Cease-and-Desist Orders Against Four Crypto Firms,"Colorado Securities Commissioner Gerald Rome has issued a new batch of cease-and-desist orders against unregistered Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) operating in the state, taking the total number of signed orders against ICOs in Colorado to 18. Today's orders follow last week's order issued by the North Dakota's financial regulators against a Russian-based ICO that promoted unregistered securities by impersonating Liechtenstein-based Union Bank AG.

Per an official notice from the regulator, Rome signed the new orders against Global Pay Net, Credits LLC, CrowdShare Mining and CyberSmart Coin Invest for allegedly publishing misleading statements on their websites with false promises to defraud investors.

Global Pay Net markets its native currency “GLPN Coins” to Colorado residents, which clearly states that the ownership of the tokens represents “full-value assets that represent one’s share in the business,” while promising investors 80 percent of the company's profits. Credits, also solicits investments for its currency, known as “Cred (CX)” which it claims would “be worth tangible value,” while promising investors a future windfall.

CrowdShare Mining and CyberSmart Coin Invest both promote the idea that owning their cryptocurrency would offer benefits to the investors. CrowdShare Mining promises investors 50 percent of the profits while fraudulently stating that its tokens would be mined through renewable energy sources. CyberSmart claims to use robots to trade on popular crypto exchanges where it has uncovered a secret model for making huge profits. The company also promises investors about 20 to 35 percent returns monthly.

Commissioner Rome commented on the development stating that the number of orders issued against ICOs should serve as a “red flag to all investors that there is a real risk that the ICO you are considering is a fraud.”

He went on to add:

“Our investigations show that there are fraudsters who will simply create a fake ICO to steal investors’ money, or spoof a legitimate ICO to trick investors into wrongfully paying them.

The orders are the results of the investigations carried out by the ICO Task Force set up in May 2018 within the Department of Regulatory Agencies (DORA) to look into unlawful activities targeting cryptocurrency investors in Colorado.",Law & Justice,0.9874
2018/11/28,A First: U.S. Treasury Makes Bitcoin Addresses Focal Point in Sanctions,"For the first time, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has traced illicit bitcoin activity to the public addresses of two sanctioned individuals.

According to a November 28, 2018, press release, the department is bringing action against Ali Khorashadizadeh and Mohammad Ghorbaniyan for their alleged involvement in the SamSam ransomware scheme. The two men reportedly helped the hackers behind SamSam convert millions of dollars of ransomed bitcoin to Iranian rials.

“As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of the designated persons that are in the possession or control of U.S. persons or within or transiting the United States are blocked, and U.S. persons generally are prohibited from dealing with them,” the release states.

These charges coincide with the U.S. Department of Justice’s indictment of Faramarz Shahi Savandi and Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri, the ringleaders behind the 34-month long SamSam ransomware attack. Beginning in 2015, the ransomware affected some 200 international entities, including hospitals and government departments in California, Colorado, Georgia and Kansas. The malicious actors used the ransomware to gain administrative control over the victims’ IT servers and sensitive documents, and they leveraged this control to demand bitcoin as ransom.

Khorashadizadeh and Ghorbaniyan helped Savandi and Mansour process some $6 million in extorted payments. Tracing the illicit activity back to Khorashadizadeh and Ghorbaniyan’s primary Bitcoin public addresses, the OFAC found that the two men have executed roughly 7,000 transactions across 40 exchanges since 2013. The department believes that a significant sum of the 6,000 bitcoin either man has handled is related to the SamSam ransomware scheme, indicating that they converted these funds into Iranian rials and deposited them into bank accounts on behalf of Khorashadizadeh and Ghorbaniyan.

The Bitcoin addresses in question are as follows: 149w62rY42aZBox8fGcmqNsXUzSStKeq8C and 1AjZPMsnmpdK2Rv9KQNfMurTXinscVro9V.

“Treasury is targeting digital currency exchangers who have enabled Iranian cyber actors to profit from extorting digital ransom payments from their victims. As Iran becomes increasingly isolated and desperate for access to U.S. dollars, it is vital that virtual currency exchanges, peer-to-peer exchangers, and other providers of digital currency services harden their networks against these illicit schemes. We are publishing digital currency addresses to identify illicit actors operating in the digital currency space. Treasury will aggressively pursue Iran and other rogue regimes attempting to exploit digital currencies and weaknesses in cyber and AML/CFT safeguards to further their nefarious objectives,” Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Sigal Mandelker said in a statement.

The release continues to state that “persons that engage in transactions with Khorashadizadeh and Ghorbaniyan could be subject to secondary sanctions.”",Law & Justice,0.0516
2018/11/29,AriseBank CEO Charged in $4 Million Alleged ICO Scam,"Jared Rice Sr., CEO of the Dallas-based bank AriseBank, was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Wednesday, November 28, 2018, and charged with six counts of securities fraud and wire fraud. Rice is accused of scamming investors out of more than $4 million through a cryptocurrency scam that promised federally insured accounts and brand-name credit cards.

Earlier this year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) regional office in Fort Worth, Texas, received an emergency court order to stop AriseBank’s initial coin offering (ICO) for the cryptocurrency AriseCoin, which Rice falsely claimed had raised a whopping $600 million. According to the court filing, Rice reportedly lied to investors, saying that the bank — which he called the “first decentralized banking platform” — could offer customers FDIC-insured accounts, as well as traditional banking services such as Visa-brand credit and debit cards.

Erin Nealy Cox — the U.S. District Attorney for the Northern District of Texas — states that AriseBank was not FDIC insured, nor did it have the authority to conduct banking operations in Texas. It also did not have an official partnership with Visa.

Rice spoke of AriseBank’s allegedly non-existent benefits online and through press releases while spending investor funds on hotel stays, clothing, meals, Uber rides, a family law attorney and guardian ad litem. Prosecutors also accused Rice of spending the funds on his girlfriend.

Overall, Rice raised roughly $4.25 million from investors who used fiat currency, bitcoin, ether and litecoin funds between the months of June 2017 and January 2018 to buy into AriseCoin.

All the while, Rice ultimately failed to disclose to investors that he had previously pled guilty to state felony charges of tampering with government records for forging a Texas Secretary of State Incorporation document and for stealing funds through a prior internet business scam. Rice is presently on probation for these offenses.

Cox commented, “My office is committed to enforcing the rule of law in the cryptocurrency space. The Northern District of Texas will not tolerate this sort of flagrant deception — online or off.”

Rice faces up to 120 years in prison if convicted. Assistant U.S. attorneys Mary Walters and Sid Mody are prosecuting the case, but a trial date has not been set.

Phony ICOs have become a major problem over the past year. It is estimated that approximately $500 million of investors’ funds have been lost to fraudulent ICOs in 2018 alone, while the SEC’s list of ICO cases is growing regularly.

One similar case involves Brooklyn-based businessman Maksim Zaslavskiy, who recently pled guilty in a New York federal court to conspiracy to commit securities fraud in connection with the ICOs REcoin Group Foundation, LLC (REcoin) and DRC World Inc., also known as Diamond Reserve Club (Diamond).

Zaslavskiy touted the ICOs as being backed by real estate and diamonds respectively, when, in fact, he had purchased neither, and the certificates he sent to his investors were not backed by the blockchain. He’s currently facing up to five years in prison.",Law & Justice,-0.9898
2018/11/29,U.S. District Judge Turns Back SEC Request Regarding ICO,"A new development has arisen in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) efforts to regulate ICOs: a District Judge has turned back a request for an injunction.

According to a recent legal briefing, San Diego District Judge Gonzalo Curiel has been presiding over a case between the SEC and the startup company Blockvest. On November 27, 2018, although Judge Curiel had previously “granted the SEC’s ex parte request for a temporary restraining order and froze the assets involved in the ICO,” he has now stated that the SEC couldn’t demonstrate that buyers of Blockvest’s ICO expected to receive a profit.

The SEC’s regulations regarding ICOs are a tricky and largely unresolved legal area, but this case and others have explicitly cited one 1946 court case: SEC vs. W.J. Howey Co. This case first codified into law that certain assets can be considered securities, and become subject to securities regulations, based on the way that sellers and customers handle them.

One of the critical criteria for an offering such as an ICO to become a security under the Howey statute is for customers to demonstrate an expectation that they will eventually make more money from the purchase. According to Curiel’s recent comments, customers of the Blockvest ICO were under no such illusion.

Curiel’s comments by themselves do not constitute a legal verdict, and the case is by no means sealed. The briefing went on to state that former representatives of the SEC believe that this case “sends a message to the agency that courts are paying close attention to the question of whether digital tokens fit the legal definition of a security.”

In other words, this is a concrete example of the court system showing a willingness to treat ICOs as if they are not necessarily tied to securities regulations. Legal commentators on the briefing included the sentiment that “it was obvious that the judge had studied the facts and the applicable precedent” as it applied to the case.

For now, Judge Curiel’s reversal will mean that Blockvest’s assets are no longer tied up by the initial freeze order that the SEC was granted, and it will be better equipped to mount a defense should the SEC bring more charges against them.

“It is an extraordinary challenge for defendants facing freeze orders and restraining orders obtained ex parte by the government,” said Stanley Morris, representing the defendants. He added that “our clients are now free to defend themselves through trial and look forward to being vindicated.”",Law & Justice,0.9842
2018/12/12,Prosecutors Seek 10-Year Jail Sentence for Karpeles Over Mt. Gox Embezzlement,"Former Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles has run into trouble in the Japanese legal system, and prosecutors are pursuing a 10-year jail sentence for alleged embezzlement during his tenure at Mt. Gox.

According to a local Japanese news outlet, Karpeles is under indictment for embezzling 341 million yen ($3 million USD) of customer funds into his own personal account. The indictment apparently also alleges that Karpeles “manipulated data on his company's trading system to pad the balance.”

As Mt. Gox was based in Tokyo, it has been the responsibility of the Japanese legal system to prosecute Karpeles, just as it placed Mt. Gox into bankruptcy proceedings in 2014. By the end of the company’s shutdown, they’d lost 48 billion yen worth of bitcoin and 2.8 billion yen in fiat. Karpeles has claimed that such losses were due to a hack.

Mark Karpeles is a notorious name in the crypto space, a long-term player who has been involved with some of the most infamous business ventures of bitcoin’s first major price spike. In Mt. Gox’s heyday in 2013, it was the largest functional crypto exchange.

In addition to his stewardship of Mt. Gox, of particular note to Karpeles career is his alleged bankrolling of the Silk Road, the now-defunct darknet marketplace. As federal agents began trying to take down the website for narcotics trafficking violations, agents on the case directly notified Karpeles who was able to cover his involvement.

Now, however, Karpeles seems to have run into more direct legal trouble. In Tokyo, prosecutors alleged that the French-born Karpeles “diverted company funds to such uses as investing in a software development business for personal interest"" and ""played a great role in totally destroying the confidence of bitcoin users.""

In response to this, Karpeles pleaded innocent to these charges in July 2017, saying during his first hearing that “I swear to God I am not guilty.” The trial is apparently set to move forward in the immediate future, with unclear prospects for Karpeles.",Law & Justice,-0.4818
2019/1/22,Top Officials at Two Korean Cryptocurrency Exchanges Face Fraud Indictments,"Several of South Korea’s top crypto exchanges have found themselves in hot water, with executives at a couple of exchanges facing criminal charges and jail time.

According to a news report on the Korean website Blockinpress, the CEO of Komid, a Korean crypto exchange, has received a three-year prison sentence for committing fraud against investors by artificially inflating the exchange’s actual trading volume. Another company executive also received a sentence of two years for his role in these crimes.

The report claims that Komid fabricated over 5 million accounts to falsify trade orders and drum up fake volume. The scam allowed the executives to net roughly $44M (50 billion won) in fees from trades that were executed against the fake orders. This figure doesn’t take into account the business the exchange might have generated from extra, legitimate customers they might have attracted by posting these fraudulent figures.

The judge stated that CEO Hyunsuk Choi “has repeatedly committed fraud for many unspecified number of victims for a long period of time,” and expressed concern about possible ramifications on public confidence in the industry.

Komid is not the only Korean company to have been involved in scandal recently, as UPbit also saw its executives arrested on similar charges of artificial inflation.

As reported in the Korea Times, these arrests involved not only the direct operators of the exchange itself, but also its parent company, Dunamu.

According to the Korea Times, “two top-level officers and one employee of UPbit, including Dunamu’s board director chairman surnamed Song” were indicted on these charges, as these falsified exchange numbers allowed UPbit to rake in more than 120 billion won ($106.8 million).

The prosecutors have evidently discovered two severe instances of this volume falsification, dating from October to December of 2017, and then again on December 18, 2018. Allegedly, the executives of UPbit used a bot program to falsify some 254 trillion won ($225 billion) worth of trades.

Officials at UPbit, for their part, have completely denied these allegations. In their public statement, they claimed that they “have provided liquidity to [their] corporate account and have not benefited or traded in this process,” adding that during the period of October to December 2017, “the company provided liquidity to the company’s corporate account in order to stabilize the trading market at the beginning of the service opening.”

The Korea Times indicated that none of the accused parties at UPbit has been taken into police custody yet.

Prosecutors in South Korea are well-accustomed to dealing with all manner of scams and fraudulent activities in their nation’s crypto space. Not only is their closest neighbor, North Korea, a direct sponsor of some of the most ambitious crypto-hacking groups, but it has also been scant weeks since the last time a South Korean exchange made headlines for defrauding its millions of customers.",Law & Justice,-0.9679
2019/2/5,Court Grants QuadrigaCX Bankruptcy Protection,"Today, February 5, 2019, a court in Nova Scotia, Canada, granted bankruptcy protection under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) to the embattled Vancouver-based cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX. The court appointed Ernst & Young as monitors to help the exchange locate any funds it could use to reimburse users and ordered a 30-day stay of proceedings.

The exchange initially made the news on January 14, 2019, when the company announced its CEO Gerald Cotten had died in India on December 9, 2018, from complications from Crohn's disease. News website CoinDesk obtained what appears to be a copy from the Indian government of Gerald Cotten’s death certificate, although his name is misspelled.

On January 31, 2019, the exchange went offline posting a statement that they had filed for creditor protection.

More than a month after Cotten’s death, the exchange announced that he had the only access to the exchange’s cold storage, effectively locking up the exchange’s funds in offline wallets that, allegedly, no one else at the company has access to. Cotten’s widow, Jennifer Robertson, has reportedly hired a security expert to hack into the computer.

In its petition to the Nova Scotia court, QuadrigaCX claimed they didn’t have access to wallets containing $137 million USD in cryptocurrency owned by an estimated 115,000 users. The affidavit claims that QuadrigaCX has 363,000 registered users and owes approximately $190 million USD. Court documents show that one user alone had a balance of approximately $70 million CDN ($53 million USD).

Professional services firm Ernst & Young said they would focus on finding out whether there are any reserves in cold storage and, if there are, how to access them.

In court today, the lawyers for QuadrigaCX said they are considering selling the exchange to pay off funds that are owed. Maurice Chiasson, a lawyer representing QuadrigaCX, has said that, currently, there are several payment processors that hold funds from the exchange.

A number of affected users have retained lawyers and formed class actions to seek restitution. Attorneys for the applicants now have five days to serve the 115,000 customers owed funds with notice of the order.",Law & Justice,-0.8519
2019/2/5,Hacker Gets 10 Years in First SIM-Swapping Sentencing in the U.S.,"According to a recent report, Joel Ortiz, the 20-year-old student from Boston who was indicted by prosecutors in Santa Clara, California, has been sentenced to 10 years in prison in what is believed to be the very first SIM swapping conviction in the United States.

Ortiz was charged last year on 28 counts involving various computer-related violations and crimes concerning information law. Ortiz took control of the identities of over 20 people, stealing a total of $5 million in cryptocurrencies with his SIM swapping technique. He pleaded guilty and accepted the plea deal of 10 years jail time.

How SIM Swapping Works
SIM swapping is a technique that involves a criminal contacting the service provider of a target victim. The hacker will then use personal information acquired about a potential target to persuade the service provider to effect a phone number transfer from the current SIM card to one owned by the hacker. As soon as the swap has been executed, the hacker can request sensitive information including verification codes, one-time passwords and two-factor authentication entries, which are usually sent to a user’s mobile phone as part of a successful porting process. SIM swappers are known to target high-security online domains such as social media accounts, email addresses, bank accounts and cryptocurrency wallets.

Other High Profile SIM Swapping Cases
Various SIM swapping cases have been reported lately, including Dawson Bakies, a tech-savvy criminal who used the same technique to make off with thousands of dollars in cryptocurrencies from over 50 victims across the U.S.

Per a press release from the Manhattan District Attorney's office, Bakies has been charged by a grand jury in the state of New York, and he currently faces a 52-count charge, including computer tampering, grand larceny, and identity theft. Bakies pleaded not guilty to the charges leveled against him, and he was subsequently released on a $100,000 bail.

Last year, American crypto investor and businessman Michael Terpin sued AT&T for $233.8 million over fraud and gross negligence on the part of the service provider which resulted in a SIM swapping operation that cost him millions of dollars in digital assets.

Three million tokens were stolen from Terpin’s crypto account, with a total worth of $23 million, at the time. He is also seeking an additional $200 million in punitive damages.",Law & Justice,-0.9829
2019/2/13,First QuadrigaCX Monitor Report: $460k in BTC “Inadvertently” Sent to Cold Wallet,"According to the latest court documents in the ongoing QuadrigaCX case, the exchange sent roughly $470,000 CAD (approximately $355, 000 USD) worth of bitcoin from a hot wallet to a cold-storage wallet on February 6, 2019.

Ernst & Young’s first report as monitor of scrutinized Canadian bitcoin exchange QuadrigaCX (QCX) complicates the story the exchange has given for its lack of access to company funds following the death of its founder and CEO, Gerald Cotten.

The court document states, “On February 6, 2019, Quadriga inadvertently transferred 103 bitcoins valued at approximately $468,675 to Quadriga cold wallets which the Company is currently unable to access. The Monitor is working with Management to retrieve this cryptocurrency from the various cold wallets, if possible.”

Regarding the liquidation process for distribution of QCX funds to the exchange’s users, the report says that Ernst & Young has established a “Disbursement Account” per the Nova Scotia court’s orders, “and [it] received $150,000 from Ms. Jennifer Robertson” (Cotten’s widow) to kickstart the account.

The document continues to clarify that the exchange’s remaining hot-wallet funds (some $902,000 CAD, of which $700,000 CAD is in bitcoin, $130,000 CAD in ether and the rest in bitcoin fork coins and litecoin) will be transferred to cold storage under Ernst & Young’s management.

In an affidavit that comprises part of the ongoing legal proceedings in the Court of Nova Scotia, Robertson swore that the exchange had no access to the cold storage because the keys and passwords are stored in one of Cotten’s encrypted wallets.

According to the document, Ernst & Young has also seized Cotten’s computer hardware and accessories, which Robertson originally turned over to retired cybersecurity professional Chris McBryan of McKalian Sensors Inc. to crack.

“The devices taken into custody from Mr. McBryan include two (2) active laptops, two (2) older model laptops, two (2) active cell phones, two (2) older ‘dead’ cell phones and three (3) fully encrypted USB keys. … The Monitor’s forensic group is currently working with Mr. McBryan to better understand actions that have been taken in respect of the devices and what information has been obtained from the devices to date to determine what forensic next steps will be employed. In addition, the Monitor was made aware of and took steps to retrieve Mr. Cotten’s desktop,” the report reads.

Recovering Lost Funds
The document also confirms that Ernst & Young has contacted nine of the known payment processors that served as QuadrigaCX’s makeshift banking partners. The firm has not yet received the $30 million CAD in bank draft notes that both the court affidavit and the report say are under the auspices of Stewart McKelvey, the law firm representing both Robertson and QuadrigaCX. One of these processors allegedly owes the exchange $25.2 million of the $30 million in bank notes QuadrigaCX holds. Once the banks that these processors work with clear wires for these bank notes, the funds will fall under Ernst & Young’s management.

QuadrigaCX had been using these payment processors as a stand-in for proper banking relationships. As sources close to the matter, who asked to remain anonymous, told Bitcoin Magazine, QuadrigaCX has a long history of problems in maintaining banking relationships, a tribulation best represented by CIBC freezing $25 million CAD of funds associated with the exchange in 2018. This freeze was one of many unhappy incidents that have come to define the exchange, including losing millions in ether in 2017 to a smart contract bug and a reputation for month-long withdrawal times.

Speculation and Rumors
Since Gerald Cotten’s death, wild speculation over QuadrigaCX’s solvency, the identity of a since-distanced cofounder Michael Patryn and whether Cotten is actually dead have surfaced in the community. A purported QuadrigaCX contractor, one of the seven that made up the company’s employee structure until recently, posted a reddit AMA on r/QuadrigaCX2 with potentially damning accusations that Cotten and Robertson worked in tandem to scam the exchange’s users. These accusations remain unsubstantiated thus far.

Canadian lawyers will convene on February 14, 2019, in Halifax in a bid to represent some 111,000 users affected by the exchange’s misfortune, Bloomberg reports. In its February 5 ruling, the Court of Nova Scotia granted QuadrigaCX creditor protection, guarding it from further court action until the exchange and Ernst & Young are able to investigate its financial situation.",Law & Justice,-0.8807

2019/2/14,"QuadrigaCX Sent Deposits Allegedly Linked to CEO’s Widow, Mailed Withdrawals in Cash","For those QuadrigaCX users who were fortunate enough to have withdrawal requests honored, some appear to have received their funds through unconventional means.

An anonymous QuadrigaCX user who corresponded with Bitcoin Magazine said that they received a bank deposit from Robertson Nova Consulting Inc. (RNC) on their bank statements. Registered with the Canadian government as Robertson Nova Property Management Inc., the corporation's sole employee, Jennifer Robertson, who is the widow of the exchange's late CEO, Gerald Cotten, is listed as recognized agent, director and president/secretary, according to Nova Scotia public records. The company's office address is 71 Kinross Court, Nova Scotia, the same address as Jennifer Robertson and Gerald Cotten's former home, which recently sold for $1.1 million CAD.

Bitcoin Magazine reviewed a financial inquiry into the individual’s bank account deposit history to confirm that the amounts deposited on the bank statement matched the emails.

The reply-to line of the message includes what is believed to be Robertson's email address (jenniferkm.robertson@gmail.com), as well. Robertson, who was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, legally changed her name from Jennifer Kathleen Margaret Griffith to Jennifer Kathleen Margaret Robertson on December 1, 2016.

Screenshot of email to QuadrigaCX user

Other QuadrigaCX users have reported receiving bank deposits from Robertson Nova Consulting, as well, showing up as ROBERTSON NOVA on their bank statements as payroll deposits (these reports were vetted by a separate anonymous source close to the matter). As was the case with the individual who originally leaked the news to Bitcoin Magazine, these deposits took place in early March of 2017. Clients also noted another email address, jennifer.forgeron8@gmail.com, as a reply-to from RNC Inc. deposits, as well.

Whether or not the funds came from Robertson, the reply-to implicates her in the exchange’s business dealings, something she swore she was not involved with in her affidavit to the Nova Scotia court at the inception of legal proceedings.

“I was not involved in the business of the Companies while Gerry was alive,” item 53 of the affidavit reads. However, if a company operated by Robertson initiated the deposits, that could implicate her in QuadrigaCX’s businesses and contradict her statements.

If [these] anonymous statements are later substantiated and gain admission into evidence,"" Chetan Phull of Smartblock Law, told Bitcoin Magazine, ""it is possible that the widow’s evidence will be doubted or thrown out for lack of credibility. Many factors would be at play, including the widow's knowledge and intention.""

If users didn’t receive funds from RNC Inc., they may have received them in physical cash instead. The same source who leaked the information on Robertson’s potential involvement in the company also told Bitcoin Magazine that they had hard cash delivered to their home as a withdrawal option from QuadrigaCX.

Three separate withdrawals came with return addresses to Quadriga Vancouver, British Columbia, though the source said that Canada Post tracking sourced the packages to three separate mailing addresses: Richmond, British Columbia; Calgary, Alberta; and Sherwood Park, Alberta. Given Canada’s vast landscape, the source emphasized that these locations are hundreds of miles apart.

These accounts corroborate reports that QuadrigaCX honored, at one point, withdrawal requests with physical cash, something that QuadrigaCX openly advertised as an option on its website when it was still active, multiple sources confirmed to Bitcoin Magazine. Some of these sources received upwards of $10,000 dollars in cash.

The developments complicate the role hard cash has played for the company in its troubled history. As the exchange advertised, users were encouraged to deposit and withdraw in-person at the exchange’s outposts. One of these, the Globe and Mail reports, no longer operates as a cash repository for the company, and Aaron Matthews, a QuadrigaCX contractor, owns the property, which he rents out.

QuadrigaCX co-founder Michael Patryn told Bitcoin Magazine that in-person deposits/withdrawals are not uncommon for the cryptocurrency industry, citing an early exchange venture of his, Vault of Satoshi, as well as other Canadian exchanges Einstein and Coinsquare (which no longer does). Patryn admitted that sending hard cash through the mail “sounds less common” and said that neither practices were standard procedure before he parted ways with the company in March 2016.

Less than common, the practice is unheard of in the industry for an exchange of QuadrigaCX’s stature and repute, which has served over 100,000 users. Given QuadrigaCX’s inability to maintain banking relationships in the past (when it was still operating, the exchange relied on a miscellany of international payment processors to substitute as fiduciary partners), the availability of mass liquid capital calls into question how QuadrigaCX managed to acquire these funds and where they’ve been stored.

Mounting legal action for QuadrigaCX will top another milestone today as law firms from around Canada will meet in Halifax to win the right to represent affected Quadriga users in a class action lawsuit against the exchange.

2019/2/14,Judge Delays Decision to Appoint Legal Counsel for QuadrigaCX Creditors,"A group of lawyers from some of Canada’s top law firms convened in a court in Halifax, Nova Scotia, today to secure the right to represent creditors in the ongoing QuadrigaCX litigation. By the end of the hearing, the presiding judge wouldn’t make a decision on which firm would play counsel for QuadrigaCX’s clients, though he promised a decision within the week.

“The decision to delay appointment of representative counsel is a sound one. The Court needs to be able to select the right firm that can present Canadians across the country with expertise and in a cost-effective manner. Most users are in British Columbia and Ontario and so firms with solid representation there would be key, so that customers from those provinces have access to the process,” Christine Duhaime of Duhaime Law told Bitcoin Magazine.

During the session, the Honorable Justice Michael Wood heard testimonies from the four law firms that creditors have turned to for counsel, namely, Bennett Jones LLP; Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP; McInnes Cooper LLP and latecomer Goodmans LLP.

Jack Julian, a reporter for Canadian news outlet CBC, live-tweeted the courtroom proceedings, tallying up a total of 18 lawyers who were present at the hearing. One of these, Maurice Chiasson, represented QuadrigaCX while another represented Ernst & Young, the firm that has been appointed monitor over the case; the rest represented some 200 clients affected by the exchange’s inability to honor withdrawals. These clients reportedly have $50 million CAD tied up in the exchange in the aftermath of the death of its founder and CEO, Gerald Cotten. The $50 million CAD represented today is just a piece of the $250 million CAD debt that the exchange owes its customers.

“There are many complicating factors in this motion,” notes blockchain lawyer Chetan Phull of Smartblock Law. “The ‘creditors’ are spread out all over the world, QuadrigaCX is running low on funds for its defense, and Justice Wood has one week to decide who will represent all the creditors. This must be a difficult decision for Justice Wood. Relevant considerations will likely include competence with cryptocurrency and international resources. The first factor will be important to address solvency matters as they relate to the accessibility of various cryptocurrency reserves of QuadrigaCX. The second factor will be important to cost-effectively triage client-intake and evidence management for a litigation with such a global scope.”

“Justice Michael Wood says all contenders are ‘eminently qualified’ to be representative counsel. They all claim to represent similar numbers of clients with similar total losses. He says he ‘won’t be flipping a coin’ and will have to analyze the submissions closely,” Julian tweeted.

One of the firms, Goodmans, which Julian says has a client with a $1 million claim on the exchange, suggested creating a “steering committee” of seven individuals, which would consist of two lawyers from the other three law firms competing for representation and one from Goodmans. The committee would then be in charge of appointing legal counsel for the affected creditors. Justice Wood ultimately dismissed this proposal, saying it would amount to the firms having to “duke it out,” tweeted Julian.

According to Julian, Raj Sahni, an attorney for Bennett Jones, lambasted the use of online chat rooms as “completely inappropriate” for disseminating information in this case. In the fallout after Cotten’s death, Reddit (particularly the subreddit QuadrigaCX2) has become a hotbed of activity for QuadrigaCX customers to swap information, air grievances and cook up what most would consider conspiracy theories.

To cut through the noise and give this information legitimacy, one firm, Miller Thomson, suggested curating a website that would aggregate creditor information and answer questions these affected users have in public or private.

The proceedings highlighted that most of the creditors are individuals with fewer than $50,000 CAD in the exchange. These affected users are already down significant capital, and the legal counsels stressed the importance of making this process as frictionless as possible to mitigate legal costs for the already cash-strapped creditors. The monitor, Ernst & Young, has proposed a $100,000 CAD cap on fees beginning today, which would exclude fees calculated to this point.

Even as lawyers are seeking to expedite the counsel appointment process to the capital benefit of their representatives, it became apparent early on that Justice Wood might not reach a decision today. The case is murky and unconventional, he said, and Julian tweeted that the robustness of each law firm contending for legal counsel hasn’t made “life any easier” for the judge regarding his decision.

“Wood says this [is] an odd situation. We don’t have secured and unsecured creditors, third party suppliers, employees etc. Only clients. So it’s unlikely there will be parties clamouring for changes on the next court date of March 5,” Julian wrote.

After a midday recess, the court reconvened and Justice Wood revealed that he would not decide on representative counsel today, as choosing between the four will be difficult. While he said that each is ""eminently qualified,"" Chetan Phull of Smartblock Law said that the ideal counsel will have to have a stellar report card for handling the technological nuance and international breadth of the case.

""Relevant considerations will likely include competence with cryptocurrency and international resources. The first factor will be important to address solvency matters as they relate to the accessibility of various cryptocurrency reserves of QuadrigaCX. The second factor will be important to cost-effectively triage client-intake and evidence management for a litigation with such a global scope.”

Outstanding Issues
At the end of the hearing, the court also addressed a number of outstanding issues in the case, including the absence of $30 million CAD worth of bank draft notes that QuadrigaCX claims that it is owed by its payment processing partners. QuadrigaCX is making haste to secure these funds as most of the $300,000 CAD it has in its possession for legal fees are nearly depleted.

“The Court learned today that the advisors are almost out of the money allocated, having spent $250,000 in fees in a short time. It remains unclear how additional funds will be secured because there was only $300,000 set aside that was a secured debt to Mr. Cotten’s widow, approved by the three new directors, the Court heard. I think they will have to solve the cash crunch soon by securing banking relationships quickly to deposit the over $20M in bank drafts they said they have,” Duhaime commented to Bitcoin Magazine.

As monitor, Ernst & Young commented that it was close to reaching deals with some of these nine processors, though the firm was vague on the progress it has made toward decrypting Gerald Cotten’s hardware, which allegedly holds the keys to the company’s inaccessible cold storage, or in retrieving the $460,000 CAD that QuadrigaCX “inadvertently” sent to one of its cold wallets on February 6, 2019.

Bitcoin Magazine recently broke news that multiple QuadrigaCX users have reported receiving deposits from Robertson Nova Consulting Inc., a company, CBC claims, that Gerald Cotten’s widow, Jennifer Robertson, presides over as president, secretary and director. Bitcoin Magazine’s sources commented that email addresses appearing to belong to Robertson were listed on the reply-to lines of deposit confirmations. The same sources also told Bitcoin Magazine that they had received mass amounts of cash, at times amounting to thousands of dollars, in the mail as part of the withdrawal process.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.128
2019/2/15,"QuadrigaCX CEO Widow Sells Estate Assets, Reportedly Places Others in Trust","Jennifer Robertson, the widow of the late QuadrigaCX exchange CEO, appears to be liquidating and shuffling some estate assets.

When QuadrigaCX founder and CEO Gerald Cotten passed away suddenly in December of 2018 in India, he was allegedly the only person with the knowledge of the exchange’s cold storage keys. In his will, Cotten names Robertson executrix of his estate, as well as endowing her as its primary beneficiary. The exchange waited roughly a month from Cotten’s reported time of death to making his passing public, enough time for his widow to go through probate and transfer the estate’s assets to her name.

Cotten’s will itemizes a host of high-end assets that are now under Robertson’s control. The CEO left his wife his Jeanneau 51 sailboat; an airplane, a Lexus and a Mini Cooper (among other unnamed motor vehicles); and properties at 1021 Lamont Lane, Kelowna, British Columbia, 71 Kinross Court in Nova Scotia, 511 and 512 Ringling Court in Nova Scotia and 34 Little Island and Seaview Drive in Nova Scotia to his widow. He also left $100,000 for the continued care of his two chihuahuas, Gully and Nitro.

According to Canadian news outlet the Chronicle Herald, Robertson has taken out a second mortgage on each of these properties and placed at least two in a trust fund called the Seaglass Trust, a strategic legal move that lawyers told the outlet could add a layer of insulation between the assets and creditors in the ongoing QuadrigaCX litigation. Bitcoin Magazine could not independently validate that the trust exists.

The Chronicle Herald also reports that Robertson has sold the Kinross property for $1.1 million CAD. A source close to the matter, who asked to remain anonymous, told Bitcoin Magazine that they spoke with a real estate agent who claims to have represented Robertson in the house’s sale.

Cotten’s sailboat was also reportedly listed for sale for nearly $500,000 CAD, though the post has since been taken down (archived link here).

Another dozen properties in Halifax valued at roughly $6 million CAD are reportedly under the management of Robertson’s real estate company, Robertson Nova Property Management Inc., according to the Chronicle Herald. Robertson is listed as the company’s director, president/secretary and recognized agent, according to Nova Scotia public records, with the couple’s former Kinross residence listed as its office. In his will, Cotten dictated that his shares in the company are to be jointly shared between Robertson’s mother Carol Terry and her spouse Thomas Beazley.

As reported by Bitcoin Magazine, QuadrigaCX customers report receiving funds from Robertson Nova Property Management Inc. (showing up as RNC Inc., a.k.a., Robertson Nova Property Management Inc., on their bank statements). The deposit confirmation emails for these payments include reply-to lines with one of two emails believed to belong to Jennifer Robertson. If Robertson was involved with the company’s operations, that would contradict her sworn affidavit that she was not implicated in its dealings during Cotten’s life",Law & Justice,0.6124
2019/2/19,Judge Chooses Representative Counsel for QuadrigaCX Creditors,"Justice Wood has appointed legal counsel to represent some 115,000 creditors in incipient legal proceedings against seemingly insolvent cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX, documents published today, February 19, 2019, from the Halifax, Nova Scotia court reveal.

After postponing his decision, in a hearing on February 14, 2019, to choose one of four legal teams vying to represent affected users, Wood has given the bid to Miller Thompson and Cox & Palmer, a joint-counsel of two firms that collectively have logged “extensive insolvency experience.” Included with this experience, the firms have a useful understanding of the Canadian Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA), a law that applies to insolvency cases of $5 million CAD or more. Wood was also impressed with the complementary expertise the two firms represent and the synergy they employed to exploit their expertise efficiently on behalf of their clients.

“Miller Thompson has additional depth in certain areas, including larger CCAA proceedings and cryptocurrency ...The relationship between the two firms has been thought out carefully with a view to minimizing costs. Cox & Palmer will deal with their areas of expertise, including local litigation practice and court appearances. Miller Thompson will provide expertise in dealing with large creditor groups and cryptocurrency technology,” the judge wrote in the court statement.

“They propose a limited initial mandate and a cap on counsel fees in recognition of the reality that it is the users who will ultimately be paying,” he continued.

Dividing labors and setting a cap of $250,000 for legal fees to cut costs for an already cash-strapped creditor base is prudent, Justice Wood points out, as is the co-op’s plan to set up an online communication medium for creditors.

In the initial hearing to designate counsel, the judge made note of the role online “chatrooms” for the dissemination of information regarding the situation (he’s referring most ostensibly to Reddit, which has become a fertile ground for discussion and speculation since the fiasco started unravelling).

Miller Thompson/Cox & Palmer have proposed a “reasonable” alternative, the judge claimed, while agreeing that “some presence in social media and online discussion groups is necessary in order to reach the user group members.” This counsel-sponsored medium would hopefully add clarity and legitimacy to Reddit’s unverified accounts.

The judge’s decision comes as the Canadian Bitcoin community is vexed with questions over where their money went after QuadrigaCX CEO Gerald Cotten allegedly died in India last December with the only knowledge of the exchange’s cold wallet keys.

Many theories have cycled through social media, including conspiracies that Cotten faked his death, scuttlebutt of the type that has made the judge wary of Reddit’s use as an avenue for information.

Still, even disregarding these theories, more questions loom over the debacle than answers, including Jennifer Robertson’s (Cotten’s widow) involvement in the company and activity after the CEO’s death and the exchange’s sources of liquidity, which apparently favored sending cash in the mail or redeeming it to customers in person rather than through bank deposits.

As creditor suits mounted following QuadrigaCX’s inability to honor withdrawals, QuadrigaCX filed for creditor protection, which was approved by the court on February 5, 2019. Per CCAA procedures, the court moved to consolidate creditor legal representation, something Justice Wood explicated in today’s court document.

“There are two primary rationales given for the appointment of representatives and representative counsel in CCAA proceedings. The first is to provide effective communication with stakeholders and ensure that their interests are brought to the attention of the Court and other CCAA participants. The second is to bring increased efficiency and cost effectiveness to the proceeding as a whole. This latter objective can be attained by streamlining notification to stakeholders through their representatives and eliminating the need for multiple counsel to be retained by individual stakeholders to represent their interests.”",Law & Justice,0.9713
2019/2/25,QuadrigaCX and the Million Dollar Questions: What We Do and Don’t Know,"A court in Nova Scotia has approved a motion to move the case against QuadrigaCX into bankruptcy proceedings. These developments follow Ernst & Young's fourth monitor report, in which the firm recommended bankruptcy reclassification for the case and reported that CEO Gerald Cotten mixed QuadrigaCX business finances with his personal finances. Under bankruptcy proceedings, Ernst &Young will act as trustee and have far greater leeway to audit QuadrigaCX's finances and business practices, by reviewing documents from the exchange and by working directly with witnesses, for instance.

Update March 22, 2019: Affected QuadrigaCX Users Form Committee

So far, 119 affected QuadrigaCX users have applied to represent the approximately 115,000 customers left stranded when the beleaguered exchange shut down in February.

Of these, seven were selected by law firms Miller Thomson and Cox and Palmer to work with them and the Monitor to try and recover the missing $136 million, examine court documents and communicate with other affected users.

Appointed to the committee are Parham Pakjou, David Ballagh, Eric Bachour, Ryan Kneer, Magdalena Gronowska, Eric Stevens and Nicolas Deziel, with Richard Kagerer and Marian Drumea assigned as alternates.

One committee member, Eric Bachour, was also affected by the Mt. Gox meltdown, so he has experience with bankruptcy and crypto issues.

Committee members will be representing roughly 960 users who have applied as creditors and will receive compensation for out-of-pocket expenses.

Update March 19, 2019: Bloomberg Obtains Official Documents of Patryn’s Name Change

Bloomberg has obtained evidence from Canadian officials to prove that Michael Patryn is Omar Dhanani. The co-founder of QuadrigaCX, who allegedly distanced himself from the operation in 2016, changed his name twice, in 2003 and 2008. After being deported from the United States following an 18-month federal prison sentence for credit card related identity theft, Dhanani changed his name to Omar Patryn in 2003 and then to Michael Patryn in 2008, a certificate from the British Columbia Vital Statistics Agency reveals. While incognito, Dhanani/Patryn established an e-currency exchange, the Midas Gold Exchange, before going on to cofound QuadrigaCX. The community has long speculated that Dhanani and Patryn are one in the same but lacked hard evidence to substantiate this claim.

Update March 15, 2019: Legal Team Withdraws and Canadian Government Calls for Regulations — by Jessie Willms

Jennifer Robertson Releases a Statement and Looks for a New Legal Team

In a statement released by her lawyers on March 13, 2019, Jennifer Robertson, Gerald Cotten’s widow, revealed that, during his dispute with CIBC, her husband had mixed his personal finances with QuadrigaCX funds in order to process withdrawals:

“While I had no direct knowledge of how Gerry operated the business, he told me that he had been putting his own money back into QCX to fund user withdrawals in 2018 while the CIBC money remained frozen,” said Robertson.

The statement also noted that the legal team at Stewart McKelvey will no longer be representing Robertson due to an unspecified conflict of interest:

“I have been advised by Stewart McKelvey that, in light of concerns regarding a potential conflict of interest that have been raised as a result of information which has come to the attention of the Monitor since the start of the CCAA process, they have withdrawn from representing QuadrigaCX (QCX) and the other applicant companies in the CCAA process,” said the statement.

Calls for Regulation in Response to QuadrigaCX Fiasco

It’s no surprise that, in light of extensive QuadrigaCX media coverage, Canada’s mainstream media has been calling on its government to bring in better oversight and regulation of cryptocurrencies businesses, especially cryptocurrency exchanges.

In response to these calls for more regulation as well as requests from some crypto businesses for regulatory clarity, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) and the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) released a discussion paper on March 14, 2019, with a “New Proposed Platform Framework” that would aim to specifically tailor regulations to the risks posed by crypto exchanges.

CSA is a federal government agency coordinating financial regulations for Canadian capital markets and IIROC is the industry’s self-regulatory organization that oversees investment dealers in Canada’s debt and equity markets.

The paper requests comment from crypto/fintech companies, market participants/investors and other stakeholders to see what regulations would best fit the nascent cryptocurrency market. Among these regulations and requirements, the agencies want to understand how to approach custody, fund attestation, fee structures, fund insurance, managing conflicts of interest, clearing and settlement and market surveillance.

The proposed regulations would apply to Canadian-based platforms and those platforms with Canadian investors. Deadline for comments is May 15, 2019.

Update March 2, 2019: The Globe and Mail has retrieved a mugshot of Omar Dhanani. The picture, a much sought after piece of evidence in the pursuit of linking Dhanani to Patryn, seems to confirm Patryn’s identity as Dhanani (more info in the “Loose Ends and Conspiracy Theories” section of this article.

Update March 2, 2019: Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has launched a bounty campaign for the ongoing QuadrigaCX investigation. The exchange is offering a reward of $100k to anyone who can provide tips/evidence that will lead law enforcement to the missing funds. Submissions here.

Update March 5, 2019: In its third report as monitor, E&Y has indicated that QuadrigaCX’s cold wallets are empty. Five of six of these wallets have been empty since April 2018, while the six one was emptied about a week before Cotten’s death. The firm also found evidence of QuadrigaCX/Cotten operating 14 accounts on the exchange that “may have been created outside [its]norma processes.” These accounts, the firm explains, may have been credited with non-existent fiat deposits and were registered under several aliases. In the same report, E&Y also discovered that QuadrigaCX/Cotten held accounts at at least four other exchanges that had been previously identified by blockchain analysis from James Edwards and Taylor Monahan; QuadrigaCX may still have funds on these exchanges. Finally, the firm has transferred some $25 million CAD from QuadrigaCX’s payment processors into its own account with the Royal Bank of Canada.

Update: March 5, 2019: during today’s court hearing, Justice Wood has granted QuadrigaCX a 45 day stay on proceedings. He has also appointed Peter Wedlake, a Grant Thorton lawyer who is part of QuadrigaCX’s counsel, as the company’s Chief Restructuring Officer, though the judge was reluctant at first to approve the position for cost and efficiency concerns. The court will reconvene for the next round of proceedings on April 18, 2019, while the stay extends QuadrigaCX creditor protections until April 23, 2019. Source.

QuadrigaCX Exchange’s founder, Gerald Cotten, passed away more than two months ago, and with his death, the keys to the exchange’s cold storage allegedly went to the grave with him.

This is the story that QuadrigaCX is sticking to in the posthumous mess that has followed its founder’s death. The situation has been likened to a second Mt. Gox, with some of the biggest differences being that we don’t know whether or not QuadrigaCX is solvent and there’s no hard evidence of foul play on behalf of the exchange. But there are also more questions than answers, and lack of hard evidence or transparency in the situation (including, whether or not there are cold wallets and whether or not QuadrigaCX is being honest about not having access to them) is the exchange’s closest resemblance to Mt. Gox: no one’s completely sure of what happened and what’s going on.

This has led media, social media commentators and other community voices to see the facts of the case through different lenses. Some have argued that QuadrigaCX has no cold wallets, others have said they must be lying about not having access to these funds. One bold camp has even called the likelihood of Cotten’s death into question. This conspiracy is tenuous, as death certificates are public (even if Cotten’s name is misspelled as “Cottan” on the certificate, likely an honest mistake made by crossing the language barrier); Globe and Mail reporters even traveled to Jaipur and spoke with doctors who verified his death.

Those doctors, the accounts recall, also signaled that Cotten’s death was unconventional, as was how the body was handled — but more on that later.

QuadrigaCX would keep Cotten’s death from the public and its clients for about a month, enough time for his widow, Jennifer Robertson, to transfer the contents of her husband’s estate as set out in his will — a document updated two weeks prior to his death — into her name. All the while, customers complained about their perpetual struggle to withdraw cash and coins from the exchange. It has since ceased operations due to its self-proclaimed inability to access cold wallets to address these liquidity issues.

Plenty of affected users think the funds are gone and the wallets don’t exist, and evidence — some hard, some soft — is piling up to suggest that there’s something amiss with how things stand now.

After corresponding with multiple persons who either knew Cotten well, were QuadrigaCX customers or who were associated with the exchange’s business, Bitcoin Magazine learned that questions have surrounded QuadrigaCX's operations for some time — enough to warrant skepticism about the story it’s been presenting.

This account will give an overview of what we know so far. It attempts to be thorough but not exhaustive and to treat conspiracies with skepticism while not ignoring them.

Trouble Brewing
Gerald Cotten died unexpectedly on December 9, 2018, while vacationing in India. His sudden death has been framed as the culmination of Cotten’s seven-year battle with Crohn’s disease, though Cotten’s death at the age of 30 is rare for people with the disease. He passed away while under care at Fortis Escorts Hospital in Jaipur, India, where he was reportedly honeymooning with his newly wedded wife, Jennifer Robertson, when he had some extreme gastrointestinal pain.

Though Dr. Sharma originally diagnosed traveler’s diarrhea on Cotten’s first visit to the hospital, Cotten’s condition quickly deteriorated. Twenty-four hours later, after being readmitted, Cotten died of cardiac arrest induced by septic shock when his intestines were perforated, the death report notes.

The doctor told the Globe and Mail that Cotten’s death was “medically unusual,” particularly the way his condition dramatically worsened so rapidly. He and his staff are even a bit “[unsure] about the diagnosis.”

No autopsy was performed, and the apparent mysteries surrounding Cotten’s death become more complicated as he was prepped for burial. Dr Semmi Mehra, an embalming specialist at Mahatma Gandhi Medical College & Hospital, whom Robertson attempted to employ for Cotten’s embalming, refused because the body came from the hotel the couple were honeymooning at instead of from the hospital where Cotten passed.

“That guy told me the body will come from the hotel. I said: ‘Why the hotel? I’m not taking any body from the hotel, it should come from Fortis’,” Dr. Mehra told the Globe and Mail.

She would direct them to a public medical college in the area who would ultimately embalm the deceased crypto tycoon, the Globe and Mail reports.

Cotten’s death left the company’s leadership without a clear successor, as Cotten left no directions for appointing a new CEO, an oversight that complicates the exchange’s apparent inability to access cold wallet funds. An emergency shareholder meeting was called on January 25, 2019, to appoint new directors. The meeting resulted in Jennifer Robertson, her stepfather Thomas Beazley and Jack Martel being elected to the board. The meeting supposedly took place over a conference call, according to a conversation Bitcoin Magazine had with Michael Patryn, the exchange’s co-founder who claims to have distanced himself from the exchange since March 2016.

Two sources who knew Cotten told Bitcoin Magazine that they were shocked to hear that Cotten hadn’t put contingency plans in place for his sudden passing, saying that this was out of character for a man who always had security at the forefront of his mind.

“This is the part that gets a little bit hairy,” Michael Perklin, ShapeShift CISO, told Bitcoin Magazine. “For a business to operate for six years and not have a business continuity plan? That’s reckless. I was incredibly shocked to learn that they couldn’t access the wallet. Gerry was a very smart man. It was inconsistent with his personality to not have a backup if he was hit by a bus. We’re definitely missing important pieces of this,”

He added, “Gerry updated his will two weeks before his death. That proves that he is thinking about these things.”

QuadrigaCX waited more than a month to make Cotten’s death public, and they waited longer still to admit that the company was having trouble mustering up the liquidity to honor withdrawals.

By the time the exchange shut down, Jennifer Robertson had gone through probate to transfer the assets in Cotten’s estate to her name. During this in-between period, she listed (and allegedly sold) Cotten’s sailboat/yacht and placed four properties in a trust called the Seaglass Trust, reportedly taking out a second mortgage on two of these. One of these properties, Cotten and Robertson’s former home at 71 Kinross Court, Nova Scotia, has been sold, while another property in Kelowna, British Columbia, has also been sold, an anonymous source told Bitcoin Magazine.

Liquidity Issues
Before Cotten’s death, users embattled in months-long withdrawal issues aggravated the exchange’s reputation and troubled history. Even as early as March 2018, bad press plagued the exchange for a delayed withdrawal of over $100,000. This issue could be the consequence of the exchange’s tenuous relationship with its Canadian banking partners, a struggle that culminated in November 2018 as the Canadian Supreme Court ruled to take control of $21.6 million after the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) froze accounts related to QuadrigaCX's business. It also lost a not-insignificant sum of ether to a smart contract bug in June of 2017, worth $17 million CAD at the time.

QuadrigaCX's banking difficulties have been a recurring theme in the exchange’s five-year history, according to multiple Bitcoin Magazine sources, all of whom asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the ongoing case.

One long-time QuadrigaCX user filed a ticket on August 14, 2018, after attempting to withdraw cash in late July. QuadrigaCX support’s initial reply oddly claims, “Both have been processed and arrive in a few years [sic].” After the user continued to complain about not receiving their funds, a follow-up email stated, “There is no issue, just ongoing issues … with the banks,” — the exchange’s familiar mantra in response to withdrawal issues.

After going round-for-round over email with QuadrigaCX support for weeks, this customer received his funds nearly two months after he requested them and a month after he opened a support ticket.

This experience seems par for the course, as another user complained that withdrawal requests for himself and others have been marked as complete after a similar, month-long, back-and-forth exchange with QuadrigaCX, but the funds have still not been deposited into their accounts.

“They stopped replying to my emails after January 11,” this user told Bitcoin Magazine. He said that he’d initiated a withdrawal request on December 8, 2018, which was marked as completed on December 22, 2018, despite no funds hitting the user’s bank account. This particular individual has $2,000 tied up. We’ve spoken to an individual with a similar experience who is missing $1,100 and another who has lost more than $1 million CAD after failing to have withdrawals satisfied.

Michael Perklin said that QuadrigaCX has had banking troubles “[ever] since day one.”

“I know how very difficult it was to get a banking relationship,” he said in reference to the stubborn nature with which Canadian banks treat corporate accounts with cryptocurrency companies.

Continuing, Perklin said that ""any companies that dealt with cryptocurrencies in Canada, like QCX, faced huge problems opening and maintaining bank accounts. QCX rotated through multiple bank accounts for years to stay ahead of the account closures. While this may have seemed shady, it was the only way for QCX to continue serving customers.""

A Canadian business strategies and best-practice professional, who asked to remain anonymous, also attested to Bitcoin Magazine that QuadrigaCX’s relationships with banks were a stressed and constant “struggle.” They even introduced Cotten and QuadrigaCX to a potential banking partner, but, after the company failed to provide “beneficial ownership information,” the bank refused to do business with the exchange (QuadrigaCX’s failure to provide this information, the source said, may have to do with the connections between Michael Patryn and ex-con Omar Dhanani, something we’ll go over more in the “Loose Ends” section of this article).

These issues, the source believes, are a plausible reason behind QuadrigaCX’s multiple shell companies (QuadrigaCX Fintech Solutions Corporation and Whiteside Capital Corporation).

The death of the exchange’s CEO seems to have either exacerbated these banking problems or exposed them to the public more thoroughly. And while Perklin called QuadrigaCX ’s money transfer issues unsurprising, some aspects of the exchange’s withdrawal process were anything but — specifically, offering hard cash withdrawals in the mail or in-person as a preferable option.

Multiple clients have reported receiving thousands of dollars via Canada Post. Speaking to a few of these users, Bitcoin Magazine verified these reports: One of these individuals told us that, while the three packages they received listed QuadrigaCX, Vancouver, as the return address, Canada Post’s tracking information lists the packages’ origin as Richmond, British Columbia; Calgary, Alberta; and Sherwood Park, Alberta.

Besides using Canada Post, QuadrigaCX offered hard cash withdrawals via in-person pickups. This practice, while not totally unheard of in the cryptocurrency industry, is virtually non-existent for retail exchanges (Coinsquare, one of the only legitimate exchanges to have offered it, no longer does). More than just unconventional, the makeshift, lax nature with which the exchange went about processing these withdrawals is suspect.

One of Bitcoin Magazine’s sources recalled driving six and a half hours to the Laval pickup location in late January, after “getting the runaround” since November, wherein each attempt to transfer cash ended in its being processed and cancelled. This process went on for weeks; the client even attempted to transfer the money into ether to withdraw to another exchange but hit the same dead end. When the users tried to get answers, their queries were met by silence on social media, support tickets and calls to QuadrigaCX's offices.

“We had enough after Christmas and chose to pick up our cash at the location in Laval. They sent us an email confirming it was processed and would be available on Jan 21 at 10am,” the source explained. “We drove 6.5 hours to that location, only to find a nonexistent office suite with a mailbox drop there. No person. No one in the building knew of that company either. We called and left messages on that number provided and drove home. He finally called us a week later saying QuadrigaCX wasn't giving him the cash to hand out but if they did give him our cash (they were supposed to give him 5k) he would reserve our amount out of that and text us to come pick it up. Two days later he texted us and said they aren't giving him the money and he will be in touch.”

That was the last time they heard from QuadrigaCX’s cash lackey, who, judging by his responses, had little connection to the exchange besides being an intermediary for cash payments. Days later, the exchange would announce Gerry’s death and its likely insolvency.

As noted earlier, QuadrigaCX’s banking relationships were non-existent, and Robertson admits in her affidavit that the exchange “had no corporate bank accounts.” Cash would likely be hard to come by for an exchange with no corporate account with a licensed bank or fiduciary partner. Instead, the exchange had to rely on a patchwork banking system which consisted of nine or so payment processors, including the Canadian-based Bylls and Billerfy.

Billerfy CEO Jose Reyes was involved in the November 2018 proceedings that ended in the Canadian Supreme Court freezing $25 million CAD tied to the exchange’s business. According to court documents, he had three personal accounts frozen along with two corporate accounts for Costodian Inc., another payment processor QuadrigaCX used for its business, for which Reyes is the sole director and officer. Reyes had transferred some $1 or 2 million CAD to his personal account from Costodian’s corporate accounts, making it unclear to the court as to the ownership of the millions in deposits from 388 users.

“CIBC has not been able to determine to what extent the Depositors, Costodian, Reyes, QuadrigaCX and/or Billerfy Labs Inc. (“Billerfy”) are entitled to the Disputed Funds,” the court order states.

The $25 million is still stuck in limbo, along with $5 million more in CAD that the exchange holds in bank notes for funds held by other payment processors. Ernst & Young (EY), as monitor over the legal proceedings, has contacted the processors to collect this debt. In its second report, the monitor revealed that it had received $20 million in bank draft notes from Costodian, though it must wait for the approval of the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) to clear wires for the bank drafts to be deposited into a disbursement account that the monitor oversees.

In its second report, EY also indicated that Robertson and QuadrigaCX ’s litigation coffers are running low, insinuating that they are not far off from running out of funds entirely. If the RBC clears the bank draft wires into the disbursement account, this will keep the exchange’s legal operations afloat amidst the courtroom proceedings and restructuring.

Entering the Courtroom
After going offline on January 28, 2019, for reported maintenance, the exchange came out publicly to say that it did not have access to its cold storage, as Cotten had been the sole guardian of the wallet’s keys. In a sworn affidavit filing with the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Cotten’s widow Jennifer Robertson said that the funds are likely lost.

“QuadrigaCX's inventory of cryptocurrency has become unavailable and some of it may be lost.”

On February 5, 2019, the exchange filed for creditor protection with the Nova Scotia Supreme Court. EY was appointed as monitor over the case, giving the firm legal rights to oversee a compensation account for QuadrigaCX users as well as monitor the exchange’s current cryptocurrency balances and any hardware that may contain company information (namely, keys/seeds for the alleged cold storage).

In its first report as legal monitor, EY reported that it had begun funding the debtors’ compensation account with $150,000 CAD which Robertson supplied out of her own personal finance. More notably, the firm reported that QuadrigaCX “inadvertently” sent some $460,000 CAD worth of bitcoin to the cold wallets its employees reportedly can’t access. Perhaps in response to this blunder, the firm has taken control of QuadrigaCX's remaining hot wallet funds, as well as the funds that were accidentally transferred, and placed them in their own cold storage, the monitor’s second report reveals.

As with other exchange scandals in the industry, it didn’t take long for QuadrigaCX to rack up an adversarial list of investor-led reclamation suits. With funds for more than 100,000 users so far unaccounted for, Canada’s premier law firms lined up to represent the thousands who have come forth to challenge the company in court. These lawyers had a court date on February 14, 2019, to determine who would win the right to represent aggrieved clients in the legal proceedings looming ahead.

After delaying the decision a week due to the strength of the competing firms, presiding Nova Scotia Court Justice Wood ultimately gave the bid to Miller Thompson and Cox & Palmer for its apparent expertise with the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA), a piece of Canadian litigation that affects insolvency cases, and digital assets.

“Miller Thompson has additional depth in certain areas, including larger CCAA proceedings and cryptocurrency … The relationship between the two firms has been thought out carefully with a view to minimizing costs. Cox & Palmer will deal with their areas of expertise, including local litigation practice and court appearances. Miller Thompson will provide expertise in dealing with large creditor groups and cryptocurrency technology,” the judge wrote in a court order.

The case will re-enter the legal arena on February 22 for the next round of proceedings.

Where’d the Funds Go?
QuadrigaCX claims that the funds are inaccessible, but some creditors and blockchain professionals alike are starting to think the funds aren’t actually there.

For starters, QuadrigaCX has refused to attest to their cold storage reserves by making the public address for these wallets public. One Reddit user, dekoze, claims to have tracked funds from a hot wallet address listed in Robertson’s affidavit to five wallets that could constitute part of the exchange’s cold wallets. These wallets recently had 104.365 BTC sent and split between them, an amount nearly on par with the 103 BTC that QuadrigaCX “inadvertently” sent to its cold wallets on February 6, 2019.

Other blockchain transaction analysis suggests that QuadrigaCX has been cycling funds through competing exchanges, and they’ve also found little evidence that any cold wallet reserves exist.

James Edward (@ProofofResearch) first dropped this bombshell. Taking deposit addresses provided by QuadrigaCX customers, his transaction analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain found no trace of cold wallet reserves. Instead, it found a dizzying trail of transactions to and from popular exchanges like Kraken, Bitfinex and Poloniex, something he reinforced with later research using the wallets unearthed by dekoze (which Edward, in this newest research, actively disputes are cold wallets).

Taylor Monahan, the CEO of Ethereum wallet MyCrypto, corroborated Edward’s findings with her own analysis of the Ethereum blockchain. Like Edward, she found no convincing evidence that QuadrigaCX operated with cold wallet storage, and she also followed a tortuous trail of transactions that led to other exchanges like Bitfinex and, most notably, ShapeShift.

“It’s just bizarre,” she told Bitcoin Magazine.

“Totally hypothetical, it’s possible that QuadrigaCX has some hidden cold storage somewhere if, and only if, instead of going between a hot and cold wallet, they went directly from user deposit addresses to the cold wallet. Now, I went through their transactions for over three years, and it’s very hard for me to imagine that … with all the practices I’ve seen and how they operate and how often they move funds that they have a mechanism to put funds into the cold wallet that no one noticed.”

Hidden or not, she’s not convinced that the cold wallets are there, though, because she only found one instance of a cold wallet holding some 4,000 ether for more than a year, after which portions of these funds were sent to hot wallets for QuadrigaCX or competing exchanges. For the rest of the wallets that Monahan tracked, she believes that QuadrigaCX could have been market making to improve the appearance of exchange liquidity.

“This would mean having to source coins from an external source in order to fulfil withdraw requests because they’re playing with their own money,” she qualified. “Even if that’s the case, I cannot imagine why they would exchange ether through ShapeShift. This was something they did consistently over the years.”

Now, an exchange sending funds to another exchange isn’t anything new; exchange-to-exchange arbitrage and inter-trade is common in the industry. But QuadrigaCX ’s activity doesn’t make much sense, Monahan told Bitcoin Magazine, especially the millions in ether that was sent to ShapeShift, which charges higher fees than other exchanges for the convenience of instant cryptocurrency swaps.

The movement of funds could be customers depositing of their own volition, something that Monahan takes into account in her analysis. She says that those withdrawals are likely denoted by multi-numerical values, while funds QuadrigaCX was sending itself may be represented by rounded off numbers.

“When you look deeply into how an operation does something … everyone has their little quirks. For Quadriga, for example, they love to send exact amounts.”

The rationale for cycling funds through different exchanges amounts to a fractional reserve system, the same practice banks use today to shuffle credit. Basically, if QuadrigaCX did not have enough in their wallets to cover a massive withdrawal in bitcoin, they would send ether to something like ShapeShift to convert these funds to bitcoin to honor the withdrawal.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong believes this is the most likely scenario. In a Twitter thread, citing the exchange’s own internal transaction analysis, he speculates,“Patterns of sends from cold storage suggest they tried keeping [the] exchange afloat, and maybe attempted to trade their way out of a hole” — a hole that was in part dug by the exchange losing roughly 67,000 ether to a contract bug. That was in June 2017, after which time the exchange began draining their “cold wallets,” Armstrong holds.

Couple this with the 2018 bear market and you have a solvency crisis.

“This implies that at least a few people inside QuadrigaCX knew that they were running fractional. If so, then it's possible that untimely death of their CEO was used as an outlet to let the company sink,” he concludes.

In our conversation, Monahan noted decreasing transaction volumes following 2017, something that could either be attributed to Armstrong’s conclusion or to the anemic nature of the market in the bearish slump that began in 2018.

“You can definitely tell that the amount of money being moved around was very high in 2017 and has been dwindling, and previous to 2017, you see less activity. Whether that indicates something on QuadrigaCX's end is hard to say because every exchange is going through this [after the 2017 bull run].”

When asked about the strength of such transaction analyses, Perklin cautioned that “the only way to get a map of all of QCX movements would be to get all the deposit addresses.”

Loose Ends and Conspiracy Theories
For all that we do know about QuadrigaCX, there’s also plenty we don’t know — as well as lots of unsettling middle ground between the two.

Take, for instance, that a multitude of users who report receiving payroll deposits from RNC Inc., a company believed to be Robertson Nova Management Inc., a real estate management company registered in Robertson’s name. In the reply-to lines of emails confirming these deposits are listed one of two emails tied to Robertson. These deposits contradict Robertson’s sworn affidavit that she was not involved in the company’s business when Cotten was alive.

Questions also loom over the identity of Michael Patryn, QuadrigaCX ’s co-founder, who told Bitcoin Magazine that he cut ties with QuadrigaCX in March 2016. He left amidst a wider company exodus which gutted the shareholders sitting on the company’s board of directors. These directors, Patryn claimed, were upset with Cotten’s decision not to take the company public on the Canada Stock Exchange, a promise he made a year prior in 2015 which helped lead to the company raising $850,000 CAD in a private fundraising round. That same year, the exchange published its last financial audit, posting revenues of barely $80,000 CAD.

Patryn, who owns roughly 17 percent of the company’s shares, bought many of the shares off these individuals because “he wanted to make things right,” claiming that many of these shareholders were personal friends and invested because they “trusted” him.

Meanwhile, some skeptics don’t trust that Patryn is being honest about his identity. Critics and internet sleuths have argued that ""Michael Patryn"" is an alias for ""Omar Dhanani,"" an ex-con from California who was pegged for identity theft and fraud in 2004 after a sweeping bust of members involved in the cybercrime syndicate ShadowCrew. Omar Dhanani allegedly began using the alias Omar Patryn in 2005, according to a forfeiture case, and he was deported back to Canada in 2008.

The connections between Michael and Omar rest on the shared surname, as well as the presence of Dhanani’s relative, Nazmin Dhanani, on a company filing for MPD advertising that Michael Patryn made in 2009. Michael Patryn would start the Midas Gold Exchange, an online e-currency exchange that had ties with the Liberty Reserve in 2009, a private e-currency enterprise that was shuttered in 2013 by U.S. officials for money laundering and whose founder was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison. Midas Gold racked up a notorious reputation for fraudulent activity during its short lifespan.

In a February 28, 2019, Globe and Mail article, the Canadian newspaper makes the most definitive link between Patryn and Dhanani to date, providing a side-by-side-comparison of Dhanani with a photo obtained from the Passaic County Sheriff's Department in New Jersey and a YouTube screenshot of Patyrn from a 2015 video. The pictures appear to present the same person though Globe and Mail has not reviewed the photos with a forensics or facial recognition expert.

The conspiratorial web connecting Omar/Michael is documented elsewhere, so we won’t indulge it any further here. If the connections hold true, though, it paints a poor picture for the moral constitution of at least one of the company's founding members.

And it could explain the suspicious structure of the company’s operations. Amber Scott, the founder of Canadian Outlier Solutions, an anti-money laundering consulting firm, told Bitcoin Magazine, “QuadrigaCX was always ‘outside of my risk tolerance.’ Like many others in the community, I'm left wondering what I could have done differently to warn people when I saw red flags.”

A look into the company’s structure would be enough to give one pause. In her affidavit, Robertson revealed that, after 2016, “most of the business … was being conducted by Gerry wherever he and his computer were located.” The rest of the company’s employment base consisted of seven contractors, one of which, Alex Hanin, acted as the exchange’s sole developer, while the rest were a mixture of customer service representatives, social media managers and client verification employees.

One of these alleged employees hosted an AMA on the QuadrigaCX subreddit, which has since been deleted after the contractor reported that he was facing legal action from Jennifer Robertson’s legal council. Among other unverified claims, he alleged that QuadrigaCX was fraudulent from the start and that Jennifer and Gerry’s involvement from 2016 onward should be the chief area of concern for investigators, insinuating that Patryn and Lovie Horner, Patryn’s supposed partner, are no more than red herrings.

To attest to the veracity of his insider status, the contractor posted screenshots of the company’s Rocket Chat, as well as a photo of the funeral pamphlets used for Cotten’s funeral. Community members immediately raised questions as to why JA Snow Funeral Home, who hosted the burial, was misspelled as JS Snow on the pamphlet (though this could feasibly be a typo given the placement of “a” and “s” on a QWERTY keyboard).

A source with a computer science background shared a metadata analysis of the image provided with Bitcoin Magazine, pinpointing the photo to a Halifax airport IP on the day following the funeral.

The source clarified that ""the location was purely a long/lat that the iPhone's software embeds into the photo. The guy could've been using a VPN from [anywhere] and it would still say the pic was taken in the Halifax airport. He could take the photo with no internet connection and it would be tagged by the phone's GPS.""

This IP tracking and the contractor’s testament is not conclusively hard evidence of foul play, but the threat of legal action and the deletion of the AMA and the contractor’s Reddit account adds to the pile of questions surrounding the case.

2019/3/15,Karpeles Beats Embezzlement Charges in Mt Gox Ruling,"The Tokyo District Court has found Mark Karpeles, the former head of now-defunct Bitcoin exchange platform Mt. Gox, guilty of record tampering but innocent on other charges related to embezzlement and breach of trust.

Per reports in the Wall Street Journal, the court's verdict is a massive blow to Japanese prosecutors who have maintained their stance that Karpeles was guilty of embezzlement and breach of trust at Mt. Gox.

The sentence, which was carried out on March 15, will see him serve a suspended sentence of two-and-half years in prison. He can skip jail altogether if he stays on his best behavior.

While prosecutors pushed for a 10-year prison sentence, the court rebuffed some aspects of their claims and handed down a more lenient sentence.

How Things Went Sideways for Karpeles
Karpeles was the head of Mt. Gox when the firm applied for bankruptcy protection in 2014, following a security breach, where 850,000 Bitcoin (BTC), worth about 48 billion Yen ($430 million) at the time, was stolen from the exchange’s vaults.

He was subsequently arrested in 2015, following an accusation that he embezzled 341 million Yen (about $3 million) from the accounts of customers.

Per the allegations, he was alleged to have transferred the money from the accounts of the company’s customers directly into his own, using the funds to bankroll a lavish lifestyle.

The transfers were made with the use of his personal computer, then he went a step further, covering his tracks by falsifying the company’s records.

Mt. Gox’s Poor Accounting System Might Have Saved Him
The falsification of records was a major bone of contention for the court. In its ruling, the court pointed out that by falisfying records, Karpeles acted beyond the limits of his authority and against the general interests of the company.

Prosecutors took issue with Karpeles' decision to use a section of the supposedly embezzled funds to purchase a business that deals in 3D printers. However, the court pointed out that the acquisition could be viewed as a potential asset for the company and thus, it was seen as reasonable.

The court also pointed out that Mt. Gox lacked an efficient accounting system for when company executives borrowed money from the company, claiming that this made it impossible to determine whether the supposed funds Karpeles was said to have embezzled were from the company’s clients.

In his remarks, Presiding Judge Tomoyuki Nakayama stated that a data manipulation of this magnitude eroded the credibility of crypto exchanges. Pointing out Karpeles’ position and IT expertise, the judge asserted that there is no justification for such an abuse of information.

Karpeles Isn’t Going to Jail, But There’s Still Trouble Brewing for Him
While Karpeles seems to have scored a win here, things could still go sour for him.

Earlier this week, a court in Illinois ruled against his attempt to dismiss a class action lawsuit against him and the exchange.

The suit, which was brought up by some victims of the exchange’s hack, was upheld by Judge Gary Feinerman because it was filed within the appropriate jurisdiction; even though the exchange was based in Japan.

The plaintiffs accused Karpeles of painting an untrue picture of the exchange’s stability and security, as well as demonstrating negligence that led to their funds being stolen.

If found guilty, Karpeles could be compelled to make compensation and damages payments.",Law & Justice,-0.9383
2019/4/2,"In Fourth Report, QuadrigaCX Court Monitor Recommends Bankruptcy Proceedings","Electrum servers are still under a sustained Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack. The wallet developers announced the issue on April 7, 2018.

In correspondence with Bitcoin Magazine, Electrum developer Thomas Voegtlin speculated that the attack may be a form of retaliation from a phishing attacker who has been targeting Electrum in recent weeks. Since his phishing attacks had been thwarted, the attacker could now be resorting to DoS attacks instead, simply to frustrate Electrum developers and users. Voegtlin pointed out that, if this is the case, the behavior “is not rational” given the incumbent waste of the attacker’s resources.

A DoS attack is a fairly straightforward means of disrupting server activity, usually carried out by flooding a server with frivolous requests from a variety of different sources to overwhelm its processing capacity. Attacks of this nature can be carried out by an individual or by a number of actors, as the key method of attack is simply to overwhelm the server itself.

When a DoS attack targets a light wallet such as Electrum, it exploits the fact that users do not need to run their own nodes or connect directly to the Bitcoin network and, instead, connect to Electrum servers. By overwhelming these servers with DoS attacks, the wallets become less usable, as it takes a while to find a working server.

It’s also possible that the DoS is being carried out by the same person (or group) that was behind the phishing attacks in hopes that the DoS attack will increase the chance that the phishing attack can still succeed this way. As part of the phishing scam, users would connect to fraudulent servers. These fraudulent servers would then send users a phony message asking them to update to a new version of Electrum, sending a link to download coin-stealing malware. Voegtlin speculated that, by adding a DoS attack, the attacker may be hoping to overwhelm the legitimate servers of Electrum, making it more likely that users will inadvertently connect to the malicious servers.

Voegtlin suggested that the phishing attack is very unlikely to succeed, however: First, because the phishing attack only works on non-updated Electrum clients, and second, it only works if these clients connect only to malicious servers. Since clients always connect to 10 servers, that is very unlikely, he said. If even one of these servers is non-fraudulent, the phishing attempt will fail.

According to Voegtlin, while there is no ETA for the total fix for the DoS attacks, they are already being countered.

""We spawned more servers and we found how to blacklist botnet IP addresses,” he said. “That means some servers are usable now."" Electrum also plans to ban data-heavy clients as a way of curtailing the processing overload.

Updated versions of Electrum are not at risk of the phishing malware, but they can be affected by the DoS attack.

For now, Electrum suggests that users ""disable auto-connect and select their server manually."" Simply waiting a short while often does the trick as well.

“Give it time; sometimes it connects after a few minutes,” Voegtlin added. He also advises users to stay on a server that works for them and not switch.",Law & Justice,-0.9911
2019/4/10,QuadrigaCX Starts Bankruptcy Proceedings,"It’s been a long and winding road with many twists and turns for the beleaguered cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX and its 115,000 former users who are owed roughly $190 million.

On April 8, 2019, the case reached a critical fork in the road as a court, recognizing that attempts to restructure the exchange have failed, appointed business services firm Ernst & Young as the exchange’s Trustee in Bankruptcy to watch over bankruptcy proceedings. It will also assume control of all of QuadrigaCX’s assets.

Ernst & Young Takes Control
With QuadrigaCX moving into bankruptcy, it appears that Ernst & Young now becomes the dominant player in this ongoing drama as previously appointed Chief Restructuring Officer Grant Thornton will no longer be involved.

“EY will continue its investigation, but once it is the trustee, it will have greater powers to do so,” attorney Evan Thomas of Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt told Bitcoin Magazine. “This includes the power to examine people who have relevant information under oath.”

Critically, Ernst & Young will also have the ability to seize the exchange’s assets.

“The trustee can also sell QuadrigaCX's assets and start lawsuits to recover property or damages,” Thomas said. “The trustee will collect whatever it can recover for eventual distribution to creditors.”

The next step is a meeting of creditors who will elect a Board of Inspectors to oversee the work of Ernst & Young and grant permission to take actions such as selling its remaining assets.

It is likely, noted Thomas, that some of the same users elected to the Users Committee — a group of seven former QuadrigaCX customers who have been representing the 115,000 left stranded by the exchange — will be elected as these inspectors.

Jennifer Robertson’s Assets Are Frozen
Ernst & Young asked the court for and was granted an “asset preservation” order, meaning that all assets held by Jennifer Robertson, the wife of late CEO Gerald Cotten, and the Cotten estate are frozen.

The preservation order prohibits Robertson from selling, removing or transferring any assets. However, it allows her to cover her legal and living expenses by granting her access to two bank accounts overseen by Ernst & Young.

A source close to the case said it appeared that Robertson continues to retain the law firm Stewart McKelvey to represent her and the Cotten estate, despite earlier reports that said the firm was withdrawing its counsel.

What’s Next?
“There will be a claims process for creditors to file claims for consideration by the trustee,” said Thomas. “Eventually, whatever money or other property that is recovered by the trustee will be distributed to creditors with valid claims.”

The Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Case (CCAA) will continue temporarily while QuadrigaCX transitions to bankruptcy. Ernst & Young has said that it will be filing at least one more monitor's report. The CCAA will eventually terminate and court proceedings will continue under Canadian bankruptcy law.

2019/4/11,"Wikileaks Founder Julian Assange Arrested in London, Site’s Bitcoin Donations Spike","Julian Assange, co-founder of Wikileaks and early Bitcoin supporter, was arrested at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and faces extradition to the U.S. on conspiracy charges.

Having spent the last seven years seeking asylum in the embassy, Assange has at last lost the support of the Ecuadorian government. He was arrested on April 11, 2019, for failing to appear in British courts. Originally in hiding due to a Swedish arrest warrant over allegations of sexual assault completely unrelated to his involvement with Wikileaks, these charges have since been dropped altogether. Nevertheless, the British government has sought his arrest for failing to appear in court for these charges.

The elephant in the room for this prosecution is the involvement of the U.S. federal government. Pursuing him with only a single charge of conspiracy to commit computer hacking, law enforcement has made apprehending him a consistent priority as part of a campaign against Wikileaks’ whistleblowers on the War on Terror.

Wikileaks and Bitcoin
Assange has been a longtime supporter of the Bitcoin community for its ability to circumvent international crackdowns of this nature. After PayPal joined U.S. and Swiss-based banks in banning users from sending donations to Wikileaks, Assange began accepting bitcoin donations as the primary mode of funding in 2011. Wikileaks became one of the first major institutions to accept the payment method, bringing international press coverage to the fledgling crypto community.

Since then, Wikileaks has gone on to accept a gigantic amount of bitcoin over the years. In 2016, the site’s public donation address reached the milestone of a whopping 4,000 bitcoins, a sum worth millions of dollars. Even as Coinbase cut off support to Wikileaks’ online shop in 2018, the site continues to process sales and receive donations in bitcoin.

With the dogged persistence the U.S. government has shown in chasing Assange and other whistleblowers, his future upon extradition seems bleak. Chelsea Manning, the veteran who provided Assange with leaked evidence of U.S. war crimes, had her sentence commuted by U.S. President Obama. Nevertheless, she has been sent back to prison and was even condemned to solitary confinement for a month after refusing to testify against Assange in 2019.

Fellow whistleblower Edward Snowden, who has been in hiding in Russia for several years, called Assange’s arrest “a dark moment for press freedom.”

Assange’s arrest has already seen pushback from the crypto community, with the Wikileaks public address again seeing a large spike in bitcoin donations from a variety of sources. Still, his upcoming trial in the U.S. is all but certain.",Law & Justice,-0.9691
2019/4/11,"Craig Wright Threatens Libel Suit In Letter to Bitcoiner, Demands Apology","Update April 12, 2019: A crowdfund has been launched to help cover Hodlonaut’s legal fees. If you would like to donate, you can find the website here. Less than 24 hours after its launch, the fundraiser has raised $15,500, more than 75 percent of its soft cap goal. You can also donate by purchasing Hodlonaut swag through the BITCOINTEL.PRO store.

As community members band together to give Hodlonaut a monetary hand, another prominent member of the community, What Bitcoin Did podcaster Peter McCormack, has been served a similar letter to Hodlonaut’s own. McCormack directly challenged Calvin Ayre and Craig Wright on Twitter earlier this week, coaxing the duo by calling Wright a “fraud” and posting his business address and requesting legal action.

Craig S. Wright has officially taken the first steps in a legal action against a member of the Bitcoin community, according to a letter shared with Bitcoin Magazine.

The self-described Satoshi Nakamoto and Bitcoin SV creator has threatened to sue Hodlonaut, the creator of the Lightning Torch, for a series of tweets labeling him a “fraud” on Twitter. Following the forksplit of Bitcoin SV from Bitcoin Cash — and Wright’s continued indefatigable insistence that he is Satoshi — the community has been unyielding in its own insistence that Wright isn’t Satoshi. Tweets calling Craig S. Wright a “fraud” have become something of a meme in the community, inspiring hashtags like #CSWFraud and even going so far as to earn him the moniker “Faketoshi” among his opponents.

Wright has long threatened legal action against anyone who has labeled him a fraud on Twitter, and a letter that Hodlonaut received from Wright’s lawyers finally substantiates what was, for a time, just a looming threat.

The Letter and Demands
In a series of legal letters shared with Bitcoin Magazine, SCA ONTIER LLP., writing on behalf of Wright, demands that Hodlonaut retract his statements and apologize, or else their client will sue him for libel.

“We strongly suggest that you take legal advice upon the contents of this letter, which is written in compliance with the Pre-Action Protocol for Defamation applicable to the High Court of England and Wales,” the letter begins.

The firm, which states that Wright “is the person behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto,” continues to solicit Hodlonaut for his full name, email address and postal address (the letter was transmitted via Twitter). If Hodlonaut does not comply, “[Wright] will take steps to ascertain them by other means, including, if necessary, the making of applications to court to compel disclosure of this information by you and/or third parties.”

For the remainder of the letter’s first and second pages, the firm documents the tweets in question, which label Wright a “scammer” and call for “Craig Wright is a fraud Week” with the hashtag #CraigWrightIsAFraud.

“By tagging to [this] hashtag,” the letter charges, “you encourage your follows to view and contribute to that thread, which … is no more than a crude means by which our client can be abused and libelled.”

Saying that Hodlonaut’s “campaign against [Wright] has been sustained and systematic,” the firm then falsely states that this is because Hodlonaut is a promoter of Bitcoin Cash, an ostensible rival to the recently forked Bitcoin SV. Anyone who follows Hodlonaut on Twitter knows that this is a bizarre claim, as the user is an ardent Bitcoiner who has even aired grievances against Roger Ver for attacking the integrity of Bitcoin with the Bitcoin Cash fork.

The letter asserts that, taken in bulk, Hodlonaut’s claims that Wright isn’t Satoshi “has caused serious harm” to Wright. “The defamatory allegation,” it continues, has spread to Hodlonaut’s 8,000 plus followers — a “substantial portion” of which reside in its U.K. jurisdiction, the firm assumes.

The letter concludes with a series of demands. First, that Hodlonaut delete all of the tweets referenced in the letter (he’s done this under recommendation of his legal counsel, along with deleting his Twitter entirely); second, that he not repeat these allegations; and third, that Hodlonaut tweet an apology and appear in open court to apologize to Wright in person, acknowledging the “falsity of the allegations.”

Incredibly, the letter includes a prescribed apology that reads as follows:

“I was wrong to allege Craig Wright fraudulently claimed to be Satoshi. I accept he is Satoshi. I am sorry Dr. Wright. I will not repeat this libel.”
The Fallout
Wright threatens to sue Hodlonaut on the grounds of defamation and libel if he doesn’t comply with the demands within seven days of receiving the letter. This, as the letter admits, “is shorter than the period usually provided for by Pre-Action Protocol because the allegations are serious and ongoing” (even though Hodlonaut hasn’t tweeted about Wright since).

This directive expired on April 5. The letter says that, if the demands are not met, then Wright will file for proceedings in U.K. court and Hodlonaut will be served in his home country of Norway. Hodlonaut’s address is not public, however, and while the letter threatens that it will “locate [him]” to serve the litigation, this will likely prove difficult. A source close to the matter, who asked to remain anonymous, has indicated that no further action has yet been taken.

CoinGeek, the tabloid-esque cryptocurrency blog owned by Wright’s associate, Calvin Ayre, recently blew the escalating legal action into the open. The article reiterates much of what the legal letter said. But it also offers up a doxing bounty of $5,000 in BSV (enough for a whole bitcoin) to anyone who can identify Hodlonaut by tattoos displayed in the few photos he’s posted online.

It also targets other “social media sock-puppets” who have followed suit with Hodlonaut’s accusations, threatening that “these internet tough guys will have their own day in court soon enough.” Remarks like this run rampant in the article, which continues to assert that “Hodlonaut and the other trolls are about to discover why ‘he who laughs last, laughs best.’”

“They’re in for an even greater shock when they realize that the bastardized Bitcoin variants they’ve championed can’t scale to meet the needs of a truly global financial platform, and thus they’ve expended all this vitriol for nothing.”

Ayre, who has come under intense scrutiny recently for a rendezvous with allegedly underage Cuban dancers, has migrated some of the article’s threats to Twitter and has insinuated that more letters will be served to others Twitter users soon.

2019/4/17,Winklevoss Twins Reach Settlement With Charlie Shrem,"The Winklevoss twins reached a settlement with Charlie Shrem on April 16, 2019, declaring that their case against him has been dismissed with prejudice and will not be reopened.

The twins, who founded the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange, originally sued Shrem, the founder of early bitcoin company BitInstant, in November 2018, alleging that Shrem stole 5,000 bitcoin from the pair in 2012. They asserted that Shrem agreed to build a stockpile of cryptocurrency for them at their expense but then came up short by nearly $60,000 in bitcoin at the contemporary market rate, keeping this portion of the hoard secret until its worth grew to the tens of millions of dollars.

As the case proceeded, however, Shrem took an early upper hand. Several days after it was opened, federal judge Jed S. Rakoff ordered the end to a freeze on Shrem’s assets and financial accounts. Shrem’s legal team suggested that a separate person entirely was responsible for the unaccounted crypto assets.

After several months of relative quiet, the digitally-published proceedings of the case were updated in April 2019, suggesting a near end to the legal battle. On April 5, both parties declared to the court that they had reached an undisclosed settlement. This statement claimed that the suit was dismissed with prejudice but that both parties would have the opportunity to reopen the lawsuit within 30 days provided the agreement was not put into effect.

Neither party was inclined to let this deadline run out, however. A second statement released 11 days later, claimed “by and through their respective counsel of record, that the entire civil action be dismissed with prejudice.” Both parties will bear their own legal costs, and “the case will not be reopened.”

Given the brevity of these statements and the figures involved, further details regarding the exact agreement between the two parties may never become public knowledge.",Law & Justice,0.0258
2019/4/18,Mueller Report: Russia Used Bitcoin to Fund DNC Hacks,"An intelligence branch of the Russian government used bitcoin to fund its cyberwarfare efforts to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the Mueller Report claims.

The culmination of a two-year investigation, the “Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election” details the findings that Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his team uncovered during their inquiry into whether or not the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to hamper Hillary Clinton’s 2016 run for the presidency. United States Attorney General William Barr claimed in late March that the investigation found no evidence of such collusion, and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) released a redacted version of the full report on April 18, 2019.

Within the mammoth write-up, a small section details bitcoin’s role in bankrolling the Russian government’s cyberwarfare endeavors.

“... cyber intrusions (hacking) and releases of hacked materials [were] damaging to the Clinton Campaign,” the report reads on its fourth page. “The Russian intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations.”

Two military units of the GRU, the report continues some 30 pages later, hacked into computer hardware belonging to Clinton’s campaign, the Democartic National Committee (DNC) and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), leading to email leaks that revealed the DNC gave Clinton preferential treatment during the 2016 Democratic primaries.

A subunit of one of these two subdivisions ran “a bitcoin mining operation to secure bitcoins used to purchase computer infrastructure used in hacking operations,” the report states. Others ran “spearphishing campaigns” or developed specified malware to gain access to DNC hardware and data.

According to the report, this IT unit stored these bitcoin on the U.K.-based CEX.io, a cryptocurrency cloud mining service and exchange. They also used a portion of the mined bitcoin to anonymously purchase the domain name “dcleaks.com” on April 19, 2016.

Some of these findings were previously noted in a 2018 indictment from the DOJ. But with its report, the Mueller investigation corroborated suspicions that autocratic regimes like North Korea and Russia are using bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to bypass U.S. and international sanctions. This shadow economy, in effect, allows these regimes to fund illicit activities without immediately alerting international governments, precisely the role bitcoin filled for Russia during its interference in the 2016 election. While Russia extracted its reserves from mining, North Korea has orchestrated numerous South Korean crypto exchange hacks to fill its own coffers.

When asked at the Economic Club of Washington in January 2018 whether or not such activity is a cause for concern, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin affirmed, “I don’t think that’s a concern,” adding that cryptocurrency exchanges are held to the same KYC regulations as banks.

While CEX.io employs a strict KYC/AML policy, this didn’t impede Russian government agents from maintaining an account. But Mueller’s team eventually discovered Russia’s activity, even if it evaded CEX.io and the regulations that are meant to keep tabs on such exchanges.",Law & Justice,0.9313
