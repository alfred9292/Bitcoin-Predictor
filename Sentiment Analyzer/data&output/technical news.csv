2015/10/14,Debunking the 11 Most Stubborn Lightning Network Myths,"Earlier this year, Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja released the Lightning Network white paper. In it they theorize how a layer on top of the Bitcoin blockchain can allow for instant and cheap bitcoin transactions, while vastly improving its scalability.

As a result of the block-size limit debate, the Lightning Network has been getting a lot of attention lately. But, unfortunately, wild myths have started to dominate the discourse. Suddenly thrown in the middle of a long-lasting conflict of visions, Poon and Dryja's concept is hailed both as the great savior solving all of Bitcoin's problems – and as a source of deep corruption within Bitcoin's development community.

This article will not seek to explain how the Lightning Network is set to function on a technical level. Such explanations can be found here and here , and for those who really want to immerse themselves with all of the nitty-gritty details of how it all works, here .

Rather, this article addresses 11 common myths surrounding the Lightning Network, in hopes of putting these to bed for good.

Myth #1: Core developers are crippling Bitcoin to force users onto the Lightning Network.

Although Poon and Dryja, along with several others, are currently realizing their own Lightning Network-based startup, Blockstream has been the only company funding the development of the Lightning Network so far. Specifically, the Bitcoin business with a $21 million seed round under its belt empoyed Paul “Rusty” Russel to work on an implementation of the concept.

Meanwhile, some of Bitcoin’s most prominent developers -- such as Gregory Maxwell and Pieter Wuille -- are on Blockstream’s payroll, too. This has led some to believe that Blockstream is working nefariously. It’s been alleged that the company is blocking any increase of Bitcoin’s block-size limit, as this will drive up transaction fees, forcing bitcoiners to use the Lightning Network instead.

This logic, however, seems very farfetched at best.

First, it's not just Blockstream employees who prefer to keep blocks small. The “ decentralist ” side of the debate includes a diverse group of programmers and other bitcoiners, including Bitcoin Core lead developer Wladimir van der Laan , Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd , digital currency veteran Nick Szabo , former Bitcoin Foundation director Jon Matonis , bitcointalk.org and r/bitcoin admin “ theymos ,” and plenty of others.

Second, some of the most prominent Blockstream employees and Core developers opposing a block-size increase – most notably Maxwell and Wuille – were skeptical of raising this limit long before Blockstream was even founded, and long before the Lightning Network white paper was published. Both were, in fact, some of the first block-size conservatives, back when the controversy first arose early in 2013.

Third, even if transaction fees on the Bitcoin network do rise, that doesn't really “force” people onto the Lightning Network at all. It will always be possible to use the Bitcoin blockchain directly if one so wishes – it will just cost more. If anything, users might be incentivized to use the Lightning Network, which is categorically different from being forced to do so. And even that is debatable, as there are plenty of alternative solutions with which to transfer money.

But fourth, and most importantly, the case for smaller blocks is simply much more reasonable than the “force-bitcoiners-to-use-Lightning” argument would have you believe. The question of how to scale Bitcoin has been an issue since the early days, and almost all developers agree that oversized blocks pose a security risk. While it is debatable what block size is too big (and the decentralists might be off the mark on this one) it is hard to deny that the Lightning Network can solve real, existing problems in regard of scalability – not to mention cost and speed.

Myth #2: There is no conflict of interest for the Core developers employed by Blockstream.

On the other end of the spectrum, some developers employed by Blockstream and working on Bitcoin Core have claimed that their involvement in both projects are wholly separate and does not represent any sort of a conflict of interest.

This, however, is not true either, and claiming otherwise might be the result of a confusion of terminology.

According to Wikipedia:

“A conflict of interest (COI) is a situation in which a person or organization is involved in multiple interests, financial interest, or otherwise, one of which could possibly corrupt the motivation of the individual or organization.”

(Other sources cite similar definitions.)

In this context, the word “possibly” is key. The Core developers working for Blockstream do not actually need to be influenced by the company when they work on Bitcoin for there to be a conflict of interest. The simple fact that they potentially could be, is reason enough. Even if Maxwell, Wuille and others are all perfectly capable of separating their two occupations, and they work as honestly and properly as humanly possible for both Blockstream as well as Bitcoin Core, their involvement in both is still a conflict of interest.

It should be noted, however, that absent an independent and sustainable funding model for Bitcoin developers, there might always be conflicts of interest within the development community. Whether that poses a problem, and how big that problem is, is up for debate. But no one has presented a clear-cut and workable solution for this problem yet.

Myth #3: The Lightning Network will be controlled by Blockstream

It is sometimes suggested that Blockstream will effectively control the Lightning Network, and, as such, will be able to determine how people use it, and what for.

There is some truth to this argument. If Blockstream deploys a fully functioning Lightning Network, they will technically control the code base.

However, the Lightning Network is an open-source project. And, as opposed to Bitcoin itself, it's not even an open-source project that requires consensus among all Bitcoin users over the protocol rules. This means that anyone can fork the Lightning Network any time they want, potentially adjust the code in any way they want, and deploy their own version whenever they want. It might even be possible for users of different types of Lightning Networks to transact with each other, as long as there are nodes connecting the two.

Indeed, competing implementations of the Lightning Network, such as Amiko Pay , are being worked on already, while Poon, Dryja and others are setting up a company to realize their own implementation. Moreover, two Lightning Network-type solutions, the Thunder Network and Stroem , have been deployed already.

Myth #4: The Lightning Network requires large payment hubs that will control the network.

Some argue that the Lightning Network will impede some of Bitcoin's most valuable properties, such as decentralization and censorship resistance. According to this argument, the Lightning Network requires large hubs to route most of the payments through. These could then block certain transactions, such as donations to WikiLeaks or other political dissidents.

This argument is largely based on the assessment that the most efficient network configuration – the configuration that requires the least amount of hops from any node to any other node – is a hub-and-spoke model. As such, the Lightning Network might naturally evolve to resemble a hub-and-spoke model, too. Hubs in this network could very well be big Bitcoin entities that almost everyone uses in some way or another already, like exchanges, wallet services and payment processors.

Importantly however, and much like Bitcoin itself, anyone on the Lightning Network can open a payment channel with anyone else at any time. Therefore, if Lightning hubs do emerge, they cannot control the network. Even if all existing hubs refuse to open a channel with WikiLeaks, anyone else still can, hence routing around these hubs. In fact, WikiLeaks could opt to become a hub itself.

Myth #5: Lightning hubs will infringe on users’ privacy.

While it is simply impossible for potential hubs on the Lightning Network to control the flow of funds, a slightly more accurate criticism of the system is that these hubs might be able to keep track of payments on the network. Since most of the transactions will route through these hubs, they could observe the flow of funds, impeding on users' privacy.

This could be true. However, all transactions on the Bitcoin network are currently publicly available and traceable by anyone already. On the Lightning Network, on the other hand, many transactions will be seen only by the hub operators. As such, the Lightning Network by default offers more privacy than the Bitcoin network currently does, not less.

Moreover, recent advancements on the Lightning protocol suggest that it should be possible to route transactions on the Lightning Network in a similar way as messages over the Tor network are. This would entail that all nodes on the Lightning Network know only from which directly connected node a transaction came – and to which directly connected node it must be sent. But they would not know which node initiated the transaction, nor at which node it will end up. If this is worked out properly, the Lightning Network could offer far more privacy than the Bitcoin network currently does.

Myth #6: Blockstream will earn fees off of the Lightning Network.

It is sometimes argued that Blockstream is merely, or at least mainly, pushing the Lightning Network (and blocking an increase of the block-size limit) because it plans to earn fees by running a Lightning Network hub.

It's not unlikely that Lightning hubs will indeed charge a fee for their service as a middleman. And since anyone can set up a hub, it's possible that Blockstream might want to do so, too.

But since anyone can set up a hub and earn fees by doing so, it is unlikely that anyone will make a huge profit. In a free market, competition should keep prices competitive, minimizing profit for anyone involved.

In reality, there is very little reason to believe Blockstream aspires to be in the business of being a financial intermediary. So far, nothing indicates that they will want to, nor will they be particularly well positioned to be one.

Myth #7: Blockstream won't make any money off the Lightning Network.

Since Blockstream won't really be able to control the Lightning Network, nor seems likely to make a lot of money by charging fees as a Lightning hub, this begs the question why the company funds its development in the first place.

To answer that question, it should first be noted that Blockstream is by no means pouring huge amounts of capital into the Lightning Network. The company is paying one salary, that of Rusty Russell, and that's it. While we can probably assume that Rusty is doing well, the Lightning Network is by no means a multi-million dollar operation.

Still, that leaves the question why Blockstream is funding Lightning Network development at all.

The most likely answer is that Blockstream is not completely sure either. As far as an explanation from the company goes, it believes that its in-house expertise will somehow be worth money eventually. In a world where millions or even billions use the Lightning Network, Blockstream assumes a profit can be made somehow, for instance through support, training and consulting services.

A comparison has been made to Red Hat. Red Hat, an American multinational software company, has a similar business model for other open-source projects, most notably the Linux operating system. The company provides all sorts of Linux-related services to a host of different clients all across the world. And with an annual revenue of more than $1 billion, Red Hat has been doing quite well indeed – probably much better than any Lightning hub ever will.

Myth #8: The Lightning Network requires a controversial hard fork of the Bitcoin network.

Another argument against the Lightning Network is that it's far from certain that it can be implemented. Much like a block-size limit increase, it is said that enabling the Lightning Network will require controversial changes to the Bitcoin protocol, and perhaps even a hard fork.

The Bitcoin network will indeed require several updates in order to support the Lightning Network. These are, most notably, a solution to the malleability issue (perhaps BIP 62 ) and the option to lock transactions until some future point in time (BIP 65 ). Neither of these adjustments, however, require a hard fork. Instead, they can be soft forked into the protocol, and none of these soft forks seem to be controversial on a technical level.

(Of course, similar changes can be implemented through a hard fork, too, if that were to be preferred. But it would not be necessary.)

Myth #9: Because of the Lightning Network, the block-size limit will not need to be raised.

The Lightning Network is set to enable a virtually unlimited amount of transactions between two connected users, while only recording two transactions on the actual Bitcoin blockchain. As such, the Lightning Network is sometimes hailed – either implicitly or explicitly – as the savior of Bitcoin that will solve all scalability issues.

While the Lightning Network could, indeed, potentially help solve the scaling problem to a large extent, it is quite an exaggeration to claim that no further block-size increase will be needed at all. If Bitcoin does grow to its full potential, and the Lightning Network is used by billions around the globe on a daily basis, these users will still need to transact on the Bitcoin blockchain in order to open and close channels once in a while. If that happens, it’s safe to assume that 1 megabyte blocks will be too limiting.

In fact, Poon and Dryja acknowledge that the block-size limit would need to be raised in their white paper, estimating:

“If we presume that a decentralized payment network exists and one person will make 3 blockchain transactions per year on average, Bitcoin will be able to support over 35 million users with 1MB blocks in ideal circumstances (assuming 2000 transactions per MB). This is quite limited, and an increase of the block size may be necessary to support everyone in the world using Bitcoin.... While it may appear as though this system will mitigate the block size increases in the short term, if it achieves global scale, it will necessitate a block size increase in the long term.”

It should also be noted that the Lightning Network is not merely intended as a solution for scalability. It could also securely enable instant confirmations for the first time, and make microtransactions worth fractions of a cent economically feasible again. In fact, if these properties draw in a lot of new Bitcoin users, deployment of the Lightning Network might actually pose a challenge for Bitcoin’s scalability issue on the shorter term.

Myth #10: The Lightning Network is an easy fix.

While debating the block-size issue, some on the decentralist side contend that the Lightning Network will simply solve most of Bitcoin's scalability problems. This sometimes makes the solution sound like an easy fix. It is not.

For one, the Lightning protocol itself is still a work in progress. Rusty Russell, Poon, Dryja and others are doing their best to realize the project(s), but this is a long and slow process. Even the concept itself is not set in stone yet, and several problems still need solving. As such, it’s not quite certain the the Lightning Network will indeed work as promised.

Furthermore, and as stated above, the Bitcoin protocol itself will need improvements for the Lightning Network to be deployed securely. Some of the required fixes, moreover, are not that easy to implement, and, much like the Lightning Network itself, are still a work in progress. As such, they might take quite some time to deploy – if they are ever deployed at all.

Lastly, wallet software will need to adjust as well. The most likely outcome here would be that individual wallets – Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin XT, Electrum, mobile wallets, etc. – will include some kind of add-on. Users would then have the option to make a blockchain transaction, or use the Lightning Network instead. But like much of the rest of the Lightning Network, specifics of how this will work or what it would look like exactly are not yet fully flushed out.

Myth #11: The Lightning Network is urgently needed.

This 11th “myth” is more of a controversy than a myth.

It should first be noted that it is hard to say with certainty how urgently instant and (dirt) cheap transactions are needed. These properties have not really existed on the Bitcoin network so far, making it hard to asses how much demand there will be for these properties.

It is more commonly assumed that the Lightning Network is urgently needed to address scalability issues. The fact that the Lightning Network is far from ready is one reason some progressives have urged an increase in the block-size limit instead. If blocks fill up, they argue, fees might rise to undesirable levels, transactions will be too slow to confirm (or not confirm at all), and Bitcoin could even become overloaded. With no alternatives such as the Lightning Network, the outcome would be bad – perhaps even devastating.

As stated above, it is definitely true that the Lightning Network is far from ready. Luckily, however, blocks are not yet filling up either, at least not in such a way that it causes great trouble. Even Bitcoin XT developers Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen – the two most prominent advocates of bigger blocks – acknowledge that it will probably take another year before this starts to happen. (Others believe it will take longer.) That means the Lightning Network probably has at least another year to deploy and gain traction.

Whether that is enough time is debatable. In one of his blog posts, Hearn argues that there are no credible technical proposals that could gain widespread adoption within one year, including the Lightning Network. Others, however, have been a bit more optimistic. While a year is not an awful lot of time to deploy something like the Lightning Network on a large scale, Bitcoin moves fast, and it’s not impossible either.

But more importantly, many on the decentralist side of the debate argue that full blocks wouldn’t be that big of a problem in the first place. Fees may rise a bit, and not all transactions would confirm within the first available block, but that would be fine. If this is true, it might take years before the Lightning Network is really, urgently needed for scalability reasons.

2016/1/21,"Amid Bitcoin Scaling Debate, Segregated Witness Testnet Enters Public Stage","In the midst of a heated debate over block size and Bitcoin’s future, Bitcoin Core developers Dr. Pieter Wuille, Eric Lombrozo and Johnson Lau have launched a third iteration of the Segregated Witness “testnet.” Dubbed SegNet, the latest version of the Bitcoin test network includes several improvements over its predecessors, and is available to anyone who wants to try it or experiment.

SegNet, like the previous versions, is essentially a clone of Bitcoin, specifically intended as a demo version. But while the two earlier SegNets were open only to developers working on the project, now everyone can use it.

Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Ciphrex CEO and Segregated Witness developer Lombrozo said:

“All wallet and other app developers are invited to test and experiment with the latest version of SegNet, and offer feedback. We’ve opened up an IRC channel on Freenode, #segnet-dev, and welcome all discussion pertaining to integrating and supporting Segregated Witness transactions in wallets. Many developers have already joined the effort. I’m happy to see the excitement and enthusiasm, and hope many others will join, too.”

Segregated Witness, the talked-about centerpiece of the scalability “roadmap” proposed by Bitcoin Core, is set to introduce several significant improvements to the Bitcoin network. Most important, it allows for an increased number of transactions by circumventing the original 1-megabyte block size limit, using an add-on to existing blocks called the “witness.” This could increase the effective block size up to some 1.75 to 2 megabytes, depending on the types of transactions.

“Compared to earlier SegNet versions, this latest iteration includes four main improvements,” said Lombrozo, whose mSIGNA wallet will implement Segregated Witness once it is rolled out. “First off, we moved the ‘add-on anchor’ - the Merkle root of the witness – to a different part of the coinbase transaction. We did some research, and as it turns out that works better for existing mining-hardware. Second, we changed the signature hashing algorithm such that verification requires fewer steps. This makes running a full node less burdensome, closes off a denial-of-service vector that is particularly nasty for bigger blocks, and decreases block relay time over the network. Third, transaction input values will be signed. This prevents some fringe attack vectors, where users can accidentally pay too high a fee. And fourth, we lowered the cost for typical, non-multisig transactions. Since these are still in the majority on the network, that should increase total throughput.”

One of the interesting attributes of Segregated Witness, as first presented at the Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Hong Kong, is that it can be rolled out as a soft fork. This means that to use it, only miners need to change their software; all other users can “opt-in” if and when they choose to. For this and other reasons, the Bitcoin Core development team prefers soft forks over hard forks, which require a synchronized network-wide switch of all users.

Over the past week, however, the idea of implementing Segregated Witness as a soft fork came under increased scrutiny. The team behind the recently launched Bitcoin Classic implementation believes that a change in fee policy is undesirable, questions whether the increased transaction throughput will be sufficient, and points out that there is a security degradation for nodes that don’t upgrade to the latest version of the software. Critics also maintain that the proposed soft fork method requires an “ugly” hack, which could complicate development of wallet and app software.

The Bitcoin Core development team, however, maintains that the security tradeoffs are highly theoretical and negligible, and far fewer than those associated with a hard fork. They point out that soft forks have been implemented several times before: when multisig was rolled out, or more recently with CheckLockTimeVerify. Core developers also contend that the increased throughput almost equals that of the 2-megabyte hard fork solution planned by Bitcoin Classic, and could in some cases amount to a bit more. They consider the changed fee policy a feature, not a bug, because it incentivizes users to utilize the added space in blocks.

“As for the ‘ugliness’ of the workaround… I’ll lay it out bluntly here,” Lombrozo said. “A simple block size increase via a hard fork puts all of the burden on the infrastructure rather than the app developers. What we’re proposing with Segregated Witness places a little bit of burden on app developers - which we think is fair. As a bonus, it also means these apps will be ready to support much more sophisticated features in the future, such as smart contracts, the Lightning Network and other payment channel solutions. It’s still not a very complicated thing to support, and many wallet developers seem eager and excited by all this.”

Segregated Witness is scheduled to be rolled out in Bitcoin Core and the Bitcoin network by April of this year. BitGo, BitcoinJS, BlockTrail, Breadwallet, Coinkite, Coinomi, Digital Bitbox, EI8HT, Electrum, GreenAddress, Green Bits, Ledger, Libbitcoin, libbtc, mSIGNA, Mycelium, NBitcoin, Omnicore and Samourai Wallet have indicated support, so far.",Technical,0.9919
2016/2/11,BitPay's Stephen Pair: Community Needs to Become Proficient at Managing Bitcoin Forks,"As opposing sides in Bitcoin's long-lasting scaling dispute seem to be inching closer, one of the remaining sources of contention is not whether, but how to achieve a small block size bump.

The Bitcoin Core development team wants to increase the maximum block capacity through a Segregated Witness soft fork, which has since been embraced by a large part of Bitcoin’s development community and a significant segment of the Bitcoin industry.

Others, like CEO of major payment processor BitPay Stephen Pair, believe the perceived benefits of soft forks over hard forks are being overstated.

Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Pair explained:

“I think soft forks aren't the panacea that many people perceive them to be. It's true that not all nodes on the network need to upgrade at the same time with a soft fork. But once the majority of hashing power has adopted new consensus rules, anyone running a full node should probably want to upgrade to validate the new transaction semantics. And this is especially true when you consider that SPV-nodes make the assumption that peers are performing full validation to keep miners in check.”

 A centerpiece of Bitcoin Core’s scalability “road map,” Segregated Witness is set to increase the effective block size to some 1.6 megabytes to 2 megabytes by moving signature data into a new data structure. Pair is skeptical, however, that Segregated Witness should be considered a short-term scaling solution.

“Segregated Witness would completely change the structure of a Bitcoin transaction, and shouldn't be rushed,” Pair said. “It needs a lot of time to be tested and widely supported. I'm not certain how contorted the implementation has to be to deploy it as a soft fork, but this is code we'll have to live with for a long time. The more complex the Bitcoin validation code becomes, the more vulnerable it will be to various types of attack. A cleaner implementation done as a hard fork might be preferable.”

On Hard Forks

Pair himself initially signed an industry letter in support of BIP 101, the proposal by former Bitcoin Core lead developer Gavin Andresen intended to increase the block size limit to 8 megabytes, then doubling every other year for the next 20 years. He later said he preferred Blockstream president Adam Back's “BIP 248,” an informal proposal to raise the limit to 8 megabytes over four years. And more recently, Pair pitched his own solution: a dynamic block size cap to automatically re-adjust based on recent transaction volume. Additionally, the BitPay CEO is willing to accept a one-time block size increase, such as a hard fork block size limit increase as proposed by Bitcoin Classic.

Pair did add, however, that a hard fork shouldn't be thought of too lightly:

“The big risk of a hard fork is that non-upgraded nodes would go off on a defunct fork and they would be vulnerable to double-spend attacks. With a hard fork, you need to make sure people have plenty of time to upgrade. There is a need to come up with good engineering solutions to managing either type of fork; Version Bits as described in BIP-9 is a good start.”

On Firm Forks

An alternative proposal to increase the block size limit is sometimes referred to as a “firm fork” or a “soft hardfork.” This could allow a majority of miners to change any consensus rules, including those that would typically require a hard fork. But as opposed to both hard forks and soft forks, it would render non-upgraded nodes completely unable to detect any new transactions.

“While the additional complexity of implementing it may not be worth the effort, you could perform a hard fork where miners effectively DOS old nodes by merge mining empty blocks under the old consensus rules,” Pair explained. “I think that would make hard forks a lot safer. People will still have to upgrade, but for those that neglect to upgrade, it will be immediately apparent as it will seem that no transactions are being included in their chain.”

This proposal has itself sparked some controversy, to the point where some dubbed it an “evil soft fork.” Since users would no longer be able to opt-out of a change, they'd have to follow the rules as decided on by miners – or create a new chain.

Pair is not too worried about these consequences, however:

“A user would either want to follow the longest chain, or explicitly go off on a weaker fork. Either way, he would need to upgrade. A firm fork would ensure that the old chain is no longer functional. But whether it's hard forks or soft forks or firm forks... the important thing is that we, as a community, need to become proficient at managing changes of consensus rules.”",Technical,0.6891
2016/2/14,Bitcoin Roundtable Announcement Thwarts Bitcoin Classic Launch,"Bitcoin Classic, the Bitcoin implementation set to double Bitcoin's 1 megabyte block size limit by a hard fork, suffered a significant setback shortly after its official release this week. A group of prominent exchanges, mining pools and other industry players organized under the “Bitcoin Roundtable” collective, stated publicly they will not switch to Bitcoin Classic for the present.

Open Letter

An open letter by the Bitcoin Roundtable, including signatories representing major Bitcoin exchange Bitfinex, ASIC-manufacturer and mining pool BitFury, exchange, wallet service and mining pool BTCC, cloud hashing service Genesis Mining, mining pools F2Pool, BW Pool, Ghash.IO and others, states:

“We think any contentious hard-fork contains additional risks and potentially may result in two incompatible blockchain versions, if improperly implemented. To avoid potential losses for all bitcoin users, we need to minimize the risks. It is our firm belief that a contentious hard-fork right now would be extremely detrimental to the bitcoin ecosystem.”

Bitcoin Classic requires a 75 percent hash power activation threshold to activate a block size limit increase. Since the Bitcoin Roundtable collective accounts for more than 60 percent of hash power on the Bitcoin network today, activation seems unlikely unless some of the signatories reverse their positions.

Instead, the letter expresses support for an initial block size limit increase through Segregated Witness. This solution, which was made a first step in Bitcoin Core's scalability “roadmap,” offers an effective block size limit increase of .6 megabyte to 1 megabyte, along with additional improvements. As one of its main benefits, Segregated Witness can be rolled out as a soft fork, meaning only miners need to upgrade, rather than all nodes on the Bitcoin network.

The letter reads:

“We see the need for a modest block size increase in order to move the Bitcoin project forward, but we would like to do it with minimal risk, taking the safest and most balanced route possible. [Segregated Witness] is almost ready and we support its deployment as a step in scaling.”

Bitcoin Roundtable

Bitcoin Classic was first introduced a month ago by former Bitcoin Foundation board member Olivier Janssens, FinalHash CTO Marshall Long and Bitcoin miner and developer Jonathan Toomim. Shortly after Bitcoin XT lead developer Mike Hearn very publicly denounced Bitcoin a failed experiment, the alternative implementation quickly gained support from major Bitcoin industry players including Coinbase, Blockchain and Bitstamp, as well as Bitcoin Core veterans Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik.

Several major mining pools initially endorsed Bitcoin Classic as well, but this support has been nuanced since. In the midst of a crisis atmosphere, mining pools and other companies organized several meetings across the world as well as online to discuss the situation. One of these meetings, the Bitcoin Consensus Round Table organized by BitFury a day after the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, formed the basis of what later resulted in the Bitcoin Roundtable letter.

Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, BitFury CIO Alex Petrov explained:

“BitFury was ready to support the Bitcoin Classic initiative – but this doesn't mean we planned to immediately start mining in favor of Bitcoin Classic or run Bitcoin Classic nodes. We do believe a hard fork block size limit increase must happen, but we ultimately want to avoid too much confrontation among miners, or a split within the community. This is not helping to move the Bitcoin project forward in any way. Rather, we should have a constructive conversation, start talking, get the perspectives from both sides of the debate. That way everyone can get a deeper understanding of potential issues, and we will be able to find solutions.”

This call for unity was seconded by cloud hashing service Genesis Mining CFO Marco Krohn.

“There is huge split in the community regarding the block size limit. The dispute has been going on for a while, first with Bitcoin XT and now between Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Core. But I think it's important to realize that both sides want Bitcoin to succeed; assuming anyone has bad intentions is not helpful,” Krohn said.

And, regarding concrete scaling proposals:

“Segregated Witness is a great idea, and almost everyone supports it. However, it's only a one-time capacity increase. There were several official and unofficial attempts to convince the Bitcoin Core development team to add a 2 megabyte block size limit increase hard fork to the roadmap, and be more specific about its implementation – but to no avail so far. The letter is an attempt to calm the situation, and to continue the constructive conversation with the Bitcoin Core development team. We are optimistic to find a solution which better addresses the needs of the businesses, miners and the rest of the community.”

China

Previously, a subset of the Chinese mining community – most notably including major ASIC-manufacturer and mining pool Bitmain/AntPool – offered Bitcoin Core an alternative proposal. Rather than switching to Bitcoin Classic, involved companies proposed to raise the block size limit to 2 megabytes, but with a 90 percent hash power support requirement. This sentiment was later echoed by Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu, who said that AntPool will test Bitcoin Classic but does not support rolling out a hard fork block size limit increase in the short term. And, on its own Internet forum, Bitmain clarified it will not vow loyalty to any development team in specific:

“We applaud the [Bitcoin] Core team's increased communication and willingness to find compromise, but we do not wish to bind ourselves to a document that does not contain concrete technical proposals. We look forward to reviewing Bitcoin Core's updated roadmap and evaluating it on its technical merits, but we do not believe that this should be done to the exclusion of other development efforts.”

One of the driving forces behind the Bitcoin Roundtable letter, BTCC COO Samson Mow, acknowledged he does not expect a sudden switch to support Bitcoin Classic from mining pools, if there is any switch at all. Rather, he explained that the Bitcoin Roundtable has even broader support than the letter suggests.

“Bitcoin Classic often overstates their support, or misconstrues support for 2 megabytes or a hard fork as support for Bitcoin Classic,” Mow said. “Some companies not on the signatory list have given a commitment to not run Bitcoin Classic until we see if Bitcoin Core can adapt. They support the Bitcoin Roundtable, but they would have preferred a more strongly worded request to Core, and so have refrained from signing. That was the compromise we reached.”

Mow agreed the main goal right now is to get more clarity from Bitcoin Core on the proposed scalability roadmap, and said the Bitcoin Roundtable group will help to facilitate as needed.

Mow:

“Everyone is asking for a hard fork, but no one is talking about what exactly will go into the hard fork. Is it cleaning up the code a Segregated Witness soft fork left behind? Is it an increase to 2 megabytes or more? What will be the requirements for activation? We need to have those discussions together.”

Bitcoin Classic

While the Bitcoin Roundtable letter was a setback, Janssens, listed as “facilitator” in the Bitcoin Classic release notes, has not given up hope for Bitcoin Classic. Addressing visitors of the r/btc subreddit, predominantly frequented by bitcoiners in favor of a hard fork block size increase, Janssens made clear that Bitcoin Classic intends to remain active – even if it does not achieve a hash rate majority in the short term.

“Classic is here to stay. We finally have a great competing client with a lot of traction,” Janssens said. “Don't let the recent letter discourage you. We still have double digits coming on board of Classic soon, and the rest will follow quickly when the fee event will take place in the next weeks. We cannot run away from reality, and the time for more talk and debate is over. The block size limit will be hit very soon.”

Additionally, at least one mining pool so far stated public support for Bitcoin Classic. Slush Pool, accounting for some 4 percent of total hash power, has committed to let individual miners vote on a potential block size limit increase.

Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Slush Pool operator Marek “Slush” Palatinus explained:

“I still like Bitcoin XT or even solutions which remove block size limit completely, but consider it a politically dead solution, so there's no point in pushing it over and over. I therefore support Bitcoin Classic, as it seems to be a trade-off for both camps. And I'm generally not afraid of hard forks much; I'm even a proponent of regular hard forks – say, once a year – which would be able to reflect recent development in [the] field of cryptocurrencies.”

And the Bitcoin Roundtable signatories, in the end, did not completely exclude a switch to Bitcoin Classic at some point in the future either. If after three weeks the Bitcoin Core development team has not addressed concerns raised by the letter signatories, some of them might still opt to make a switch.

BitFury's Petrov said:

“We don't want to raise any aggression or conflicts with either the Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Classic development teams. Quite the opposite: We would like to build a communication bridge between them. We are just searching for the most optimal and efficient decision – between all voices and with the least risk. We already set the date for next meeting in the end of February, and we would like to discuss the issue with the Bitcoin Classic team to hear their perspective as well. Right now it seems more logical to roll-out Segregated Witness first, and prepare for a hard fork after that. But the Roundtable Group is comprised of many companies and people with differing views, and as initiators we don't want to make any decisions ourselves.”",Technical,-0.1027
2016/2/15,Bitcoin Core Developer Eric Lombrozo: Many Incentives to Implement SegWit,"Although Segregated Witness (SegWit) has near-universal support from the Bitcoin development community, there are some who say the changes required by individual wallet providers may be a bit too much to handle. 

But on a recent episode of Epicenter Bitcoin, Bitcoin Core Contributor and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo indicated that the complexities involved with these required changes have been overblown. While making his case for Segregated Witness, Lombrozo noted the Bitcoin wallet developers he’s worked with have been able to implement this change in a matter of days.

Not a Big Change

Lombrozo was asked how difficult it will be for wallet developers to implement Segregated Witness. The Ciphrex CEO talked about his own experience assisting wallet developers with the SegWit integration:

“It’s actually not that big of a change. The wallet developers we’ve worked with -- we’re able to implement it within a couple of days, you know, less than a week. It is something that is not very, very difficult at all.”

Lombrozo noted that there are some changes that will have to be made in wallets that wish to reap the benefits of SegWit, but these changes are minor. He explained:

“It does require some changes. It’s something that some people in the space have kind of -- were hoping that they wouldn’t have to change anything -- but I think as far as changes go, this is a very, very minor change.”

Lombrozo’s comments on the difficulties of getting Segregated Witness to work with a particular wallet echo statements made by Blocktrail CTO and BitcoinJS co-maintainer Ruben de Vries in a recent interview with Bitcoin Magazine.

The Benefits of SegWit for Multisig Transactions

In addition to the relative simplicity of integrating SegWit into a wallet, Lombrozo also commented on the benefits of this new feature for multisig transactions. He explained:

“Multisig transactions with SegWit are much cleaner in a lot of ways. It allows us to stick the signatures into the structure in a way which is much, much cleaner than the way we’re doing it right now. Also, with multisig transactions, the throughput increase is greater than with non-multisig transactions.”

The second part of Lombrozo’s statement has to do with Segregated Witness’s ability to allow more transactions to be stuffed into blocks. Because multisig transactions involve more signatures, the space saved via SegWit is amplified.

Wallet Developers Have Incentives to Implement SegWit

Eric Lombrozo also pointed out in the Epicenter Bitcoin interview that Bitcoin wallet developers have economic incentives to upgrade to Segregated Witness. In short, users will demand the enhanced functionality offered by this alteration to how Bitcoin works. Lombrozo explained:

“You want to upgrade to SegWit for all of the features that it offers. I think there’s a lot of economic incentives built into this already. People are going to want to do it because it’s makes it possible for them to give better products to their users.”

Epicenter Bitcoin co-host Sébastien Couture pointed out that the ability to fit more transactions into each block should also enable lower fees for wallet users. Lombrozo agreed with this assessment and added:

“In principle, the transaction throughput itself in the block is going to be smaller -- miners can fit more of these transactions in a block. So yes, this means that fees, in principle, could be lower.”

Having said that, Lombrozo somewhat backed off the notion of lower fees as a key feature of Segregated Witness over the short term because prioritization of transactions based on fees is not a major aspect of the Bitcoin network at this time.",Technical,0.3182
2016/2/20,Technical Roadblock Ahead? New Research Paper Warns of Future Bitcoin Network Scaling Concerns,"MIT Technology Review is weighing in again on the issue of Bitcoin scalability with an article titled “Technical Roadblock Might Shatter Bitcoin Dreams.” The question is whether the Bitcoin network could be scaled up to support thousands of transactions per second, like the world’s major payment networks. The answer is no, unless the Bitcoin code is radically re-engineered.

The debate has been going on for months. In May 2015, Bitcoin Magazine reported that Bitcoin Core developers were disagreeing on the optimal block size, a parameter that is directly related to the throughput of the Bitcoin network. As things stand, the Bitcoin network can process only a few transactions per second, which could strongly limit the ability of the network to handle high transaction volumes if the adoption of bitcoin payments grows.

On February 26 a team of researchers from Cornell University, The University of California, Berkeley, ETH Zurich, the National University of Singapore, and the University of Maryland, will present a paper titled ""On Scaling Decentralized Blockchains"" at the Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2016 conference, organized by the International Financial Cryptography Association and IACR.

Author Ari Juels, a cryptographer and professor at the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute at Cornell Tech and a director of the Initiative for Crypto-Currencies and Contracts (IC3), is persuaded that the scaling proposals currently on the table for discussion, centered on increasing the block size, would have little effect. 

In fact, according to Juels, no tweak to Bitcoin could allow transactions at a scale close to the thousands of transactions per second processed by global payment networks such as Visa, without compromising Bitcoin's decentralized design. “We have to think in terms of a fundamental redesign if we’re going to see robust scaling in Bitcoin,” said Juels.

“Today’s representative blockchain such as Bitcoin takes 10 min or longer to confirm transactions, achieves 7 transactions/sec maximum throughput,” note the researchers. “In comparison, a mainstream payment processor such as Visa credit card confirms a transaction within seconds, and processes 2000 transactions/sec on average, with a peak rate of 56,000 transactions/sec.” 

Bitcoin works by discovering blocks of confirmed transactions at approximate intervals, and its transaction throughput is limited by factors like the maximum block size, the average transaction size, and the block interval.

After an extensive analysis of the factors that limit the throughput of the Bitcoin network, the researchers conclude that reparametrization of the block size and interval in Bitcoin is only a first step toward substantial throughput and latency improvements while retaining significant system decentralization. 

“More aggressive scaling will in the longer term require fundamental protocol redesign,” note the researchers.

A conclusion of the study is that, in the current design of Bitcoin Core, there is a fundamental conflict between throughput and decentralization. An optimal block size of four megabytes could permit a throughput of about 27 transactions per second in the Bitcoin network, but the price to pay for further increases would be making the Bitcoin system more centralized. 

For example, using a standard Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) replication protocol with a small number of pre-designated trusted entities would permit improved scaling, but decentralization carries a performance cost.

The discussion of the possible ways ahead is rather theoretical and generic, and the researchers don’t propose a solution. The goal, they say, “is not to propose an end-to-end system, but rather to paint the design space, suggest promising approaches, and pose open challenges to the community.” 

The promising approaches outlined by the researchers include lightning networks and sidechains able to exploit faster and more efficient protocols while still using Bitcoin as a currency.

MIT Technology Review notes that many companies are developing private non-Bitcoin blockchains and “permissioned” blockchains where transactions can be validated only by vetted participants. Private blockchains that don’t require high throughput, for example those envisaged for inter-bank settlements, are less vulnerable to congestion than the public Bitcoin blockchain.

Legendary cryptographer Adam Back, a co-founder of Blockstream, a well-funded company active in the lightning networks and sidechains space, agrees that new technology is needed to scale up Bitcoin, but is persuaded that the community will be up to the challenge. “There’s strong interest from academia, lots of new technology coming in the next 18 months, and a lot of funding coming to the industry,” he says, as reported by MIT Technology Review.

2016/2/23,Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 Released: What's New?,"Today marks the official release of Bitcoin Core 0.12.0, the twelfth generation of Bitcoin's reference client as first launched by Satoshi Nakamoto seven years ago. Developed by close to 100 contributors over seven months, the latest version of Bitcoin Core includes more than 20 improvements, particularly regarding performance, security and usability.

These are the sixth most notable changes.

Memory Pool Limiting

Memory pools are the collections of unconfirmed transactions as stored individually by all full nodes. Memory pools fill up in between blocks as new transactions are transmitted over the Bitcoin network and are depleted when these transactions are included in blocks. But if a series of subsequent blocks remain full for an extended period – either due to legitimate transactions or spam attacks – memory pools might not deplete completely, and backlogs could build up. With no maximum limit, the backlog might even grow to the point where nodes run out of memory and crash. (This is the “crash landing” scenario former Bitcoin XT lead developer Mike Hearn feared.)

Memory pool limiting, as the name suggests, enforces a hard limit on the maximum size of memory pools to prevent this scenario. If the maximum is reached, nodes reject or clear their memory pools of transactions that offer the lowest amount of fees per byte.

Full node operators can configure their limits, but the default maximum size in Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 is set on 300 megabytes.

Blockchain Pruning for Wallet Users

One of the burdens of running a full node is the requirement to store the complete blockchain. This adds up to 55 gigabytes at the time of this writing, and can grow another 50 gigabytes per year under the current 1-megabyte block size limit.

To decrease this requirement, Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 allows users to prune the blockchain, which means they can get rid of older data once their node has verified it. The amount of data to keep is configurable, though Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 will still require a minimum 2 gigabytes of disk space.

Pruning the blockchain does mean these nodes will no longer be able to share all the blockchain data with peers, such as full nodes syncing with the network for the first time.

(It should be noted that pruning the blockchain was first introduced in Bitcoin Core 0.11.0, but was not yet available for users running Bitcoin Core as a wallet.)

Upload Traffic Limiting

Full nodes continually transmit and relay transactions and blocks to each other over Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer network. This typically requires a modest amount of data to be downloaded, but sharing that same data with several peers at the same time can add up to significant upload costs.

Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 introduces a configurable data cap for upload traffic. If this cap comes within reach, the node will seize uploading blocks older than a week, typically requested by nodes first syncing with the network. Additionally, any light clients will be disconnected and no longer served any block data.

Opt-in Replace-by-fee

As the number of transactions on the Bitcoin network increases, not all transactions might fit into blocks. As such, miners will probably pick the transactions sent by users who included most fees. This means that some transactions – from users that paid too low a fee – could never confirm at all. And since many full nodes and miners currently reject conflicting transactions (sent from the same inputs as an earlier transaction), low fee transactions can get “stuck” on the network.

To solve this, Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 introduces opt-in replace-by-fee. If a transaction is sent using opt-in replace-by-fee, users can replace their own transaction with a newer transaction by including a higher fee. (This also means that miners can increase their income, as they get to pick transactions that include higher fees.)

The “opt-in” part of opt-in replace-by-fee means these types of transactions will not be the default, and will be flagged as replace-by-fee transactions on the Bitcoin network. Anyone relying on zero-confirmation transactions should want to monitor for these replace-by-fee transactions, as these could very easily be reverted until they are confirmed. (Of course, zero-confirmation transactions were never secure.)

Whether opt-in replace-by-fee will actually be useful depends on Bitcoin miners; they ultimately decide which transactions to include in blocks, and under what policies.

Tor by Default

While Bitcoin is often claimed to provide anonymity to users, this is not entirely true. Bitcoin users can be de-anonymized, for example, through the peer-to-peer network. If it is determined from which IP-address a transaction originated, this information can be used to identify Bitcoin users.

To protect users' privacy, Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 automatically connects to the Bitcoin network through anonymizing tool Tor (The Onion Router) – if Tor is installed on the same computer. Tor encrypts data and routes it through several nodes all across the world before broadcasting it. This makes it hard – perhaps impossible – to trace where a Bitcoin transaction originated.

(It should be noted that using Tor in itself might not be sufficient to protect a Bitcoin user’s identity. See Bitcoin Magazine's Beginners Guide to Bitcoin Privacy for more information.)

Faster Signature Validation

Signatures are the cryptographic trick where private keys are “combined” with any other data to calculate a unique string of numbers. Corresponding public keys can be used to verify that the signatures were created using the private keys. In Bitcoin's case, signatures are effectively used to prove ownership of bitcoin, and, as such, to validate transactions.

But there are several ways to conduct this cryptographic trick, which could result in different signatures – all valid in their own way. And if different Bitcoin nodes apply different methods for validation, some nodes might consider certain transactions valid while other nodes do not, which could split the Bitcoin network.

Following up on a soft fork to solve this problem last year, Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 now switches all validation from the “OpenSSL” cryptographic library to “libsecp256k1”, developed by Dr. Pieter Wuille, Gregory Maxwell and other Bitcoin Core developers.

As an added benefit, this new signature validation scheme requires less CPU-power, lowering the cost of running a full node and significantly decreasing block validation time.

For a full list of improvements, see Bitcoin Core 0.12.0's release notes on GitHub.

2016/2/24,MIT Media Lab Director Joi Ito Speaks Up on Bitcoin Technical Development Environment,"A recent MIT Technology Review article covered by Bitcoin Magazine, titled “Technical Roadblock Might Shatter Bitcoin Dreams,” asks whether the Bitcoin network could be scaled up to support thousands of transactions per second, like the world’s major payment networks, and concludes that the answer is no, unless the Bitcoin code is radically re-engineered.

“Today’s representative blockchain such as Bitcoin takes 10 min or longer to confirm transactions, achieves 7 transactions/sec maximum throughput,” notes a recent research paper. “In comparison, a mainstream payment processor such as Visa credit card confirms a transaction within seconds, and processes 2000 transactions/sec on average, with a peak rate of 56,000 transactions/sec.”  The researchers conclude that, in the current design of Bitcoin Core, there is a fundamental conflict between throughput and decentralization.

Joi Ito, director of the MIT Media Lab, is persuaded that the development community will find ways to scale Bitcoin eventually, but warns that the process could take too long to meet the expectations of some investors and Bitcoin companies. “I think there are some businesses that have promised returns based on the scaling that are not really reasonable,” said Ito, according to the  MIT Technology Review article. 

Ito’s MIT Media Lab hosts the Digital Currency initiative, directed by former White House senior adviser for mobile and data innovation Brian Forde. The Digital Currency Initiative wants to bring together global experts in areas ranging from cryptography to economics to privacy to distributed systems, to play a key role in Bitcoin technical development. According to Ito, the Media Lab should be an independent, neutral home to help with Bitcoin standards development. Three Bitcoin Core developers -- Gavin Andresen, Cory Fields, and Wladimir van der Laan -- have joined the MIT Media Lab.

The launch of the MIT Digital Currency initiative and the “takeover” of three Bitcoin Core developers including Andresen, probably the best known and most influential Bitcoin developer, has been widely interpreted as a claim for technical leadership in the Bitcoin development space. Therefore, it’s important to understand MIT Media Lab’s position in the ongoing Bitcoin scaling debate.

Now, Joi Ito is beginning to weigh in with an article titled “My view on the current situation of Bitcoin and the Blockchain.” In the article, which promises to be the first of a series, Ito notes that the core developers of Bitcoin, who find themselves at home working on cryptography, systems, networks and code, are now unable to interface effectively with the commercial interests whose businesses depend on scaling the technology. They can only do their best, but their best isn’t good enough for “those who don't understand the architecture or the nature of what is going on inside of Bitcoin,” says Ito.

“If you try to build ‘something like Bitcoin but better!’ it will probably turn out insecure, underwhelming, and will go against the the fundamental principles that give Bitcoin the potential to be as impactful to banking, law and society as the Internet has been to media, communication, and commerce,” says Ito, noting many relevant parallels between the recent history of Bitcoin and the somewhat longer history of Internet protocols. “Governments and banks are launching all kind of plans without enough thought going into how they're actually going to build the secure ledger.” 

This seems a direct jab to the many companies and institutions that are betting on non-Bitcoin blockchains and “permissioned” blockchains where transactions can be validated only by vetted participants. Ito seems to agree with legendary cryptographer Nick Szabo, who believes banks and state actors should embrace the crowd-sourced power and resiliency of permissionless blockchains like Bitcoin. 

Ito concludes by expressing hope that the Bitcoin community will find ways to “handle the inevitable disagreements in the future in a less emotional and more technical and operational way.”

In related news, representatives from the Bitcoin industry and members of the development community, congregated in a “Bitcoin Roundtable,” have reached an agreement on some of the controversial technical and operational development issues that Ito seems to allude to. The Bitcoin Core developers who signed the agreement include Fields, but not the other two developers -- Andresen and van der Laan -- supported by the MIT Media Lab. The official position of Ito and the Digital Currency Initiative on the Bitcoin Roundtable solution hasn’t been disclosed at the moment.",Technical,0.9977
2016/2/25,Gavin Andresen: Bitcoin Core Is Not Listening to Its Customers,"In a recent interview with Let’s Talk Bitcoin, Bitcoin Foundation Chief Scientist Gavin Andresen explained his issues with Bitcoin Core and why he has decided to help the Bitcoin Classic project. 

Bitcoin Classic is an implementation of an alternative Bitcoin protocol that would cause a hard fork with a 75 percent activation threshold in order to increase the block size limit from 1 megabyte to 2 megabytes.

During the interview, Andresen said Bitcoin Core developers are not listening to miners and the entities that are creating many of the transactions on the Bitcoin network. He also discussed his future plans as a developer in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

The Market Will Decide What’s Best

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has routinely referred to the Bitcoin Classic vs. Bitcoin Core debate as an election, and Andresen appeared to agree with this sentiment during the interview. In terms of the possibility of Bitcoin Classic taking over as the reference implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, Andresen noted:

“The market will decide. That’s kind of where the rubber meets the road with Bitcoin is what software people decide to run.”

Although it’s practically impossible to operate Bitcoin as a direct democracy (and may not be a good idea), support for changes to the consensus rules are often measured via miner support. Miners can broadcast their support for a particular change via a coinbase transaction.

Is Bitcoin Core Listening to Its Customers?

When asked about his main disagreement with the rest of the Bitcoin Core development team (which Andresen is still technically part of), the Bitcoin Classic developer talked about Core’s unwillingness to listen to its users. He stated:

“The root of my issue with [Bitcoin] Core is I just think that they’re not listening to their customers. I don’t think that they’ve been listening to the miners, and I don’t think that they’ve been listening to the people that do the bulk of the transactions on the network.”

The idea that Bitcoin Core is not listening to miners seems somewhat debunked based on the recent Bitcoin Roundtable meeting in Hong Kong, though it should be noted this took place after Andresen’s interview on Let’s Talk Bitcoin was recorded. As a result of the meeting, representatives of roughly 80 percent of the network hashrate were able to come to consensus with a handful of Bitcoin Core contributors on a future hard fork to increase the block size limit. It should be noted that it is unclear whether the agreement from the Bitcoin Roundtable will also reach consensus among the rest of the Bitcoin Core development team.

The level of communication between Bitcoin Core and some of the main creators of Bitcoin transactions, such as Coinbase and Blockchain.info, remains unclear, although Blockstream President Adam Back has publicly invited Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong to the upcoming Satoshi Roundtable, which will have a few Bitcoin Core contributors in attendance.

Companies Taking Matters Into Their Own Hands

With support from Coinbase and Blockchain.info’s Peter Smith, Bitcoin Classic could be an example of these companies taking matters into their own hands. Andresen hinted at the unrest among some Bitcoin companies during his interview:

“We’ve long said that if companies aren’t happy with what Core is doing, then they should either get developers involved in Core or they should start their own projects. And I think companies haven’t been happy with the direction Core is going and haven’t been happy with the priorities that Core has set -- as expressed by, kind of, the code that they’re producing.”

Andresen mentioned that exchanges and wallet providers are some of the loudest proponents of larger blocks due to the way the issue is negatively affecting their companies right now. Indeed, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has been a major supporter of Bitcoin Classic on Twitter and Medium.

Andresen Ready to Contribute to All Bitcoin Projects

When it comes to Gavin Andresen’s own plans for the future, it appears he’s ready to help any Bitcoin project, including Bitcoin Core. He explained:

“I’m happy to contribute to lots of different projects. I think my contributions will wax and wane based on whether I’m researching some interesting new area of computer science that catches my eye or am I done researching and I decide that I actually want to write some code people might actually decide to use.”

2016/2/26,Why Some Changes to Bitcoin Require Consensus: Bitcoin’s 4 Layers,"The long-lasting block size dispute and the recent introduction of several new Bitcoin implementations highlighted that not all Bitcoin nodes apply the exact same rule –  and, perhaps more important, that not all development teams apply similar policies when it comes to implementing these rules.

The development team behind Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin’s historic “reference client,” requires widespread community consensus before it implements rule changes such as raising the block size limit, while other changes are not held to the same standards. 

Meanwhile, some Bitcoin forks, such as Bitcoin LJR, are generally accepted by the development community, while others, such as Bitcoin Classic, attract a lot of controversy. This is considered inconsistent by some.

But this difference can be explained. Certain rule changes, implemented in certain forks, impact the Bitcoin network very differently than others. Or more specifically: Certain rule changes impact very different layers of the Bitcoin network. And some of these rules changes can split the Bitcoin network while others cannot.

To clarify these differences, Bitcoin Core developer and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo recently proposed to tag the relevant layers in all Bitcoin Improvement Proposals. These are the four main layers on the Bitcoin network as specified in his BIP 123, and the respective importance of consensus on each.

The Consensus Rules

The consensus rules are Bitcoin's most important rules. They establish – among many other things – the amount of bitcoins included in the block reward, the mining difficulty, the type of proof-of-work required, and, indeed, the block size limit. 

These rules are so important because they determine which blocks are deemed valid by full nodes. And if all full nodes apply the same consensus rules, it ensures they all maintain an identical copy of the blockchain. 

If different nodes apply different consensus rules, however, they risk accepting blocks that other nodes reject. Such discrepancy could lead to different nodes maintaining completely incompatible versions of the blockchain, effectively splitting the Bitcoin network.

Bitcoin's consensus rules can be changed in two ways. A change that adds extra rules to the protocol (making previously valid blocks invalid) is called a soft fork. Soft forks require a majority of hash power to support the change. The blocks that are produced under the new rules would be valid under the old rules as well, so nodes that didn’t upgrade would still follow the longest chain.

However, non-upgraded miners might produce blocks that are invalid under the new rules, wasting hash power. And non-upgraded full nodes would no longer be able to verify whether blocks adhere to the new rules, requiring them to wait additional confirmations to achieve the same level of security. 

For these and other reasons, the Bitcoin Core development team has said that it will typically require a super-majority of 95 percent of hash power to agree on soft forks.

A consensus rule change that removes rules from the protocol (making previously invalid blocks valid) is called a hard fork. A hard fork requires all full nodes on the network to adopt. Any node that doesn't implement the change might not follow the longest chain at all, as it could consider that chain invalid and stay on the “old” chain instead. This could split the Bitcoin network as described above. How long such a split would persevere is not really a technical question, but rather a debate on politics, sociology, economics, game theory and more.

Soft fork changes to the consensus rules without consensus could – in a worst-case scenario – cause a minority of miners to waste hash power, and (slightly) degrade the security of full nodes.

Hard fork changes to the consensus rules without consensus could – in a worst-case scenario – split the Bitcoin network.

Peer-to-Peer Layer

The peer-to-peer layer of the Bitcoin network covers how full nodes share data and what data they share. This includes protocol rules to send and receive transactions and blocks, as well as special data packages such as Segregated Witnesses or Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables.

Most importantly, the peer-to-peer layer must ensure that new blocks find their way through the entire network, as well as data packages required to verify blocks. If this relay policy fails, it could result in a network split where different nodes hold different versions of the blockchain – at least until blocks find their way through the entire network again.

But as opposed to the consensus rules, it’s not necessarily a huge problem if not every single node applies the exact same relay policy. Since most nodes forward blocks to at least eight peers, this amplifier should ensure that all nodes receive all blocks even if some of them don’t forward properly.

Nodes have even more leeway when it comes to relaying transactions. Most nodes on the Bitcoin network today use a “first seen” policy: If they receive two or more conflicting transactions, they reject the latter. But a growing number of nodes apply variations of “replace-by-fee” policies, meaning they pick the transactions which include the highest fees – regardless of which came first. Additionally, some nodes reject certain types of transactions altogether, or don’t relay any transactions at all.

That said, miners ultimately decide which transactions they include in blocks, and why. It’s only when transaction relay policies vary wildly, or are sufficiently restrictive, that it might become unpredictable which transactions are confirmed for these reasons alone.

Changes to the peer-to-peer layer without consensus could – in a worst-case scenario – split the network. This risk exists if blocks can’t find their way throughout the whole network. The split will, however, automatically resolve once the network is reconnected.

If the changes concern transactions only, they could – in a worst case scenario – prevent certain transactions from confirming. It could also decrease the reliability of unconfirmed transactions. But it cannot split the network.

Application Programming Interfaces and Remote Procedure Calls

The Application Programming Interface (API) and Remote Procedure Call (RPC) layers are communications layers on top of the peer-to-peer protocol. Many Bitcoin software applications – such as mobile wallets and block explorers – communicate with the blockchain through these layers by connecting to an API or software library.

If one of these layers fails, all connected software applications will be unable to reliably communicate with the Bitcoin network. Mobile wallets won't know if they received Bitcoin, and blockchain explorers can't tell whether a new block was found. However, all other Bitcoin users won’t notice a thing; the network itself is still running fine.

Changes to the API and RPC layers without consensus could – in a worst-case scenario – completely disconnect users of these layers from the Bitcoin network. But such changes cannot split the network itself.

Applications

Last, the application layer refers to how Bitcoin software applications create and use certain types of data that doesn’t really touch the network directly, but that is useful to synchronize across applications.

This includes, for example, address formats, private keys generation or wallet back-ups. If one wallet generates an address that another wallet doesn't consider valid, transacting between them will be impossible. Or if one wallet uses one method to create a backup address seed, and another wallet uses another, users can't recover their private keys with each wallet. The same goes for wallet backups.

Changes to the application layers without consensus could – in a worst case scenario – prevent some users from mutually transacting, and cause other inconveniences. Such changes cannot split the network. Thanks go out to Lombrozo for technical guidance.",Technical,-0.9162
2016/2/29,‘Bitcoin Always Needed More Than One Body of Developers’: An Interview With Libbitcoin’s Eric Voskuil,"Launched in 2011 by an ensemble of dedicated open-source developers led by Bitcoin’s rebellious hacker Amir Taaki, Libbitcoin was born a tool of resistance. 

Offering an alternative to the original Bitcoin client, its goal was to diversify the Bitcoin development ecosystem, ensuring no single development team retained effective control over the network. “Centralized software is vulnerable to the dictates of whoever controls development of that software code, and any dictates pressured onto them,” Taaki’s Libbitcoin manifesto reads.

Five years later, Taaki has vanished from the Bitcoin scene. But Libbitcoin, a set of cross-platform, open-source libraries that serve as building blocks for a variety of Bitcoin applications, continues to grow. They are now maintained by a loosely tied team led by Seattle-based software architect and former naval aviator Eric Voskuil, and form the basis of services including Airbitz, DarkWallet (alpha) and OpenBazaar (soon in alpha).

Bitcoin Magazine sat down with Voskuil to learn more about this maverick implementation.

Eric, first of all, what happened to Amir? Do you know what he's up to these days?

Yes.

...Yes?

I'm in touch with him. He's doing well. But it’s not really my place to say more.

OK, so Amir seems gone for now. One of the reasons he launched Libbitcoin was to diversify the development ecosystem. Do these ideals live forth?

I don't speak for other Libbitcoin contributors; each has their own reasons and their own opinions. But Libbitcoin's core values have always been privacy, scalability and integrity. Indeed, if any individual or group can change consensus rules – consensus means agreement by all – Bitcoin’s integrity has been compromised.

Bitcoin, therefore, needs more than one body of main developers. I don't have any issues with the Core guys, technically or philosophically. I truly think they are doing great work and for the right reasons. But that is a sword that can cut both ways. Just as there has been cause for concern in the past – think of the Bitcoin Foundation funding development – we can assume there will be in the future.

Why is a homogeneous development ecosystem such a problem? No one is forced to run the software.

True, but Bitcoin requires decentralization for survival. If there is only one team of experts maintaining the only implementation, the whole ecosystem is extremely weak. If that team ends up on one or two payrolls, or is perhaps co-opted by state actors, there are obvious implications. It's even worse than just having one Web browser, because the lack of diversity in browser choices is not as damaging to people as losing decentralized money.

To be strong, Bitcoin needs expert volunteers working in a global virtual community on various implementations that people actually use. This provides credible balance in the case of real conflict. Libbitcoin is playing the long game, and is making major investments in several important areas. This ultimately complements and improves other implementations, just as it benefits from them.

It's interesting that similar arguments have recently resurfaced. The Bitcoin Classic team in particular maintains that diversifying the development ecosystem is a key goal.

The important benefit of developer diversification is greater resistance to centralization pressure. Libbitcoin is first and foremost a tool of resistance, though to be effective it must also be great technology. A code fork that simply changes a consensus rule because there is not universal agreement is not resistance, it's an attack.

Fortunately, Bitcoin has always anticipated this scenario. The uncertainty may not be good for the exchange price in the short term, and people who aren't paying attention may lose money. But Bitcoin will be stronger for it. Bitcoin has to be able to withstand such attacks.

Increasing the block size limit by one megabyte is an attack?

A dissenter always has the option to start another coin. But an attempt to cause a change in consensus rules without actual consensus is an attempt at theft. Such changes will favor some parties at the expense of others. It's impossible to predict specifically who will be harmed when a money is altered, since value is subjective. But the question becomes moot in the case of consensus. With consensus the change is an increase in value for all, since all prefer the change.

In Bitcoin, larger hash power currently has an increasing advantage as blocks grow in size. Similarly some businesses may benefit from the possibility of higher transaction volume and minimal fee pressure. Except to the extent that these parties are also coin-holders, the theft is not of their value. At the same time they have a financial interest in changing the rules.

I'm not keen on any block size limit increase presently. I assume we may need to do so at some point, but given the minimal fee pressure we see today, there is absolutely no urgency. And given the lack of consensus it would not be appropriate to try.

Wouldn't it be better to avoid rising fees for now, to incentivize adoption? Be a bit more pragmatic?

Decentralization is the purpose of Bitcoin and essential to its existence.

Larger blocks create centralization pressure, an observation that does not seem to be in dispute among developers. And given the current state of the ecosystem, with a handful of pools directing most of the hash power and an apparent declining number of validating users, it seems one megabyte is problematic enough.

By analogy, imagine a door lock company advertising that they have the best locks on the market. People need to be able to get through doors, and their lock makes that really easy, so that the most people possible can get through! The company considers security important ... but not at the expense of ease-of-use. Can this reasonably be described as 'pragmatic'?

If Bitcoin centralizes and succumbs to the censors, it will have nothing to offer its users.

Cheap and fast transactions offer a certain value, don't they?

Sure, but costs are not reduced through the magic of Merkel trees, or some other mundane technology employed by Bitcoin. Costs are reduced by removing the state from the control of money. Censorship resistance is the only way Bitcoin achieves cost benefits over other financial technologies.

PayPal set out to do the same things as Bitcoin, and failed. Upon running afoul of the censors, their business model was forced to change. The cheap, rapid, programmable, international peer-to-peer payments they imagined never materialized.

Similarly, if Bitcoin cannot resist state controls, countless intermediaries, high transaction costs, inflation taxes, bail-ins and state-by-state currency controls will remain the norm, and it won’t be able to achieve lower cost.

Satoshi said Bitcoin should be able to scale on-chain. He thought fees would be cheap, and he said that the block size limit could be lifted when needed.

Look, there is no question whatsoever that the threat Satoshi was working to defeat is the state. And a path to Visa-level transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain is quite clearly a fatal blow to censorship resistance. His explanation of how the block size limit could be raised does not imply any contradiction, it's just Satoshi saying that when a block size increase makes sense it can be done. The decentralist perspective is not that the block size limit can never change.

Scarcity of block space would probably drive transaction fees up as well, to the point where perhaps only the wealthy can transact on-chain. Surely we must compromise somewhere?

I'm aware of these arguments, but this is a 'split-the-difference' negotiating tactic based on a faulty premise. It's sort of like declaring that only the wealthy can fly because aircraft are expensive. But not everyone needs to own a private jet. The analogy in the legacy financial system would be consumers buying a cup of coffee using the SWIFT network directly.

There will inevitably be layering on Bitcoin, as analogous systems have done for centuries.

What's interesting about rebuilding the SWIFT network? What happened to the vision of electronic cash?

The “electronic cash” envisioned by Satoshi is cash; it is not notes, scrip or bank credits. We have come to think of bank notes as cash, but they are actually contracts for debt. The note holder is owed something by the issuer. Cash is a commodity with certain properties that make it useful as money. Cash is largely gone from the world, and people cannot return to physical commodity money, as it cannot be moved online. Bitcoin is really our only option to guard against inflation, counterfeit, capital controls and high costs in general.

And given that bitcoin – lowercase b – is cash, and the blockchain is the definitive truth on where the money is, Bitcoin – uppercase B – is a settlement system. If it wasn't, it must use something else for settlement – and that isn't the case.

Some might take issue with this vision, but that's because they imagine existing banks, financial institutions, and – most importantly – censorship. A global censorship-resistant settlement network is not like anything we've ever seen before. It is, indeed, the goal many people are working towards.

That system will allow people to buy their coffee with electronic cash, but Bitcoin will never carry every coffee purchase on-chain. Those who make the Visa-analogy either don’t understand how Visa works, or don’t understand how Bitcoin works. And let’s not kid ourselves: Users really don't care how their transactions are cleared.

Rising fees might hurt Bitcoin startups as well.

Indeed, much of the block size argument is coming from outside of what I consider Bitcoin. Organizations that operate centralized services, like web-wallets and APIs. The more successful they are, the less decentralized Bitcoin becomes.

What people don't seem to realize is that you can't make money on Bitcoin in the way they are used to making money. A large part of the Bitcoin industry is fumbling around, burning off capital on stupid stuff. It's a common pattern in a new industry, I think. It's an interesting problem, profiting from a system that defies centralization and intermediaries, and that requires free software. ... But Bitcoin doesn’t exist to be a profit vehicle for startups.

So how do you suggest Bitcoin move forward?

Fundamentally, the objective is human liberty. The perpetual ubiquity of decentralized money is necessary in advancing this goal. Individual users must validate their own money for Bitcoin to survive.

But this magnificent opportunity is falling away because it's easier to use centralized services. It's my desire to see developers contributing to the strength of Bitcoin, not inadvertently contributing to its demise. Libbitcoin is our contribution to helping them succeed.",Technical,0.9974
2016/3/3,Bitcoin Classic Hard Fork Likely to Activate at 71% Hashrate Support,"Bitcoin Classic, an attempt to implement an alternative version of the Bitcoin protocol with a higher block size limit, has been one of the biggest stories in the blockchain space over the past few months, and one of the key areas of debate over this new software client has to do with the 75 percent network hashrate activation threshold for a potential hard fork.

Many contributors to Bitcoin Core think the 75 percent number chosen by the Bitcoin Classic team is too low, but the reality is that the hard fork is likely to activate at a level of support more than three percentage points lower.

Bitcoin XT Background

Neighborhood Pool Watch is a popular Bitcoin mining blog operated by blockchain researcher Andrew Geyl. In August, Geyl made a post regarding some potential flaws in BIP 101, which was the block size increase proposal implemented by Bitcoin XT. One of the flaws pointed out by Geyl was that there was no expiration date on voting for Bitcoin XT in coinbase transactions. This means, theoretically, voting could continue forever.

In both Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic, the real method of hard fork activation is a count of miner votes from the last 1,000 blocks. If 750 of the last 1,000 blocks are found by miners who support the new, alternative protocol, then the hard fork is activated (although it doesn’t actually take place until after a grace period). The problem here -- at least in terms of gauging miner support -- is that miners can get lucky and find more blocks than their actual share of the network would predict over the short term.

As an example of this issue in his post from August, Geyl noted:

“After a couple of years (if voting continued for so long) it's conceivable that a true proportion of just over two-thirds could activate BIP 101.”

Real Activation Threshold for Bitcoin Classic

The good news is that Bitcoin Classic has introduced an expiration date for its hard fork plans. If the hard fork to a 2-megabyte block size limit is not activated by January 1, 2018, then it is deemed a failure.

Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Andrew Geyl to get his thoughts on the probability of a hard fork activation below Classic’s intended 75 percent threshold, and he stated:

“I estimate at most a 27 percent chance of activating with a true proportion of 70 percent of the network, but only after 100,000 blocks at that proportion, which would mean remaining at 70 percent for about two years. More realistically, the ‘yes’ voter proportion could stall for a few months, say 10,000 to 20,000 blocks, and in this case there's a 3 to 6 percent change of activating at 70 percent.”

Geyl also shared his thoughts on the level of support required for a hard fork to become likely:

“I think a true proportion of ‘yes’ voters at 70.5 percent to 71 percent of the network could activate Bitcoin classic early with 50 percent probability.”

It’s important to note the January 1, 2018 deadline isn’t exactly set in stone. One has to wonder if supporters of the increased block size limit would simply roll over and give up if the 75 percent threshold is not met by that point in time. Although the relative abandonment of the Bitcoin XT project could indicate that these sorts of miner votes die out if real support is not gathered in a timely manner.

A hard fork by Bitcoin Core has also become more likely over the past few weeks.

What Is an Acceptable Threshold?

Tangentially related to this issue of true hard fork activation thresholds is the issue of at what level of consensus or support from miners a hard fork should be activated. Bitcoin Core is sticking with the 95 percent threshold that has been used in the past, while others are convinced a 75 percent (or even 51 percent) threshold is fair game.

There are tradeoffs with any selected threshold. Ninety-five percent support requires near-universal consensus on a change, so development is likely to be slower. Seventy-five percent support would allow changes to Bitcoin’s consensus rules to happen much more rapidly, but it also opens the door to changes that aren’t universally agreed upon as good ideas.

The differing opinions on the required levels of support from the network hashrate to activate a hard fork are a great example of how the so-called block size debate is about much more than the block size limit.",Technical,0.3182
2016/3/3,"Bitcoin Miners and Core Developers Release SegWit, Hard Fork Agreement","At an industry roundtable in Hong Kong on February 21, representatives of the Bitcoin mining industry and a group of Bitcoin Core developers met to discuss a solution to the Bitcoin block size scaling issue. After meeting for more than 18 hours, they released a statement with agreement on several points about the debate.

Among the group releasing the statement were the founding team of AntPool, A-XBT, BitFury, Bitmain,  BTCC, F2Pool, Genesis Mining and GHash.io. These mining executives represent more than 80 percent of total blocks mined in recent months, according to Blockchain.info. Bitcoin Core developers also joining in the group statement were Cory Fields, Johnson Lau, Luke Dashjr, Matt Corallo and Peter Todd.

The group announced that Segregated Witness (SegWit), a proposed change in Bitcoin’s code that changes the way that data from Bitcoin transaction signatures are stored, will continue to be developed and released in the next two months. SegWit has received a positive reaction from members of the Bitcoin community after being presented by Dr. Pieter Wuille, Bitcoin Core developer and one of the founders of Blockstream, at the Scaling Bitcoin conference in Hong Kong three months ago.

In addition, the statement said that “[Core developers] will continue to work with the entire Bitcoin protocol development community to develop, in public, a safe hard-fork based on the improvements in SegWit … as a recommendation to Bitcoin Core within three months after the release of SegWit.”

The statement continues:

“This hard-fork is expected to include features which are currently being discussed within technical communities, including an increase in the non-witness data to be around 2 MB, with the total size no more than 4 MB, and will only be adopted with broad support across the entire Bitcoin community.”

If the rest of the Bitcoin Core team approves the changes and there is strong consensus from the community, it will support the implementation of a hard fork. This will require everyone running a full node to download the new software in order to stay compatible with the network. The statement predicts the hard fork will likely not be activated until July 2017.",Technical,0.4215
2016/3/4,Four Key Disagreements Between Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Core,"Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd was recently interviewed on episode 34 ofThe Bitcoin Game, and the longtime Bitcoin developer and researcher was able to explain some of the key disagreements between how the Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Core teams view the peer-to-peer digital cash system.

While many view the Classic vs. Core controversy as nothing more than a technical debate, the reality is both camps seem to have rather different fundamental plans for the future of Bitcoin. During his recent interview, Todd noted:

“I think you’ve got a group of developers with a very different view of how Bitcoin works and what the goals of the projects are. I think that’s inevitably going to lead to a lot of friction.”

The current climate in the Bitcoin community is extremely contentious, and the differing philosophical views in the Classic and Core camps are at the root of all the controversy. When asked directly about the key differences between Bitcoin Core and Classic’s alternative implementation, Todd was able to provide four specific examples of where the two sides do not see eye-to-eye. 

1. Balancing Decentralization and Efficiency

For most, the crux of the Classic vs. Core debate is decentralization vs. efficiency. The Classic team is more willing to increase the system resource requirements for operating a full node, while the Core team wants to keep the barriers to running a full node as low as possible.

During Todd’s interview, he often used Bitcoin Classic Developer Gavin Andresenas an example of someone who opposes Core’s main viewpoints. Todd stated:

“[Gavin] expects people to go make that tradeoff where, in exchange for having a system that’s cheaper, you have a system that’s more centralized.”

Todd also pointed out that Andresen has claimed early adopters may be upset with what Bitcoin eventually becomes.

It should be noted that many on the Classic side of the debate would say that their view on how Bitcoin should work would actually be better for decentralization over the long term, but this gets into the next area of contention between the two sides.

2. Keeping Bitcoin’s Base Layer Decentralized

Todd’s first two points are closely connected. Todd all but admits that the real debate is more about how decentralization is achieved rather than which side is necessarily in favor of more decentralization.

The longtime Bitcoin researcher explained Bitcoin Core’s side of the argument:

“I think the real difference is that the Bitcoin Core developers--they understand that these tradeoffs are going to happen, at least with current technology--are willing to put the tradeoffs in different places. I would much rather have the tradeoff be that the Bitcoin blockchain layer--the very lowest level--stays highly decentralized. It may get more expensive to use directly, but you counterbalance that by putting the inevitable centralization at a higher level.”

Other supporters of the Bitcoin Core ethos often say they would prefer to build a centralized layer on top of a decentralized base because you cannot build a decentralized layer on top of a centralized layer. In the past, Bitcoin Core Contributor Eric Lombrozo has explained the need for multiple protocol layers for Bitcoin.

While centralized layers for off-chain Bitcoin transactions already exist (think Circle, Coinbase or any Bitcoin exchange), Bitcoin Core hopes less-centralized systems, such as the Lightning Network, can eventually offer an acceptable tradeoff. Nodes on the Lightning Network are trusted more than Bitcoin miners, but they’re unable to steal funds from users. The system essentially extends the Bitcoin blockchain for fast micropayments through the use of smart contracts.

Former Bitcoin XT Developer Mike Hearn and OpenBazaar Developer Chris Pacia both have writtenblog posts about the Lightning Network with skeptical slants. One of the main criticisms from Classic supporters is that the hubs on the Lightning Network will become too centralized and easy targets for governments as a method to censor transactions.

Whether this will become an issue in the real world is an unknown, but Lightning Network developers are working on Tor-style onion routing features for the system. The developers behind this possible extension of the Bitcoin blockchain understand the importance of protecting privacy at all costs.

3. What Is Classic’s Long-Term Plan?

According to Todd, Bitcoin Classic needs to explain how it will scale the Bitcoin blockchain if it does not view the Lightning Network as a potential option.

He noted:

“I’m just not seeing acceptance from the Classic team that there are limits to the system, and we can’t scale up [via a block size limit increase] indefinitely, so what’s your long-term plan?”

After referencing a statement by Gavin Andresen that Bitcoin may need another hard fork roughly 12 months after Bitcoin Classic’s first potential hard fork, Todd added:

“I think Bitcoin Core has been more focused on enabling solutions that fit on top of the Bitcoin layer, so we don’t have to make that hard trade--a hard decision, yet again, in another 12 months.”

In other words, Bitcoin Core sees the need for something like the Lightning Network for Bitcoin to scale, and simple block size limit increases are not going to cut it over the long term. Bitcoin Core sees the Lightning Network (or some other off-chain protocol) as the best path forward because it does not believe the system can scale with too many transactions on the blockchain. A key side debate here between the two camps is whether the Bitcoin blockchain should be viewed as a settlement layer.

4. Accepting the Realities of Bitcoin Scalability

The vast majority of Bitcoin Core developers and contributors view Bitcoin as a settlement layer because they accept the fact that the system in its current form cannot scale to mainstream levels of adoption. Todd explained what he seemed to view as this harsh reality during the interview:

“The system doesn’t scale, and you just have to accept that and do something smarter. Every time you do a [block size limit] increase, you’re making the system more centralized.”

These two projects simply have two completely different viewpoints on how Bitcoin should work, which means it should be no surprise that the entire community is somewhat split at the moment.

Todd added:

“It’s not necessarily one’s right and one’s wrong, but [Gavin] is not interested in designing the same system I’m interested in designing.”",Technical,-0.4215
2016/3/15," BTCC's Samson Mow on Block Size: The Bitcoin Community Must See Through Manipulation, Keep Calm and Write Code","Samson Mow is the Chief Operating Officer of Chinese Bitcoin exchange, wallet service and mining pool BTCC. A successful executive in the video game industry, Mow joined the Bitcoin company run by his friend and CEO Bobby Lee as an adviser last year, and has gotten further involved with the company ever since.

Mow has actively engaged himself in the block size dispute over the past months. He played a key role in realizing both the Bitcoin Roundtable letter, as well as the Hong Kong Roundtable Consensus.

But his real claim to fame in the Bitcoin space might actually have been a series of tweetstorms – lauded by some, dismissed as unprofessional by others. Bitcoin Magazine interviewed Mow on, among other things, his newly heightened media profile and his perspective on the block size dispute.

Samson, until recently you were a somewhat calm executive not many people in Bitcoin had heard of. If nothing else, your Twitter escapades have hurled you into the center of attention. What's gotten into you?

On Twitter I'm mostly satirizing the situation. It's become too ridiculous. Everything gets turned into a conspiracy theory and people are quick to dismiss anything that doesn't align with their views. Between all of the misinformation and claims without any factual basis, we have passive aggressive attacks on the Bitcoin Core development team as well. There's not much else you can do aside from laughing at the situation.

You used to be quite critical of the Bitcoin Core development team yourself. Last time we spoke you even said that stakeholders might implement a block size limit increase if Bitcoin Core reached no consensus.

The key message was that something needed to happen. The community was frustrated, and I was frustrated as well.

That interview actually lead to a three-hour call with Blockstream president Adam Back, where I gave Adam a lot of criticism about Core in general, but mainly about how they were not communicating well enough. He was receptive to my feedback, as were Core developers, and they have indeed improved their communication significantly since.

I also managed to get a better understanding of how the Core developers actually work together, and came to the conclusion that a lot of the frustration was misplaced. I learned that I couldn't actually complain to just Adam and expect things to be magically resolved. Core is a very diverse group of individual volunteers as well as companies that donate the time from their employees. There are also a lot of differing opinions within the group. They can't simply react to people's feedback – there's no mechanism. It's just a bunch of guys that want to write code and solve problems pertaining to Bitcoin. There's no one in charge.

Wladimir van der Laan is in charge.

Wladimir merges code, as he is the maintainer, but he doesn't make decisions on anything without the group’s rough consensus. That's actually something people have criticized him on – that he is too cautious, and things are not getting anywhere because he doesn't take a decision on matters.

Well, he is the one who decides when rough consensus is reached.

I don't think he is the judge. He is a facilitator. If he would merge code without consensus, there wouldn’t be many developers left in the project.

Now we're stuck at an artificial 1-megabyte block size limit. But in December weren’t you in favor of a short-term bump yourself?

Satoshi Nakamoto set the block size limit at 1 megabyte to prevent spam. But the block size limit has another function; it maintains a low bar for anyone to run a full node, which serves to promote decentralization. Last time I checked, an important property of Bitcoin is that it is decentralized.

My initial preference was to do a hard fork first, but since then I've learned a lot more about Segregated Witness and why it needs to come first: to prevent certain attacks. If we don't focus on these weaknesses, we may end up seeing more problems, like manufactured transactions that destabilize the network.

The Core developers want to both maintain network security as well as decentralization, so naturally they are cautious to increase the block size set by Satoshi. They are also actually increasing the effective block size with Segregated Witness. And as part of the Hong Kong Roundtable Consensus, some have already committed to a hard fork for another increase. I'm not sure how you can call that artificially restraining the block size.

Some say the limit is being kept in place by a small group of developers.

Well, if you define “small group” as the Core development team, which is about 80 contributors, then technically you could say they are keeping the block size limit in place.

However, they can only keep it in place as long as there is consensus to do so – and there is, because it benefits the entire Bitcoin ecosystem. If the Core developers just decided to raise the block size limit to 8 megabytes today, miners would block that unanimously because it would be a massive detriment to mining.

Now, if you changed your question slightly, you could state “the 21 million coin limit is being kept in place by a small group of developers.” If you look at the question from that perspective, then you'll see that the Core team is not keeping anything in place. It's ridiculous to think they alone could enforce the 21 million coin limit – it's the ecosystem enforcing the limit.

You were referring to the Hong Kong Roundtable Agreement. How did that come about?

It started with the Bitcoin Roundtable that BitFury organized at the North-American Bitcoin Conference, followed with a series of calls discussing the issues amongst many stakeholders, and after that, the publication of the ""A Call for Consensus"" letter. We then heard from Pindar Wong – a Scaling Bitcoin Workshop organizer – who offered us some space for meetings. Kang Xie, an active member from the Bitcoin community, played a very important role in setting the stage.

The meeting itself was very ad hoc. Many people, including myself, only confirmed that we would attend a few days prior – or on even shorter notice. We just decided to meet and discuss the issues, with the hope that we could avoid a contentious hard fork. The fact that we were able to come to an agreement and produce a letter, well, that's actually really amazing.

No one from the Bitcoin Classic team attended. Was that your intention?

Our goal was to keep this a very small meeting with a razor sharp focus: figure out what it would take to have a hard fork from the Core team and avoid a network split. We wanted to cap it at 20 people but ended up with around 24.

We didn't want to bring non-developers or people who would not contribute to the discussion in a meaningful way. After some discussion we did extend invitations to Bitcoin Classic developers Gavin Andresen, Jeff Garzik and Jonathan Toomim.

But only on very short notice ....

Sure, but this was not a conference. As I said, it was an ad hoc meeting. A lot of people decided at the last minute to attend. The Bitcoin Classic developers did not. I believe some of them attended the Financial Crypto conference in Barbados instead.

It must not have been easy to come to consensus in Hong Kong?

It wasn’t easy at all. The single biggest issue that kept popping up was the actual increase of the block size limit. That's why we settled on “around 2 MB” for the purpose of finishing the letter. If we settled on a base block size of 2 megabytes, the effective size with Segregated Witness would be 3.6, and possibly 8 under adversarial conditions. But we won't really know the exact size without more discussions between developers and the mining community. If miners and pools are OK with 2 megabytes, that will be fine, but it could end up being slightly smaller.

People with a simplistic understanding of Bitcoin want a block size that's easy to understand, like 2. But it's just not that simple. We've long passed the point where the block size can just be [an] arbitrary number – that was during the time of Satoshi. We're now at the point where block size should be determined by technical and network constraints.

Moreover, people need to stop focusing on the actual block size and start concerning themselves with the number of transactions per block, which is what really matters.

Not everyone seems very happy about the outcome, though. At least two pool operators – F2Pool's Wang Chun and AntPool's Jihan Wu – indicated they want their hashers to vote?

Everyone is a bit frustrated, but there is no problem with them offering their users a chance to vote. F2Pool is technically not running Bitcoin Classic. Maybe there was a bit of misunderstanding there ... or a bit of a loophole in the agreement. We agreed to give Core more time. I have faith that everyone will keep their word and stick to the commitments made in the letter.

The Bitcoin Core developers present at the Roundtable signed on their own behalf, not on behalf of Bitcoin Core. What if there's no consensus among Core developers by the time the hard fork should roll out?

Yes, they committed as individuals. As mentioned before, Bitcoin Core is not a monolith – it's not a company. The Core contributors present could not speak on behalf of other contributors any more than we could speak on behalf of KnCMiner, who did not attend.

It was actually Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd who led the charge on committing as individuals. He made a bold move and said he would commit to the dates as part of the agreement. He and AntPool's Jihan Wu both made a huge effort to bring people together toward the end of the meeting.

As for consensus among the Core development team ... we're giving them time to decide amongst themselves. Ultimately, it is really up to them as to what happens next. We have high hopes they will agree with the opinions of the contributors that signed, and some – like Wladimir - signaled that they do support the agreement. What's ultimately going to end the debate is code being written.

While an important achievement, the Hong Kong Roundtable was only among a relatively small group of people. What about the rest of the community? What about other companies and miners, not to mention users?

The Roundtable group is doing everything we can to bring together more of the industry players, but it's an uphill battle.

For users, we need a method to signal what they actually want. This was discussed as part of a hard fork plan – maybe some way to let users vote with their bitcoins. There’s nothing concrete yet. 

Ultimately, it's not a given that the rest of the community will support the Hong Kong agreement. If it were a given, then Bitcoin would be easy to change, and no longer unique or special. 

At least a part of the community is already disagreeing. They think Segregated Witness won't be ready in time, and the hard fork will be too little, too late.

It's never too late. The important thing is that the community needs to understand it’s being manipulated.

By whom?

The Bitcoin Classic team and their supporters. It's a play for control and influence. Potentially over Bitcoin itself.

They’ve turned a seemingly innocuous issue, the block size debate, into a vehicle to compromise consensus rules. That’s a very slippery slope and dangerous precedent.

They’ve listed supporters on their website who had no idea they were listed, or companies who said they supported a 2 megabyte increase, not that they supported a hard fork by Classic.

We've also been seeing a huge spam attack on the network at the same time these people were screaming that we are hitting the current block size limit. Either they were in on the attack, or they are oblivious to the fact that there was an attack – both of which don't reflect well on them.

They then direct blame to the Core developers, and present themselves as the saviors of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not easy to fully understand – even some executives of major Bitcoin companies have absolutely no idea how Bitcoin really works. So, if you have these people oversimplifying scaling issues to be just an increase from 1 to 2 megabytes, most of the community will not know any better and just follow along. It’s easier to be outraged than logical.

Blocks were indeed filling up for a couple of days. But who gets to say if something is spam, or legitimate use of the Blockchain?

It's an attack if some person or group is intentionally disrupting normal operations for most people on the network. We're seeing wallets sending coins to themselves over and over, spending unconfirmed transactions repeatedly, sending a high volume of low fee transactions, and constantly requesting large blocks to max out bandwidth.

Sure, you can say that these are not attacks and we should allow everyone to use Bitcoin as they see fit, but let's try a simpler example. If someone loots all the toilet paper from the public toilet, is that a bad thing? Is the solution to double the amount of toilet paper stocked each day?

Putting the attack aside, block space is a limited resource. Increasing the block size to 2 megabytes doesn't solve anything. There will always be ways to spam transactions as long as the attacker is willing to pay. We need smarter ways to filter out non-standard transactions and wallets that are smarter at estimating fees, but fees will always and must be a factor in getting transactions into blocks.

Are you saying it's OK to price people out of transacting on-chain?

If Satoshi intended that everything should be done on-chain forever, there would be no block reward halvings. A better term for the block rewards is “block subsidy.” Everyone pays low fees now because their transactions are subsidized by the block rewards. Since block space is a limited resource, you have to be willing to pay for it – this is the fundamental concept of economics: supply and demand.

If people insist that everything must be on-chain and free, they are welcome to provide that service – they can invest a few million dollars to build a data center, buy mining equipment, and then mine low fee transactions as a public service.

Your company introduced a service called BlockPriority, which guarantees that transactions to and from BTCC are included in the first block BTCC mines. Bitcoin Classic developer Gavin Andresen pointed out that is a symptom of an unhealthy network that is becoming increasingly unreliable and vulnerable to attacks.

BlockPriority does not offer any indications whatsoever about the health of the Bitcoin network.

BlockPriority is, however, indicative of vectors for spam attacks on the network that have yet to be patched, the need for better methods for estimation of fees, and the need for Bitcoin businesses to adopt Segregated Witness which will increase block size.

Ideally we wouldn't try to make everything about block size. But I guess if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

Well, obviously some people do believe that an increased block size limit is the solution Bitcoin needs right now. Bitcoin Classic is offering a concrete alternative. What's wrong with that?

Classic has been marketing their hard fork as consensus, when consensus just wants a hard fork, not their hard fork.

Classic's hard fork is an assault on the network, and it is contentious. There are people that say it doesn't fix the attack vectors that Segregated Witness addresses. There are people who don't have confidence in the team behind the project, as it's been constantly changing in just the few weeks they have been together. There are people who think there's no real solution in Classic and that their roadmap lacks substance. There are people, like myself, who think the 75 percent mining threshold is too low for activation, and that the 28-day grace period is an irresponsibly short time for people to upgrade. And there are Core developers who say they will cease working on Bitcoin if a small vocal minority can co-opt the project by changing consensus rules.

Bitcoin Classic represents a small minority?

Yes. We have the Hong Kong Consensus to show there is broad support for a hard fork done together with the Core team.

Bitcoin Classic has gathered a lot of support as well, though. And Gavin Andresen even led the Bitcoin project for several years... surely you're not questioning his expertise?

I actually do question his expertise post BIP 101 and Bitcoin XT. It would have been a disaster if that was adopted. The proposed exponential growth for block sizes would have probably destroyed the network. In fact, even the initial bump to 8-megabyte blocks would have been too big for the network to handle, but it was marketed to everyone as being a safe solution for scaling.

Gavin played a very important role in Bitcoin’s formative years. However, he stepped away from being the maintainer, and largely has not contributed much since then. There are a lot of new people who are actively working on Bitcoin to address security issues and even more who are coming up with ways to extend it past layer 1.

The way I see it, Gavin took care of Bitcoin while it was an infant, and I think we are all appreciative of that. However, now we have people who are teaching that child physics and chemistry. The codebase has been largely re-written. We're doing a lot more advanced features and will need to do far more to ensure its growth – we cannot only look to past contributors for guidance.

So where do we look for guidance within the mess that this block size dispute has become?

We need to look to the people who are actively contributing, either through writing code, donating time or funding development. We need to look to the people who are focused on solving difficult technical problems. We need to look to the people developing new technologies like the Lightning Network. Most important, we need to look to those who are trying to be collaborative and productive.

I believe cooler heads will prevail. What we have is a very loud, and very vocal minority trying to cause a commotion. As long as the community can see through the manipulation, keep calm and write code, we can move forward.",Technical,-0.9778
2016/3/17,"Bitcoin RBF, Bitcoin Knots and Bitcoin Addrindex: Three Core Forks That Don't Break With Consensus","Bitcoin Core, descendant of the original Bitcoin software launched by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, has always been Bitcoin's reference client. The implementation, formerly known as Bitcoin QT, proposes standards for the Bitcoin protocol itself. But these standards are not binding. Based on open source software, anyone can take the code, modify it as they see fit, and offer the adjusted version to the world.

This was recently  highlighted by the launch of  Bitcoin Classic and  Bitcoin Unlimited, and  Bitcoin XT before that. But these implementations did something that hadn't been attempted before, at least not in serious form. They forked the software such that it could become incompatible with Bitcoin's existing consensus rules, essentially proposing that users switch to a network that is not backwards-compatible. Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin XT are not just software forks, they are  consensus forks.

Forking Bitcoin Core's software itself, however, has been done several times before without raising consensus issues. At least three prominent developers, all of whom contribute to Bitcoin Core, maintain their own forks, adjusted to fit their vision and preferred use cases for Bitcoin. Because none of these break with existing consensus rules, they are fully compatible with the current Bitcoin network.

Bitcoin RBF (by Peter Todd)

“Bitcoin RBF” (it has no official name) is a Bitcoin Core fork maintained by Peter Todd, and was launched in early 2014. It's a straight copy of Bitcoin Core, except for its memory pool (“mempool”) policy: the rules that decide which unconfirmed transactions are accepted and rejected.

Most Bitcoin nodes currently apply a “first seen” mempool policy, which means they reject incoming transactions if they conflict with earlier unconfirmed transactions. And Bitcoin Core recently introduced “opt-in replace-by-fee,” which replaces a transaction with a conflicting transaction that includes a higher fee – but only if the initial transaction was specifically flagged by the sender to allow this. These policies make it harder – but not impossible – to double-spend unconfirmed transactions.

Bitcoin RBF, instead, applies full replace-by-fee, which means it replaces unconfirmed transactions any time a newer – conflicting – transaction pays a higher fee. This allows senders to, among other advantages, get a transaction “un-stuck” if the Bitcoin network is bearing a heavy load. It also allows users to double-spend unconfirmed transactions more easily.

Furthermore, to ensure that unconfirmed double-spends propagate across the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin RBF includes special networking code. This connects Bitcoin RBF to other Bitcoin RBF nodes, in addition to nodes that do not apply replace-by-fee. As such, users who want to broadcast a conflicting unconfirmed transaction really only need to connect to one Bitcoin RBF node; the transaction will find its way over the network from there.

Importantly, however, Bitcoin RBF is not at odds with Bitcoin’s blockchain-based consensus model; mempool and transaction relay policies cannot be.

Todd does not really aim for mainstream adoption of Bitcoin RBF. A small minority of users running the implementation allows conflicting unconfirmed transactions to reach miners (even if these miners don't run Bitcoin RBF.) This already makes it  relatively easy to replace some unconfirmed transactions.

And if miners (or pools) choose to run Bitcoin RBF themselves, full replace-by-fee could even become common policy on the whole network, proportional to the amount of hash power represented by these miners. Major Chinese mining pool F2Pool adopted Bitcoin RBF for a very short period of time last year, but has since switched back to typical mempool policy. Whether any other miners run Bitcoin RBF is unclear.

For more information on replace-by-fee, see: 'The Case for Replace-by-fee (and the Case Against)'.

Bitcoin Knots (by Luke Dashjr)

Bitcoin Knots (until recently known as Bitcoin LJR) is a Bitcoin Core fork maintained by Luke Dashjr, and was launched in 2011. The name is a nod to the biblical passage in which Jesus expels the money changers from the Temple with a whip of knots (Dashjr is Catholic), and also refers to merging code.

Compared to Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Knots offers significantly more mempool and mining configurability to node operators and miners. Node operators and miners should have that configurability, Dashjr believes, because they need to verify, store and transmit transactions and blocks over the Bitcoin network; all of which comes at a cost to them.

With Bitcoin Knots, node operators and miners can enable first-seen, opt-in replace-by-fee, as well as full replace-by-fee mempool policies, plus select a myriad of additional conditions to accept or reject (unconfirmed) transactions. Miners, furthermore, can easily lower the maximum size of blocks they mine, from 1 megabyte downward. They can also change the priority size in blocks reserved for bitcoins that have not been used for a while, and can adjust how many low-fee transactions they are willing to include: two anti-spam measures.

And again, none of this is at odds with Bitcoin’s blockchain-based consensus model.

Lastly, Bitcoin Knots serves as a testbed for Bitcoin Core to some extent. Dashjr often implements software optimizations that are adopted by Bitcoin Core at a later stage. Since having rebranded his implementation as Bitcoin Knots and marketing it towards a wider audience, Dashjr took a slightly more conservative approach, however. He now only includes optimizations that he considers reasonably secure.

Bitcoin Knots has been adopted by a number of miners, including the relatively small mining pool Eligius, which Dashjr launched in 2011, but is currently run by “wizkid057.”

Bitcoin Addrindex (by BtcDrak)

Bitcoin Addrindex is a Bitcoin Core fork maintained by the pseudonymous developer “BtcDrak,” and was launched in late 2014. Bitcoin Addrindex is a straight copy of Bitcoin Core with one added feature: It allows users to look up any Bitcoin address to explore its history, much like a typical block explorer.

Bitcoin Addrindex is especially useful for applications built on top of Bitcoin's blockchain: these don't need to rely on a (centralized) API to fetch blockchain data. Bitcoin Addrindex currently powers  CounterParty and CounterParty block explorer  Blockscan. It could potentially be adopted by a variation of other services, including block explorers, wallets and more.

Bitcoin Addrindex is not really designed for average Bitcoin users, as the added feature has no convenient user interface. Bitcoin Addrindex is specifically intended as a building block for programmers.",Technical,-0.5629
2016/3/24,The Role of Bitcoin Nodes: Do Full Nodes Running in Data Centers Benefit the Bitcoin Network?,"Since its launch, Bitcoin Classic's node count has steadily increased. The latest release of the alternative Bitcoin implementation even topped the charts, with almost 3,000 Bitcoin Classic 0.12 nodes reachable on the network.

But a closer look at these statistics reveal some odd details.

First, IP-data suggests that many Bitcoin Classic nodes might not really be many Bitcoin Classic nodes at all. Instead, a single node could use multiple IP addresses to spoof total node count. This possibility appears more likely in light of the observation that very few Bitcoin Classic nodes seem to be replacing existing Bitcoin Core nodes, indicating that these are new nodes, rather than node operators actually make the switch. 

That said, it is theoretically possible that many new users are simply firing up (and shutting down) Bitcoin Classic nodes in the same geographical area simultaneously.

However, it is certain that a lion’s share of all Bitcoin Classic nodes are hosted in data centers, predominantly by Amazon Web Services and Choopa. That's unsurprising, as dedicated websites offer such services, and this practice is encouraged by Bitcoin Classic supporters. Recent data analysis, moreover, shows that a vast majority of nodes in these data centers are almost certainly paid for by a relatively small group of people.

This raises the question: Is it useful to run full nodes from data centers at all? Does the sharp increase of Bitcoin Classic nodes in any way benefit Bitcoin, Bitcoin Classic or both?

Let’s take a look at why anyone would want to run a full node.

Validation

Perhaps the most important reason to operate a full node is validation.

With a full node, users can check whether transactions are valid according to all of Bitcoin's rules. Using nothing but the open source software, node operators can verify that any bitcoins they receive are legitimately mined, correctly signed and more. This is what makes Bitcoin a trustless solution.

This also makes validation a popular yardstick for decentralization, embodied in the “cost of node-operation.” As it is cheaper to validate, more people can do it, which means Bitcoin’s decentralization is increased.

Plus, if a user can validate with his own full node, there’s a privacy benefit, as there is no need to share address information with any third party.

Technically, however, these arguments hold up only when the node is actually at the physical location of its operator. If a user needs to trust a data center to feed correct information from the node, the solution is theoretically no longer really trustless. Though, admittedly, in practice users always trust hardware and software to a certain extent; trusting a data center might be an acceptible risk for most.

Perhaps more importantly, therefore: Validation really serves a genuine purpose only when used to verify incoming transactions. Many Bitcoin nodes operated from data centers, however, aren't used for transacting at all, and, therefore, don’t provide the benefits concerning validation.

Conclusion: Operating a Bitcoin Classic node from a data center provides questionable validation if it’s used for transacting, and no meaningful validation whatsoever if it’s not.

Consensus

Overlapping with the previous point (but harder to measure), full nodes also influence Bitcoin's networked consensus process.

A full node adds “weight” to the set of rules it applies: Whoever wants to transact with that node (and the operator behind it) will need to adhere to its rules. As more nodes apply the same rules, these rules are “strengthened” through their collective network effect.

This might be the main reason many Bitcoin Classic nodes are coming online. They serve as a type of vote, signaling that users are willing to switch to a 2-megabyte block size limit.

However, insofar the Bitcoin network has anything resembling votes, these are not counted per node. Instead, nodes essentially “vote” through their economic “weight.” As the operator behind a node offers more value to the network – think of important merchants, big buyers, large exchanges and more – their economic weight increases.

This means it makes no difference how many nodes someone runs; whether an important merchant uses one node or one hundred, his total economic weight doesn't change. And, therefore, his influence in Bitcoin’s networked consensus process doesn’t change either.

And again, most nodes operated from data centers probably don't add any economic weight at all. They are not actually used for transacting.

Conclusion: Operating Bitcoin Classic nodes from data centers does not provide any meaningful weight to Bitcoin’s consensus process if it’s not used for transacting. It could add weight if it is used for transacting, but running more than one node per economic entity is pointless for consensus.

Decentralization

Other than cost of node operation, another popular yardstick to measure decentralization is the amount of doors that need to be knocked on to control or shut down Bitcoin.

Since full nodes serve as Bitcoin's backbone, it's beneficial to have many of them online ... but only if they are operated by many different people as well, and preferably in distant georaphical regions.

If more than one node is operated from a single data center, it’s the operator of that data center who has ultimate control over all of them. As such, only one door needs to be knocked on to control all nodes in that data center.

Conclusion: Operating more than one Bitcoin Classic node per data center does not provide any meaningful decentralization.

Relaying

Perhaps the most important task of a full node, from a technical network perspective, is relaying transactions and blocks to other nodes.

Moreover, if many nodes are controlled by few people, or are all at the same physical location, this effectively presents a single point of failure. If these nodes represent a significant chunk of the Bitcoin network, and suddenly disappear offline or start relaying corrupted data, it could even be a temporarily destabilizing factor.

However, there is a scenario in which running nodes from data centers could serve a purpose. If a Bitcoin Classic hard fork happens, but almost no non-Classic nodes switch to accept bigger blocks, the Bitcoin Classic nodes operated in data centers could help relay these blocks to nodes that do accept them. As such, running Bitcoin Classic nodes even before a hard fork occurs, could signal to miners that their potential bigger blocks will be relayed. (That said, miners would presumably be more worried about the split in the network in the first place, rather than relay-potential in case of such a split.)

Conclusion: Operating Bitcoin Classic nodes from data centers does not currently provide any meaningful contribution to Bitcoin’s relay process, and could even pose a small risk. There exists a scenario in which operating Bitcoin Classic nodes from data centers could slightly help Bitcoin Classic, but this advantage seems mostly theoretical.

Bootstrapping

Whenever a new Bitcoin node comes online, it needs to sync with the rest of the network. This requires the node to download (and verify) the complete blockchain, for which it needs to connect to fully synced nodes. Running a node from a data center can help.

In this case, however, many of the new Bitcoin Classic nodes operated from data centers have blockchain pruning enabled. They get rid of all blockchain data older than a couple of days. As such, they are no use to syncing nodes.

The Bitcoin Classic nodes that don’t have blockchain pruning enabled do upload blockchain data to syncing nodes. But that was never really a bottleneck or a problem in need of solving. And if it ever becomes a problem, it will be easy to take care of, indeed by spinning up full nodes from data centers.

Conclusion: Operating Bitcoin Classic nodes from data centers could serve some useful data to syncing nodes, but network health benefits are negligible.​

SPV Hosts

Last, full nodes serve as hosts for Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) clients, such as mobile wallet apps. Since SPV clients don't store the entire blockchain themselves, they connect to full nodes that do, and request the data they need.

However, the Bitcoin nodes including the new Bitcoin Classic nodes that have blockchain pruning enabled are of limited use for SPV nodes, since they might not be able to provide all data requested.

Moreover, hosting SPV clients was never really a bottleneck or a problem in need of solving either. And if it ever becomes a problem, it will be easy to take care of.

Conclusion: Operating Bitcoin Classic nodes  from data centers could serve some useful data to SPV nodes, but network health benefits are negligible.​",Technical,0.4588
2016/3/29,"MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative Receives a Boost With $900,000 Raised for Bitcoin Development Fund","MIT recently announced that it has raised $900,000 for the Bitcoin Developer Fund as a part of its Digital Currency Initiative (DCI). The funds raised would be used to support Bitcoin Core development efforts. 

Core developers Gavin Andresen, Cory Fields and Wladimir van der Laan currently work as a team for the MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative and, according to DCI director Brian Forde, the Bitcoin Developer Fund is intended to give the three Bitcoin coders an academic platform to work on resolving the block-size debate and other similar technical challenges.

""We built out the fund to be able to support people like Wlad [van der Laan], Cory [Fields] and Gavin [Andresen] who have supported bitcoin to continue their work in an academic way,"" Forde told CoinDesk.

The donors to the fund include companies including BitFury, Bitmain, Chain, Circle and Nasdaq and individuals such asJim Breyer, Jim Pallotta, Jeff Tarrant, Reid Hoffman and Fred Wilson.

MIT’s Media Lab created the Digital Currency Initiative in April 2015 after the Bitcoin Foundation reported bankruptcy and announced plans to split up into a promotional body, a development body and an additional standards body specifically geared toward the standardization of the Bitcoin protocol.

MIT’s Media Lab was initially supposed to host a Bitcoin standards body as a part of the Digital Currency initiative, but Forde later announced that MIT’s Media Lab would host neither a development nor a standards body. Instead, it would allow the developers to focus on improving Bitcoin Core.

“The Digital Currency Initiative is not hosting a development NOR a standards body. [Andresen, Van der Laan and Fields] have accepted positions at the Media Lab to continue developing [Bitcoin core] — a community-driven free software project.”  Forde told Cointelegraph last year.

“As I mentioned in my post, we want them to do exactly what they were doing before — write the code that maintains and improves Bitcoin core. We look forward to providing them with a stable platform and the resources needed to allow them to best support the community.”

More recently, Forde reiterated the same stance on a post on Medium and said that they started the Digital Currency Initiative (DCI) at MIT, with the goal to create an environment that enabled diversity of work and thought on cryptocurrencies among students, researchers and open-source developers.

As for the funds, Forde said in the Medium post that the money will be used to cover salaries, travel and overall support of Bitcoin protocol development efforts, including events such as the Scaling Bitcoin workshop series.

He further clarified that the donors would have no influence over the developers since the donations were made in what he calls ""unrestricted gifts.”

“It’s important to note that these donations are made as unrestricted gifts,” Forde said.  

“This means that, while the funds will be limited to support Bitcoin protocol development, the donors do not have any influence over the developers. Lastly, nothing has changed for Cory, Gavin and Wlad  —  the goal of this announcement is to publicly recognize the sponsors and address questions people might have about the fund.”

The DCI itself is funded by sponsors of MIT’s Media Lab and not the fund announced today. All the funds will be disbursed in U.S. dollars, even those received in Bitcoin.",Technical,0.4019
2016/3/30,"Segregated Witness Enters Final Testnet Stage, Includes Lightning Network Support","Bitcoin Core developers Dr. Pieter Wuille, Eric Lombrozo and Johnson Lau launched a fourth – and probably final – iteration of the Segregated Witness testnet today. Perhaps most importantly compared to previous versions, “SegNet 4” includes support for another upcoming Bitcoin protocol improvement, CheckSequenceVerify (CSV). This allows for experimentation with routable bidirectional payment channels, better known as lightning networks.

Segregated Witness is the nifty technical innovation that allows senders of Bitcoin transactions to move cryptographic signatures from typical blocks to separate structures. This is set to improve the Bitcoin protocol in several ways, including a long-awaited fix of transaction malleability. And, very relevant in light of the ongoing scaling debate, Segregated Witness will offer up to 1 megabyte of additional block space, depending on the types of transactions.

Compared to earlier SegNets, SegNet 4 includes CSV support. CSV allows users to make bitcoins unspendable for a period of time, much like CheckLockTimeVerify (CLTV), but with a relative timelock. Whereas CLTV locks bitcoins up until a specific time in the future, CSV locks bitcoins up for a specific amount of time after a CSV transaction is included in a block. This enables more sophisticated smart contracts, as it allows for greater flexibility.

Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Bitcoin Core developer and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo explained that the combination of Segregated Witness and CSV particularly benefits added scaling layers on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.

“SegNet 4 offers a testing environment for routable bidirectional payment channels such as the Lightning Network or Amikopay,” Lombrozo said. “These projects could drastically increase Bitcoin's scalability, and allow for instant secure and cheap payments. With SegNet 4, we're providing a common network on which different projects can collaborate and test their ideas. It is open for anyone, and we're encouraging wallet developers to play around with it.”

Since Segregated Witness offers both effective added block space, and enables improved added layers like the Lightning Network, the innovation represents an important early step in Bitcoin Core's scalability road map. But while the innovation is typically expected to be rolled out within the next month, Lombrozo did temper expectations a bit.

“The original roadmap doesn't include specific dates, but the FAQ page on the Bitcoin Core website notes an April deployment of Segregated Witness,” Lombrozo explained. “We're making a lot of progress, but we have a very rigorous testing and code review process which is necessary to ensure the Bitcoin network continues to operate safely and reliably. We plan to propose a feature-complete pull request in the coming month, but it might take a little longer before Segregated Witness is actually accepted and merged into Bitcoin Core. It’s a top priority, however, and we hope to be able to safely deploy Segregated Witness very soon.”

A main benefit of the current Segregated Witness design is that it can be deployed as a soft fork. Once the code is accepted and merged, only miners will need to upgrade; all other users can change their software if and whenever they want to, with no risk of being thrown off the network. Moreover, a recent improvement to the Bitcoin protocol allows soft forks to be rolled out more easily and faster than before, which should benefit Segregated Witness activation as well.

Lombrozo said:

“We're using BIP9 for activation, which means we can deploy CSV and Segregated Witness in parallel; Segregated Witness won’t have to wait for CSV activation nor vice versa. We will most likely merge CSV into Bitcoin Core in the next couple weeks, as it's been more thoroughly tested and is in the final stages of review. A Segregated Witness pull request will hopefully follow shortly after.”

The proposed Segregated Witness concept for Bitcoin was first introduced by Bitcoin Core developer and Blockstream co-founder Dr. Pieter Wuille at the second Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Hong Kong last December. The idea is widely embraced by Bitcoin's development community – though it has also received some critique since. If a problem is found in SegNet 4, there might be a fifth iteration of the testnet, but the design is not expected to undergo further changes.

2016/4/5,Bitcoin Core Launches 'Sponsorship Programme' to Fund Development and More,"The Bitcoin Core development team launched a “Sponsorship Programme” on Monday that intends to provide an easy access point for the Bitcoin industry to support Bitcoin's long-time reference client with both funding and other types of contributions.

Bitcoin Core developer and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo:

“The entire ecosystem depends on projects like Bitcoin Core, but most companies haven't really had a way of contributing resources for this effectively. We want to offer that, and encourage greater involvement in the development process.”

Funding

The sponsorship program is not the first attempt to fund Bitcoin development. But over the years, it was difficult to provide a consistent stream of income for the most active contributors to the project, as most companies were hesitant to contribute. And donation and crowdfunding-based methods proved insufficient.

Lombrozo explained:

“Funding Bitcoin development has always been a complicated issue. A first attempt to structurally ensure funding for the team, the Bitcoin Foundation, was established in 2012, but ran out of funds last year. Since then, MIT Media Lab's Digital Currency Initiative pays the salaries of three developers: Wladimir van der Laan, Cory Fields and Gavin Andresen. Others – like myself – fund our work through a company we founded ourselves, while a small number of developers are hired by companies. And some volunteer their efforts.”

The sponsorship program is perhaps the most direct way for industry players to help fund the development process yet. Potential sponsors can contact some of the most active developers of the project directly through email, after which arrangements can be set up.

Projects

Along with the announcement of the program, the Bitcoin Core development team published a list of projects that require funding or resources (or both.) These include technical projects to improve the Bitcoin Core software and the Bitcoin protocol in various ways, such as increased privacy features, faster block propagation methods and overall research. 

The page also lists more general tasks, such as website maintenance, public relations and education. Bitcoin companies can propose projects themselves as well.

Lombrozo:

“The current Bitcoin ecosystem has received tremendous amounts of investment at the application level â€’ but this is still very new technology, and we need more investment in infrastructure and basic research and development. We want to encourage the development of a vibrant ecosystem with many different companies working together to build this infrastructure and solve key problems in the tech and other areas.”

Much like the typical non-specific rough consensus-based decision-making process, the main contributors to the implementation, along with the potential sponsor, will decide whether a project can be funded, and how.

As the sponsorship program page on the Bitcoin Core website explains:

“Bitcoin Core will always progress on the path of technical and scientific based research and requirements that are compatible with the goals of the Bitcoin system. [P]rivacy, censorship resistance, decentralization, and voluntaryism are key tenets of Bitcoin. Sponsorships therefore cannot guarantee a particular feature would make it into the Bitcoin Core software and even if included, ultimately Bitcoin users decide what software they run, and what features get adopted.”

And:

“[S]ponsorships will be screened for compatibility in advance, so that if the requisite research and development are done, and if the work it passes peer review, there is every reason to believe it could become part of the Bitcoin Core software.”

All funded projects will be managed by a dedicated project lead developer, who is responsible for coordination of the project, such as allocating the available funds and reporting on the progress. Most of the specifics are to be worked out between the Bitcoin Core development team and the potential sponsor, however.

The current sponsorship program is specifically intended for industry players. Bitcoin Core does not (yet) have any mechanisms in place to accept smaller donations.",Technical,0.9961
2016/4/6,Who Funds Bitcoin Core Development? How the Industry Supports Bitcoin's 'Reference Client',"Funding Bitcoin development seems to have always been problematic.

While the Bitcoin industry collectively has raised more than a billion dollars worth of investment over the past years, development of the Free and Open Source Software the industry largely relies on has always had trouble gathering sufficient funds and manpower for development. Several arrangements to raise funds have been tried over the years – but with varying degrees of success and longevity.

Bitcoin Core, considered by many to be Bitcoin's “reference client,” therefore, announced a “Sponsorship Programme” earlier this week. As the latest effort to raise funds, this program is intended to be an easy access-point for companies and other Bitcoin industry players to support Bitcoin Core developers and projects. Companies that decide to take part in the sponsorship program will join a, so-far, short list of entities that do already help fund Bitcoin Core development.

These are the main sources of funding as it currently stands:

MIT Media Lab's Digital Currency Initiative

Shortly after the effective bankruptcy of the Bitcoin Foundation a year ago, the three Bitcoin Core developers funded by this foundation – lead maintainer Wladimir van der Laan, former lead Gavin Andresen and Cory Fields – were hired by the then newly established MIT Media Lab's Digital Currency Initiative.

The MIT Media Lab is an interdisciplinary research laboratory headed by tech-veteran Joi Ito, while its Digital Currency Initiative is headed by former White House adviser Brian Forde. According to Forde, the Digital Currency Initiative intends to provide a neutral academic working environment for the developers.

All three developers on Digital Currency Initiative's payroll are said to enjoy almost complete freedom; they are even allowed to work on alternative Bitcoin implementations if they wish. (Andresen works for no single implementation in particular, and mostly switched his efforts to Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic over the past year.)

Neither MIT nor the Media Lab or its Digital Currency Initiative put up the money to fund the developers themselves, however. Instead, the Digital Currency Initiative relies on “unrestricted gifts” from sponsors, including mining specialists BitFury and Bitmain, wallet service Circle, API-provider Chain, the Nasdaq stock exchange, venture capitalist Fred Wilson, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and others.

Blockstream

Blockstream was founded in 2014 by Bitcoin Core developers Gregory Maxwell, Dr. Pieter Wuille, Matt Corallo, Jorge Timón and Mark Friedenbach, as well as several non-Bitcoin Core developers including hashcash inventor Dr. Adam Back and venture capitalist Austin Hill. Since its launch, the Montreal-headquartered company also hired developers Gregory Sanders, Patrick Strateman and Glenn Willen to work on Bitcoin Core. Another Bitcoin Core developer, Luke Dashjr, works for Blockstream as a contractor.

Blockstream's main mission is the realization of sidechain technology, which the company has done with Elements and Liquid so far. 

Blockstream developers typically work toward this goal, which they say generally aligns with their own long-term vision for Bitcoin. But developers on Blockstream's payroll – who typically co-own the company as well – are also encouraged to work on Bitcoin Core development in a more general sense. 

According to Blockstream president Back, this is because “the company has an interest to see Bitcoin maintained, developed and scale.” Some of Blockstream's developers, like Wuille, work on Bitcoin Core-specific development almost exclusively.

As part of their contracts, all Blockstream developers also have time-locked bitcoins to ensure they are incentivized to work toward Bitcoin's success. These contracts also include so-called “morality clauses”: If Blockstream asks any of them to work against what they consider to be in Bitcoin's best interest, they can refuse to do so while still guaranteed a salary.

Since its conception, Blockstream has grown to be one of the top-funded Bitcoin companies in the space, with total investments adding up to $76 million from various (institutional) investors including Horizons Ventures, AXA Strategic Ventures, Digital Garage and, again, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.

Chaincode Labs Inc.

Chaincode Labs Inc. is a New York-based cryptocurrency research and development company founded by Alex Morcos and Suhas Daftuar in 2014. While the two founders were not Bitcoin Core developers at that time, they set-out to research Bitcoin by getting involved with development, and have done so ever since.

The company is also self-funded by Morcos and Daftuar, meaning they essentially pay for their own development for Bitcoin Core through their company. This means that Morcos and Daftuar enjoy complete freedom to work on whichever project they like, and however they like.

Ciphrex

Ciphrex was founded in 2014 by Bitcoin Core developer Eric Lombrozo and his father Enrique Lombrozo. The San Diego-based software company is best known for mSIGNA, an enterprise-level secure Bitcoin wallet, and CoinSocket, an application development platform.

According to Lombrozo, he contributes to Bitcoin Core because he believes in the future of this technology, and considers working with the world's top experts in the field a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Plus: “Someone needs to do it.”

Since Lombrozo is both the Ciphrex's CEO and a Bitcoin Core developer, he can contribute to Bitcoin's reference client in whichever way he believes is most useful.

Ciphrex raised $500,000 through a Series A stock offering last year.

BTCC

Founded in 2011, Shanghai-based Bitcoin exchange, mining pool and wallet service BTCC is one of the oldest and largest Bitcoin companies in the world.

To support the Bitcoin ecosystem, BTCC recently hired Peter Todd to work on Bitcoin Core for a minimum of 14 hours a month. Todd is free to work on whichever Bitcoin Core-related projects he wants, “no strings attached,” on the one condition that he provides a weekly report on his development efforts. The arrangement will last for at least six months.

BTCC raised $5 million in a Series A led by institutional investors Lightspeed China Partners and Lightspeed Venture Partners in 2013.

Other

The entities listed above are the most clear examples of companies and other Bitcoin industry players funding Bitcoin development. But it should be noted that this list is not conclusive, especially because there is significant gray area.

Some companies (such as Bitware Co. and BitPay) fund development of alternative Bitcoin implementations, of which the code can potentially be forked and included in Bitcoin Core. Other companies (including Lightning, Blockchain and, again, Blockstream) fund development of lightning networks, which is technically not Bitcoin Core, but is closely intertwined as it works toward the same vision and mission for Bitcoin. 

Developers working for yet other companies (including 21 Inc. and LedgerX) provide somewhat informal support through documentation or other help. And, as mentioned, this list is not conclusive.

And, of course, the “Sponsorship Programme” might add new names to the list soon.",Technical,0.3612
2016/4/7,Replacing Bitcoin Transactions: Community Responses to Opt-In Replace-By-Fee,"A new addition to Bitcoin Core called Opt-In Replace-by-Fee allows transactions to be flagged as replaceable, and actually replaced, until the transaction gets confirmed in the next block. 

Opt-In RBF is a change to the memory pool and network relay code and gives wallets the option to add a signal to transactions that gives permission for full nodes to update the particular transaction. Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto introduced transaction replacement in his initial release of the Bitcoin Software, but removed it due to denial of service problems, which opt-in RBF solves by adding a higher fee for transaction replacement. 

It is a slight variation of Replace-by-Fee, another feature included in Bitcoin Core. A full analysis of RBF, written by Aaron Van Wirdum can be found here.

Peter Todd, a Bitcoin Core developer who worked on the opt-in RBF project, publicly expressed concern in a blog post that opt-in RBF wallets are not yet ready to implement detection software for opt-in RBF transactions. He wrote that wallets without this software implemented leave users at a greater risk of being cheated by double-spenders, especially for zero-confirmation transaction (zero-confs). This can lead people to believe that the community should wait to integrate opt-in RBF. 

Todd also admits that this is only a valid concern if merchants and consumer wallets were able to warn users of potential double-spend attempts before the integration of opt-in RBF. If wallets are currently unable to properly detect and warn their users, scammers would have no need to use opt-in RBF, as they would have no problem using the existing system.

Todd actually tested the current level of security of popular user wallets against double-spends attacks and posted his findings in a list, as seen below.

Wallets not only failed to warn users that a double-spend might happen, the majority even failed to warn their users that a double-spend has happened.
Half the wallets tested could be double-spent by an attacker with nearly zero technical sophistication with 100 percent probability of success.
The other half could be double-spent with about 25 percent success rates, again by an attacker with nearly zero technical sophistication.
This means that opt-in RBF will not raise users’ vulnerability to double-spends, as people are already vulnerable with most wallet service providers in the current system until the transaction has been confirmed in the blockchain.

On the other hand, executives of merchant services platforms such as Stephen Pair from BitPay and Jamie Robinson from AcceptBT have been quick to integrate RBF detection software as part as their strategy to mitigate zero-conf risk. 

Stephen Pair wrote in a blog post that Bitpay was “thrilled when we saw that Opt-In RBF was merged.” He explained that “both the ‘first seen’ and ‘RBF’ behaviors are useful and valuable features of the mesh network. The ‘first seen’ behavior is not being dropped and existing wallets and infrastructure that make use of the ‘first seen’ behavior will not be affected (except for minor changes needed to detect RBF transactions). This new functionality makes Bitcoin itself more valuable.”

Robinson told Bitcoin Magazine that he simply changed the user interface of AcceptBT to account for the possibility of opt-in RBF. Now, if a transaction has a possible double spend a message displays to notify the merchant that this transaction is not eligible for instant approval, and a pending transaction shows up in their merchant terminal.",Technical,0.1793
2016/4/7,Bitcoin Hard Forks May Become Safer With User Voting,"Up to this point, the main way to judge support for a change to Bitcoin’s consensus rules has been miner voting. Miners are able to broadcast support for changes to the Bitcoin protocol via coinbase transactions, and these messages of support are tabulated in an effort to judge the level of support among those who are theoretically incentivized to support the network.

On a recent episode of The Crypto Show, Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd discussed the idea of allowing users to vote (or signal support) for hard forks, which is a concept that was heavily discussed at the Satoshi Roundtable in late February. During the interview, Todd summarized why having users vote for changes to Bitcoin’s consensus rules would be an improvement over miner voting:

“Something like coin voting ‒ that could give you much better feedback on what people actually want. Right now, we don’t really have a good way of getting feedback.”

This improved feedback would make hard forks safer because it would give a clearer indication of the level of support for the fork before it is activated. A hard fork without near universal support from users has the potential to create two competing Bitcoin blockchains. Although miner voting is currently available, those votes don’t indicate whether the economic majority will also go along with changes agreed upon by the mining community.

How Can Bitcoin Users Vote for Hard Forks?

Todd noted that this is especially useful during hard forks. Todd explained the basics of how this voting would work:

“As part of the hard fork to increase the block size, part of the conditions for actually triggering this hard fork (in the code to actually say this software is now active) would be that you go vote with your bitcoins.”

Todd also noted that Bitcoin transactions are really nothing more than cryptographically signed messages broadcast on the network. These messages essentially tell the rest of the network to transfer ownership of a certain amount of bitcoins from one address to another. Todd explained that other vote-related messages could also be sent out to the network:

“What we talk about when we say voting is to say, as part of that message, you could either say on top of that, ‘This transaction that gives those bitcoins to someone else ‒ I also happen to support this change.’ Treat that as a vote for the change, or you could go and vote entirely separately, which isn’t even in a transaction.”

How Would This Work in Practice?

Todd explained that the simplest implementation of user voting would likely be a flag in Bitcoin wallets that asks users whether they support a potential change to Bitcoin’s consensus rules. In this way, users would have the option to vote every time they use Bitcoin to send value over the Internet.

Exactly how the voting would work is still up for debate. Some believe that each user should be able to flag their transactions with a vote on every transaction, while others believe this would be something better handled by wallet developers. This part of the discussion gets into the debate over whether Bitcoin should operate as a democracy or a technocracy. Todd indicated that he leaned toward allowing users to handle their own votes, but he added, “It’s not a technical question; it’s a political question.”

Using Bitcoin Days Destroyed

Of course, some issues could arise by simply allowing users to vote on changes to Bitcoin’s consensus rules with their bitcoins. For example, one user could vote many times by simply exchanging the same small amount of bitcoins between his or her own addresses. Todd compared this type of voting to counting votes in an election based on how many times people were able to visit the polls on Election Day. He added, “You want something that’s more like one bitcoin equals one vote.”

To ensure that vote tallies are an accurate depiction of what the overall community believes, it would make sense to use Bitcoin Days Destroyed. This metric multiplies the value of a Bitcoin transaction by the number of days since those bitcoins were last moved. Todd noted:

“That means, essentially, everyone’s vote is counted equally in proportion to how many bitcoins they have and how long they’ve held them.”

Using Bitcoin Days Destroyed for votes would create a system somewhat similar to shareholder voting. Todd explained, “If you hold more bitcoins than I do, you get a bigger proportion of the vote, which makes a lot of sense. You’re more invested in the system.”

Problems With Coin Voting Still Exist

Coin voting is not without its own issues. The key problem with this system for gauging consensus is that it could be difficult to inform the public on how they’re supposed to cast their votes or even that a vote is taking place. Having said that, Todd added that the fact a hard fork would affect everyone on the network could make more people inclined to vote on potential changes to Bitcoin’s consensus rules.

Miner voting is the best option for gauging consensus on protocol changes right now, but coin voting may become an even more powerful indicator of fork support in the not-too-distant future.",Technical,0.34
2016/4/12, Peter Todd Worried About Those Willing to ‘Fork Bitcoin at All Costs’,"Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd recently discussed a variety of topics on The Crypto Show. Todd was asked if he is still worried about the possibly negative implications of a controversial hard fork induced by Bitcoin Classic or any other alternative Bitcoin client. said he is still worried about a hard fork due to some larger block size limit supporters who seem willing to “fork Bitcoin at all costs.”

Some Big Blockers Will Not Back Down

When Todd was first asked how he felt about his hard fork worries, he brought up the fact that some parts of the Bitcoin community seem ready to fork the blockchain no matter what. He stated:

“I would say I’m still very worried because I think we still have a contingent of people in this community whose views are: Let’s fork Bitcoin at all costs, we desperately need this block size increase, and we’re going to need a couple more immediately.”

Todd said this is the general view that he feels Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Blockchain CEO Peter Smith have expressed to him in his conversations. 

“I don’t think these people are going to necessarily back down lightly,” Todd said.

Why a Hard Fork Could End Badly

With the current climate around the debate and the intention of some people to hard fork Bitcoin without near-universal consensus, Todd said there is a small chance this process could go badly. 

“When I say ‘badly’, I essentially mean that we end up with two different economically relevant currencies,” he said. “You end up getting some miners on one coin and some miners on another.”

Factom CEO Paul Snow, who was also present during the conversation on The Crypto Show, disagreed with Todd a bit and said the chances of something going badly were “vanishingly small.” In the past, Bitcoin Classic developer Gavin Andresen has written about his thoughts on the possibility of something going wrong during a hard fork with 75 percent support from Bitcoin miners. Todd has also countered some of Andresen’s arguments.

When pushed further by Snow on why he thinks the chances of something going wrong may be higher than others think, Todd pointed out that some members of the community may be ready to pay Bitcoin miners to run alternative software and force a hard fork. 

Todd said:

“I happen to know that people have been talking to miners and saying, ‘What’s your price?’ What would it take to rent the hashing power needed to force a fork? When you’re talking about scenarios like that, you’re talking about companies with enough money to ‒ at least temporarily ‒ just say, ‘All right. We’re going to support mining. We’re going to make sure this fork can happen from a technical perspective. Yet, those may not be the ingredients for long-term success.”

Todd also pointed to claims from former Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn regarding the use of checkpoints to force a hard fork without majority support from miners. Todd added, “There are a lot of options people have, and the fact that people are considering these options means that the chances of [a hard fork going badly] are not infinitesimally small.”

Todd went on to clarify that the small chance of something going wrong could be quantified as a roughly 5 percent chance, although he mentioned better odds earlier in the interview.

Hard Forks Need to Be Done in the Right Scenarios

One of Todd’s points on a contentious hard fork had to do with the large amount of money raised by some Bitcoin companies, which garnered some laughs from the show’s hosts:

“There are a lot of crazy people in this world, and some of them have a lot of VC funding. It’s not implausible that some of these companies will do crazy things.”

Todd’s final point on the matter was that hard forks need to take place in the right environments. He concluded, “It behooves us to make sure that any hard fork triggers in a scenario where it is very unlikely for any of this to happen . . . Triggering at 75 percent hashing power is not that scenario.”

2016/4/13,"Bitcoins Are Not Tied Up on the Lightning Network, Say Creators Poon and Dryja","The Lightning Network is viewed by many as a serious improvement for Bitcoin in terms of scalability, but there are still plenty of critics of the system who do not believe it is destined for success. During a recent event at the Coinbase offices in San Francisco, Lightning Network co-creators Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja answered some questions about potential weaknesses of this generalized network for payment channels.

One of the key criticisms Dryja and Poon attempted to debunk during the event was that bitcoins are essentially “tied-up” once they enter the Lightning Network. Poon was the first of the duo to respond to this potentially negative aspect of the network. He stated, “It’s not necessarily tied up in the sense that they can [still] spend it.”

Bitcoins on the Lightning Network are Useful

Dryja took Poon’s point to another level by pointing out that, in certain situations, bitcoins on the Lightning Network may actually be more useful than those on the Bitcoin blockchain. Dryja explained:

“It is tied up, as in it’s in this channel, but the thing is, having funds in channels that are on this network might be more useful than having a non-Lightning bitcoin because you can push it anywhere instantly.”

While on-chain transactions require confirmations before they’re considered secure, transactions on the Lightning Network are essentially settled instantly. According to Dryja and Poon, on-chain transactions are also expected to be much more expensive than Lightning transactions once the system goes live.

The belief that funds are tied up on the Lightning Network comes from a misunderstanding of how the system works. In the past, some have wondered whether opening a payment channel with Uber would be useful if you don’t use that particular car service often. This misses the point that the Lightning Network is a generalized platform for payment channels, which means users are able to route payments to practically anyone else on the network.

Dryja used the Uber example to make this point:

“Customer opens a channel with Coinbase and then Coinbase has a channel open with Uber, and so when they want to pay Uber, they just say, ‘Hey, Coinbase. Please forward this to Uber.’ One channel is enough to pay everyone, really.”

A user on the Lightning Network needs only to open up a channel with one other user to gain access to millions of others. However, the vision is that users will have multiple channels open by default to gain access to the entire network.

When Are Your Funds Actually Locked Up?

Although funds aren’t necessarily tied-up all the time on the Lightning Network, there are still instances where things can go wrong (though not completely wrong). 

Poon explained:

“The only situation where there is this structure where it feels locked up is if your channel counterparty is not really online all that much or doesn’t want to route, which is why there is that cost if you want to be a ‘hub’ ‒ because you’re likely to get more of those types of users. It is costly to be that, and that’s why there is that disincentive to operate in that way.”

In other words, if someone who is supposed to be routing payments for you decides they don’t want to do that anymore, they can deny your ability to send transactions on the Lightning Network. This would force you to close the channel, which could lock up your funds for a period of time. As Poon mentioned, there is a disincentive to act this way because you have to make some bitcoins available on the network to be able to route payments in the first place.

How Coinbase Can Help in the Early Days

Poon also talked about how Coinbase can help with user adoption of the Lightning Network in the early days. He noted that funds on the Lightning Network can be used to make on-blockchain transactions ‒ albeit with the help of a third party. 

Poon explained:

“You make the payment inside Lightning. You send it to Coinbase, and then Coinbase makes the on-chain transaction on their behalf. What happens is, at that point, the user is trusting Coinbase to some marginal level.”

Poon added that this sort of functionality would be helpful during the early days of the network when not everyone is already on board. He also stated that Coinbase would be well-suited to act as a bridge between the Lightning Network and the blockchain during this period of time. The only limitation with this setup is that doing extremely low-value “dust” transfers from the Lightning Network to the blockchain would not work.

 

Update: This article has been modified from its original version to clarify that the vision for the Lightning Network is to have each user open multiple channels to gain access to the entire network.

2016/4/15," Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 Released, Major Step Forward for Scalability","Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 was released early this morning and the update includes several changes that have huge implications for Bitcoin scalability. The release deploys the first soft fork on the Bitcoin network to use the methodology outlined in BIP 9 (Version Bits), which allows multiple soft forks to take place at the same time.

The three BIPs (BIP 68, BIP 112 and BIP 113) included in Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 have huge implications for the Lightning Network, which many believe to be Bitcoin’s best chance for long-term scalability. Although the code for the soft fork has been deployed, miners cannot signal their support for it until May 1st.

A Huge Step Forward for the Lightning Network

The three BIPs implemented in this latest release of Bitcoin Core combine to enable relative locktime. This means that payment channels can now be closed without a predetermined date, which would be set when the channel is initially opened. This provides more flexibility to layer-2 initiatives, such as the Lightning Network, because users will be able to exit channels in a more timely manner.

Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Bitcoin Core contributor and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo for further details on how these new changes will affect the flexibility between channels on the Lightning Network, and he said:

“It depends on the locktime duration -- it’s a tradeoff. Too short a time means not enough time to enforce a revocation (and steal back the funds). Too long a time and you risk waiting a while to force the channel to close if the counterparty is unresponsive.”

Lombrozo also added, “I’m not sure we’ve settled on an optimum value.”

According to Lombrozo, the reliability of outsourced revocation, the number of hops between channels, and other variables must also be considered. The Ciphrex CEO added, “Ideally, the locktime is never used. It’s there to prevent broadcast of revoked commitments.”

In a scenario where a user wants to close a channel and the counterparty complies, Lombrozo claims the channel can essentially be closed in the next block.

Block Space More About Users Than Transactions?

One of the key points that Lightning Network co-creator Joseph Poon has made lately (along with co-creator Tadge Dryja) is that his generalized network for payment channels turns the block size limit into an issue of users rather than transactions. This is because bidirectional payment channels with relative locktimes can theoretically stay open forever.

While it’s unclear what percentage of Bitcoin users will want to use the Lightning Network for the vast majority of their transactions, it’s clear to see that this system requires block space for opening and closing channels rather than actual transactions. Although, it should be noted that a user can also send funds in a transaction that is meant to close a channel.

If everyone were using the Lightning Network, the block size limit would be a limit on the number of users who can open channels with other users. Having said that, this scenario is unlikely as there are still reasons to use the underlying Bitcoin blockchain for reasons other than opening or closing a payment channel.

Multiple Soft Forks at the Same Time

The soft fork rolled out in Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 will also not delay the deployment of Segregated Witness because Version Bits was used to implement these new features. Version Bits has implications for the pace at which scalability solutions can be added to Bitcoin, and it also enables a warning system to alert older nodes when new rules are going to be activated. The new rules become active when 95 percent of miners have upgraded to the new version of Bitcoin Core.

2016/4/18,Supporters of 2 MB Bitcoin Blocks Unable to Convince Miners to Hard Fork in Beijing Meeting,"Updated at 6:51pm EST: Bitcoin angel investor Roger Ver contacted Bitcoin Magazine about the Beijing meeting but declined to go into any detail about what took place. However, he told Bitcoin Magazine, ""I think everyone who actually attended the meeting would disagree with what was stated in the article [posted below].""

Bitcoin Classic is the latest attempt to increase Bitcoin’s block size limit via a hard fork initiated by miners running an alternative to Bitcoin Core, but it appears that the relatively new software client may already be on its last legs. According to various sources familiar with a meeting in Beijing on March 30, supporters of an increase to the Bitcoin block size limit were unable to convince the Chinese mining community to implement BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) 109 without support from Bitcoin Core contributors.

Bitcoin Core Supporters Not Invited

It was the intention of some participants to convince the Chinese mining community to adopt BIP 109 without the blessing of Bitcoin Core, which would, with support from 75 percent of the network hashrate, lead to an increase in the block size limit to 2 megabytes via a hard fork. The supporters of an increase in the block size limit also discussed a possible crisis that could ensue if the limit was not raised before the upcoming block reward halving.

Bitfury CIO Alex Petrov and others (who preferred to remain anonymous) have confirmed that anyone perceived to be associated with Bitcoin Core was not invited to the meeting. This includes Bitcoin Core contributors and various supporters of the Bitcoin Core roadmap. For example, Petrov was explicitly told that he was not allowed to enter the venue where the meeting was held until the discussions were over.

This is a similar setup to the meeting that took place in Hong Kong earlier this year between supporters of the Bitcoin Core roadmap and the Chinese mining community, although BTCC COO Samson Mow, who put that meeting together, told Bitcoin Magazine that FinalHash CTO Marshall Long was the only individual who was specifically not wanted at that event. Having said that, Bitcoin Classic supporter Peter Ng did attend the Hong Kong meeting.

Chinese Miners Prefer to Fork with Bitcoin Core

The details of exactly what was said during the meeting are still relatively unknown to outsiders at this point, but sources claim that one end result of the event is clear: Representatives of the Chinese mining community have no intention of deviating from the previous agreement made in Hong Kong as long as Bitcoin Core continues to implement improvements for scaling. Mow, who has spoken with multiple individuals who attended the meeting, told Bitcoin Magazine:

“Basically, [the BIP 109 delegation] came over with an arrogant attitude and tried to dictate who could and could not attend. They were not able to present a convincing argument, and the general vibe is that they’re going nowhere. ‘Train wreck’ would be a suitable term to describe their efforts in Beijing.”

Mow added, “This is based on multiple sources, and my opinion is that it is generally known [among Bitcoin miners and companies in China].”

In addition to Bitcoin industry executives, such as the CEOs of Blockchain and Coinbase, at least one developer attempted to convince miners to increase the block size limit via BIP 109. According to sources, that developer was Gavin Andresen, who authored the improvement proposal.

There are also rumors that miners may have been offered extra money to abandon Bitcoin Core for Bitcoin Classic. According to an anonymous source who was at the meeting, money was discussed, but it was in the context of protecting the network after a hypothetical hard fork had been activated. Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd recently claimed these sorts of discussions have happened in the past. Andresen responded to Todd’s statement on Reddit. He commented:

“That is the way Bitcoin consensus works. Majority hashpower wins, unless they try to force through a change that is rejected by majority economic power (exchanges, merchants, users). The block size limit is a change that the economic majority has been SCREAMING FOR for a long time.”

What Happens Next?

Since the vast majority of hashing power would like to honor the previous Hong Kong agreement and stick with Bitcoin Core, it appears that the only hard fork in Bitcoin’s near future is going to come from Bitcoin Core developers. Bitcoin Core contributors have been able to stick to their December roadmap, and new improvements have been released in a timely manner. At this point, a change to another, hard-fork-inducing software client seems unlikely.

For the supporters of larger blocks, the goal is to get an increase in the block size limit before the upcoming halving in an effort to avoid a possible “doomsday scenario.” Whether this goal will be achieved remains unclear.

Support for Bitcoin Classic stood at roughly 5 percent of the network hashrate at the time this article was published.

2016/4/18,Blockstream’s Johnny Dilley: We’ll Eventually Have an Adaptive Block Size Solution,"The Crypto Show recently interviewed Johnny Dilley, who runs strategy at Blockstream. Dilley shared his views on the future of Bitcoin’s block size limit, and explained why he’s not worried that a solution has yet to be chosen. Dilley’s calm demeanor in regard to the block size issue seems to be partially based on his excitement over various improvements that are making their way to Bitcoin via soft forks.

That a Hard Fork Hasn’t Happened Is Bullish for Bitcoin

When asked about the lack of a hard fork to a larger block size limit up to this point, Dilley said that nothing is likely to change over the short term. He explained:

“I think, today, we’re still no closer to any short-term movement (six months to a year) on the block size issue. That just has to do with the fact that driving consensus in a system that’s designed to not force anyone to do anything is difficult ‒ and that’s actually a good thing.”

Dilley expounded on his view, which has been also been expressed by Bitcoin Core contributor Cory Fields and others, that the difficulties with coming to consensus on changes in Bitcoin is a good thing. The former member of the Pantera Capital team stated:

“The fact that there is considerable tension and the fact that a hard fork hasn’t happened is actually the most-encouraging, most-bullish sign for Bitcoin that there’s been in two years. It means that the system works. The fact that it’s difficult to make controversial changes to Bitcoin is a really good sign. It means it’s very resilient to attempts to overturn outstanding or current governance status.”

Dilley added a disclaimer to his bullish tone, stating, “To be clear, I’m the most bullish Bitcoiner I know.”

No One Entity Has Control Over the Block Size Limit

In terms of what kind of change will eventually be seen in Bitcoin’s block size limit, Dilley said, “We will get to some sort of adaptive block size solution.”

BitPay co-founder and CEO Stephen Pair’s simple, adaptive block size limit is the one flexible solution that has garnered the most attention up to this point; however, many similar proposals have been made over the years.

In terms of how a final decision will be made, Dilley added, “I don’t think any individual or institution really has any control over what that final state looks like.”

Although Bitcoin has not hard forked to a larger block size yet, much of the community, including Dilley, is encouraged by the various improvements, such as CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY and Segregated Witness, that are currently being tested and rolled out onto the network.

Excitement for BIP 9, Also Known as Version Bits

Dilley mentioned a variety of improvements that are coming to Bitcoin, but he seemed most excited about BIP 9 (Version Bits), which was recently used for the first time in the release of Bitcoin Core 0.12.1. This is a change to the way in which soft forks are rolled out, and it will allow many soft forks to be deployed at the same time. 

“That’ll be a massive and strict improvement for Bitcoin’s ability to get multiple things in flight at once,” Dilley said.

In terms of how upgrades have been made in the past, Dilley added, “This sequential methodology that we’ve been working off of has actually slowed our ability to roll out the types and kinds of things that Bitcoin needs to really thrive.”

2016/4/19,Greg Maxwell: Lightning Network Better Than Sidechains for Scaling Bitcoin,"Over the past year or two, the main topic of conversation in the Bitcoin community has been how the system is going to eventually scale to millions or billions of users. Two concepts often brought up during these sorts of discussions are the Lightning Network and sidechains.

Blockstream is in a unique position when it comes to these Bitcoin improvements, as it has the funds and incentives to work on both of these concepts simultaneously. In a recent interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell shared his views on sidechains as a scalability solution and why the Lightning Network will be a better option over the long term.

Implementing Bitcoin Classic as a Sidechain

Some members of the Bitcoin community have wondered whether it would be a good idea to implement changes to Bitcoin’s block size limit via a sidechain. In fact, one of the key points made by Bitcoin Hivemind’s Paul Sztorc in his drivechain proposal was that sidechains would allow Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin XT to be implemented via this technology.

While Maxwell agreed that this sort of functionality is possible, he didn’t seem convinced that it would be of much use. He explained:

“Our greatest motivation for the sidechain concept in Bitcoin was being able to better satisfy mutually exclusive objectives for the system. However, sidechains by themselves do not fundamentally change the scaling limitations of a global broadcast system, though they should provide security partitioning if an experimental chain should fail.”

In other words, splitting sections of the network onto various sidechains does not necessarily mean that Bitcoin can then scale to an infinitely larger number of transactions per second.

The Lightning Network as a Better Option

While many believe sidechains could be Bitcoin’s long-term solution to the scalability issue, Maxwell sees the Lightning Network as a better option. This is the exact opposite opinion recently shared by Bitcoin Core contributor and Bloq CEO Jeff Garzik on a recent episode of Bitcoin Uncensored.

Garzik is a fan of the Lightning Network concept, but he still thinks there are too many unanswered questions associated with it for it to be viewed as Bitcoin’s one, true solution to scaling. It should be noted that Garzik admits these sorts of issues also exist for sidechains.

In terms of a sidechain’s ability to help Bitcoin scale, Maxwell told Bitcoin Magazine, “It may be technically possible to have a low-value, low-assurance and more micropayments-focused sidechain, within limits.”

He then clarified, “However, Lightning, once at release stage, offers a more compelling scaling solution that can really position the Bitcoin ecosystem for large-scale Bitcoin retail use and new, higher-scale micropayments use cases.”

Bitcoin Core contributor and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo discussed some of the micropayments-related use cases of the Lightning Network at Blockchain Agenda San Diego late last year. Some of the use cases mentioned by Lombrozo included: lower-cost paywalls, Joystream (a BitTorrent client that incentivizes seeders with bitcoins), decentralized exchanges and peer-to-peer bandwidth sales.

Many People are Working on the Lightning Network

Much like sidechains, many companies and individuals are working on bringing a useful version of the Lightning Network to Bitcoin. 

Maxwell noted, “At least five companies as well as many individuals are actively developing Lightning, and much of the code and development is open in a similar model to Bitcoin.”

Rusty Russell, who previously worked on the network subsystem for the Linux kernel, is developing an implementation of the Lightning Network at Blockstream, and the original co-creators of the concept, Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja, are also working on their own version of the layer-2 protocol for Bitcoin. Poon recently let it be known that he expects a functional version of his and Dryja’s Lightning Network to be available this summer, while Russell is less certain his implementation will be made available by that time.

Amiko Pay and Stroem are two other projects similar to the Lightning Network that are currently in various stages of development.

2016/4/21,The Segregated Witness Timeline: From Idea to Adoption in Six Steps,"Segregated Witness might be the most significant improvement to the Bitcoin protocol to date. The innovation is set to fix transaction malleability, offers an effective block size increase, enables development flexibility and more. After months of coding, Segregated Witness is getting close to rollout, as a pull request was submitted to Bitcoin Core earlier this week.

How close to roll-out exactly? As with any change to the Bitcoin protocol, that is hard to predict.

A Segregated Witness timeline ...

Step One: The Idea

Each improvement to the Bitcoin protocol starts with an idea.

The Segregated Witness idea goes back a long time; the general concept to separate transaction and signature data probably originated in 2014, or perhaps even sooner. But it was about a year ago, early 2015, that Blockstream’s Bitcoin and sidechain development team decided to implement the concept in their prototype sidechain: Elements. Elements, which includes Segregated Witness, was mostly designed by Bitcoin Core developer and Blockstream co-founder Gregory Maxwell and released in June 2015.

At that point it was still thought impossible to implement Segregated Witness on the Bitcoin blockchain, however, unless it was through a hard fork. Separating transaction and signature data would incompatibly change the structure blocks, which could cause a split in the Bitcoin network between upgraded nodes and non-upgraded nodes.

In the autumn of 2015, it was Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr who figured out how to implement Segregated Witness in the main Bitcoin protocol, after all. Using a clever hack, Segregated Witness transactions can be marked as “anyone-can-spend” transactions for non-upgraded nodes, while upgraded nodes are redirected to an “add-on block” with signature data. This solves the incompatibility issue, meaning Segregated Witness can be rolled out as a soft fork.

This option was first discussed among Bitcoin Core developers through typical communication channels: by private email, on IRC, a little later on the Bitcoin development mailing list and elsewhere. Everyone involved in the conversation agreed it was a good idea.

A couple of weeks later, in December 2015, Segregated Witness was publicly presented by Bitcoin Core developer Pieter Wuille at the Scaling Bitcoin workshop Hong Kong.

Estimated time: 1 year

Step Two: The Code

An idea in itself doesn't change anything. Someone needs to write the code to realize the idea.

Wuille began coding Segregated Witness in November 2015 – a couple of weeks before he presented the idea in Hong Kong. Excited by the potential, Bitcoin Core developer and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo, Bitcoin Core developer Johnson Lau and some other developers started contributing as well.

Five months later, Segregated Witness for Bitcoin Core counts 4,743 lines of code (including test code), and proposes to remove or modify 554 of existing lines of Bitcoin Core code. Wuille and the other contributors consider it done.

Total time: +-5 months

Step Three: The Review

As the code is considered completed, Wuille submitted a pull request this week. A pull request is basically an “official” proposal on development platform GitHub to merge a batch of code – Segregated Witness – into Bitcoin Core's master branch: the continually evolving heart of the project on which new Bitcoin Core releases are based.

This marks the start of the technical review process. Other developers are invited to review and test the code, and offer their opinion. This can be done in the form of a comment, or through a type of vote: “ACKs” (in favor) and “NACKs” (against). There are also several subdivisions of ACKs and NACKs, for instance to indicate that the code has been tested by that developer – or not.

The review process will take as long as the Bitcoin Core repository maintainer – currently Wladimir van der Laan – considers necessary. If he believes rough consensus for a merge is (and will remain) absent, he can close the pull request. The proposal is rejected, and the submitter can opt to re-write the code.

More likely, in the case of Segregated Witness, the review process will provide feedback to Wuille and the other developers, which could lead to slight changes to the code.

And if Van der Laan at some point believes there is rough consensus for a merge, he will merge the pull request. Segregated Witness then becomes part of Bitcoin Core’s master branch.

In the case of Segregated Witness, it's hard to say how long it will take for the pull request to be merged. However, since it is a big change, the process will take several weeks to a month, or perhaps a bit longer.

Estimated time: 2 to 6 weeks

Step Four: The Release

Once the pull request is merged into Bitcoin Core's master branch, it will need to be offered to the public through a new Bitcoin Core release.

Bitcoin Core offers two types of releases: major releases (which typically change the second number in the release version, like 0.10.0, 0.11.0, 0.12.0, etc.) and minor releases (changes the last number, like 0.12.1, 0.12.2, etc.). Major releases are scheduled about twice per year, but usually don’t include any proposed soft forks. This is so anyone can adopt the perks of a new major release, even if they don't want to upgrade to the proposed soft fork. 

Minor releases are offered whenever code for a proposed soft fork (or bug fix) is merged, and Van der Laan believes there is rough consensus for a release. (This is normally discussed during weekly IRC meetings.)

All releases – major and minor – are first tagged as “release candidate.” A release candidate is a proposed release, which is first publicly offered for testing. If any bugs or other problems are found in the release candidate, a new release candidate is created and publicly offered for testing as well. 

Additionally, all releases - major and minor, as well as release candidates - go though a technical building and signing ritual (“gitian building”) conducted by several developers. This is done for security and quility purposes, and can take up to several days.

If after about a week no problems are reported in the latest release candidate, Van der Laan will announce that this release candidate is now the actual new release. This new release is distributed through bitcoincore.org and bitcoin.org.

Estimated time: 1 week+

Step Five: The Activation

Once Bitcoin 0.12.2 is released, the Bitcoin Core development team will encourage everyone to upgrade. While upgrading is optional – older nodes will remain compatible with the rest of the Bitcoin network – upgraded nodes reap the benefits of Segregated Witness and retain maximum security.

But if only typical users upgrade, Segregated Witness will not yet activate. Activation will require miners to upgrade. As per Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 and the adoption of version bits, soft forks happen through a new type of signaling.

First, miners (or pools) running Bitcoin Core 0.12.2 (and Bitcoin implementations that merged similar code), automatically start signalling they are ready to mine Segregated Witness transactions. This happens through version bits they include in blocks they do mine that indicate what types of transactions and blocks they can mine. 

Once miners representing 95 percent of hash power (1,916 blocks) within a single difficulty period (2,016 blocks/about two weeks) include the right version bit, the soft fork is locked in. One difficulty period later, the soft fork is activated, meaning the remaining 5 percent of miners have about two weeks to upgrade. (If they don't upgrade, they will remain part of the Bitcoin network, but could have their blocks orphaned by other miners if they include now-invalid transactions.)

Whether and how fast miners representing at least 95 percent of hash power will support Segregated Witness is hard to predict. As per the Hong Kong Bitcoin Roundtable Consensus letter, a vast majority of miners by hash power pledged to adopt Segregated Witness. 

But even that letter did not represent 95 percent of hash power. And slightly more than 5 percent of hash power is currently mining in favor of Bitcoin Classic; it’s not clear if the competing Bitcoin Core fork will merge Segregated Witness as well. (Nor is it clear if these miners will stick with Bitcoin Classic if it doesn’t merge Segregated Witness.)

Minimum time: 4 weeks

Step Six: The Adoption

After Segregated Witness is activated on the Bitcoin network, one final step is required for users to reap the benefits: Wallet software must include the option to actually create and receive Segregated Witness transactions.

How long it will take for wallets to adopt depends on their developers ‒ and on Bitcoin library developers. When Bitcoin asked wallet and library developers about this earlier this year, it seemed that most do plan to integrate Segregated Witness into their software. The pace at which this will happen might vary, however; some developers are more willing, better funded or simply more capable than others. Some made the necessary changes already and will support Segregated Witness from Day 1 of activation; others might take a bit longer.

But as long as there is at least one wallet offering the option, users can always switch and enjoy the benefits right away.

2016/4/22,This Bitcoin Developer Is Working Hard to Prepare Projects for Segregated Witness,"Nicolas Dorier is the main developer behind NBitcoin, which is a comprehensive Bitcoin library for the .NET framework. NBitcoin is used in the backend of multiple Bitcoin services such as Lykke, BitKong, Teambrella and BTCTrader.

Recently, Dorier has been working on various projects intended to assist developers who wish to implement the upcoming Segregated Witness (SegWit) improvement in their own wallets, exchanges and other Bitcoin-related services. Dorier, who is also a Bitcoin Core contributor, updated his book on Bitcoin programming to show people how to use SegWit in NBitcoin and also released a number of developer tools, such as checktx and checkscript, to help developers better understand how SegWit transactions work.

In addition to his work on these developer resources, Dorier has (perhaps more importantly) implemented SegWit in NBitcoin and bitcoinj. In a recent interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Dorier shared his thoughts on Segregated Witness and how it will affect the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Thoughts on the Adoption of SegWit by Bitcoin Services

Many have said Segregated Witness is a set of complex code that will be difficult for wallets and other Bitcoin services to implement, but Dorier does not see things that way. The NBitcoin developer agrees with Bitcoin Core contributor Eric Lombrozo that it should take less than a week to implement this Bitcoin improvement. Dorier explained:

“Most of the users use abstractions above raw Bitcoin transaction programming with the classes Coin, ScripCoin and TransactionBuilder. Programmers using that don't really have to know how SegWit works, as it is similar to normal P2PKH or P2SH payments.”

To illustrate his point, Dorier noted that Smartbit, an Australian Bitcoin exchange, was able to add support for SegNet (the Segregated Witness test network) in less than an hour. Dorier explained how this was possible:

“The reason is that they only needed to update the NBitcoin libraries, run a new bitcoind, and it worked without them changing any code at all.”

Dorier also shared the following thoughts on how long it will take for all Bitcoin users to start using SegWit transactions:

“As with all technological progress, adoption will follow an S curve. I guess within two years, 90 percent adoption will be reached. We can probably compare that to how much time it took for P2SH to be supported widely, except that this time there is also a financial and technical incentive to do so.”

BitcoinJ and NBitcoin are Ready for SegWit

Dorier implemented SegWit in both NBitcoin and bitcoinj, but the changes are not yet active in bitcoinj. NBitcoin has supported SegWit since January, but bitcoinj maintainer Andreas Schildbach (whose work is now sponsored by Bloq) wants to wait for the code to evolve further. Dorier told Bitcoin Magazine:

“I think this is important for a library to support things ahead of time so people can start playing with it and bring important feedback ‒ feedback which can not only be useful for NBitcoin, but for the SegWit implementation in Bitcoin Core as well.”

Dorier also discussed the importance libraries have in the Bitcoin ecosystem:

“Innovations bubble from Bitcoin Core up to different layers. On top of Bitcoin Core, you get libraries, and on top of libraries you get all Bitcoin services which are ‘end user visible.’

Libraries are the bottleneck for innovation if not properly maintained, as virtually all services depend on them, so it is important to get features in the hands of our users as fast as we can.”

Dorier added that Breadwallet is one of the few exceptions to the rule of services depending on libraries. Breadwallet implemented its own library in Objective-C.

What a Time to Be in Bitcoin

Dorier noted that this is the most exciting year for him in Bitcoin since he joined the community in 2014.

“The wave of innovation that will come out of CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY and SegWit will have long-term implications that are still underrated,” he said.

Lombrozo has outlined multiple use cases of the Lightning Network, which is empowered by these new protocol changes, and Dorier noted how his own company, Metaco, will combine payment hubs with the Open Asset protocol to allow colored coins to be sent for free in an off-chain environment. Dorier added, “The Bitcoin blockchain provides the insurance to the user that they can't get their token confiscated while they are off-chain in a payment channel.”

Dorier recently posted some thoughts about using payment hubs in combination with the Open Asset protocol on the Coinprism blog.

2016/4/28,What Is Gitian Building? How Bitcoin’s Security Processes Became a Model for the Open Source Community,"One of Bitcoin's most important security features, a crucial property that makes the system trustless, is its open source nature. Because Bitcoin’s code is open source, anyone able to read code can check for themselves whether it does what it's supposed to do. 

Plus, as per Linus's Law: Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.

But open source code doesn't necessarily eliminate all risk. Users still need to trust that the software they run on their computers actually reflects the open source code as it should. To eliminate this risk, Bitcoin developers have developed a fierce security policy which goes beyond the open source nature of Bitcoin itself: “Gitian Building.”

Gitian Building is even increasingly embraced by the wider open source community. Development teams behind Tor, Debian, Mozilla and other open source projects are embracing the practice spearheaded by the Bitcoin Core development team, and it might very well become an open source standard before long.

Here's why Gitian Building is important, and how it works.

On Source Code and Binaries

The problem that Gitian Building solves, at its heart, is that humans and computers do not speak the same language.

Bitcoin Core is written in C++, one of several programming languages. Programming languages – while obviously very different from actual languages – can be written and read by humans. And it's this C++ code that's open source, and therefore checkable and verifiable.

But computer CPUs cannot actually read these programming languages. Instead, CPUs have their own “machine language”: binaries. Binaries, as the name suggests, are often represented as “ones” and “zeros.” But more important: binaries are not readable by humans.

For a program written in human readable code (such as C++) to be executed on a computer, it must be “translated” into binaries. This “translation” process is called “compiling,” and is done using special software: a compiler. Someone, somewhere needs to compile code into binaries.

If it weren't for Gitian Building, the compiling process would present a potential single point of failure.

The Risk

So what, exactly, the risk if there is no Gitian Building process?

Let's say that Wladimir van der Laan, Bitcoin Core's lead developer, is tasked with compiling Bitcoin Core's code into binaries. This would mean he’d have to insert C++ code in the compiler installed on his computer, and the Bitcoin Core binaries come out on the other end. He then distributes these binaries through bitcoin.org, bitcoincore.org and perhaps other platforms.

The problem is obvious. While anyone able to read C++ can check and verify Bitcoin Core's open source code, they still need to trust that the binaries as published by Van der Laan reflect this same code.

But if, for example, Van der Laan’s computer is compromised, his compiler could be replaced with software that creates malicious binaries instead ‒ perhaps binaries that look like Bitcoin Core when running on a computer, but that actually steal bitcoins. Or, Van der Laan might be coerced by someone with nefarious intentions, and is forced to publish malicious binaries. Or perhaps Van der Laan will one day go crazy and intentionally spread malware himself.

It's unlikely anyone would realize any of this until it's too late; while the code is open source, no one can actually read the binaries.

Gitian Building

The easy way to solve this problem would be to have several developers all build binaries from the same code and cross check these binaries against each other. If their binaries are identical, they know the binaries are accurate, and none of them would be compromised. Plus, anyone else could compile the binaries, too, and check whether the developers are still acting honestly. This type of cross checking would eliminate a single point of failure. 

Unfortunately, it's not that simple. Binary building is a very unpredictable process, involving many variables. If different developers for instance use different compilers, different operating systems, or even compile the binaries at different times, the binaries might look very different. This makes simple cross checking useless.

To solve this, a Bitcoin ecosystem contributor going by the pseudonym “Dev Random,” along several Bitcoin Core contributors, created Gitian.

Gitian is an open source software program that offers what is known as a “build environment.” A build environment is perhaps best described as a “computer within a computer,” but with a specific purpose: a virtual space to compile binaries, completely free of any variables. “Gitian Building,” the process of compiling binaries in Gitian, ensures that whatever computer is used, the binaries turn out exactly the same. 

This, in turn, enables different developers to reliably cross check their binaries against each other. And, of course, it allows anyone else to verify whether the binaries match the source code as well.

2016/5/3,Seven Questions to Make Sense of Craig Wright's Signature Proofs,"The Australian computer scientist Craig Steven Wright is sending shock waves throughout the Bitcoin world, as he once again claims to be the man who invented Bitcoin.

At the heart of the story, Wright himself published a blog post suggesting he signed a message with one of Satoshi Nakamoto's private keys. And importantly, Wright's claim was backed by Bitcoin-prominents including former lead developer Gavin Andresen and former Bitcoin Foundation director Jon Matonis; both believe to have witnessed Wright sign a message with Satoshi Nakamoto's private key.

Yet, the Bitcoin community remains highly skeptical. The answers to these seven questions explain why.

1. What does it mean to “sign a message”?

The option to sign a message is a feature of public key cryptography, the type of cryptography on which Bitcoin is based.

Public key cryptography makes use of two types of keys: public keys and private keys. Both are really just strings of numbers that correspond through a mathematical formula. But while it is very easy to calculate a public key from a private key, it is practically impossible to calculate a private key from a public key. It's a “one way street.""

A private key can also be combined with any other data using a similar mathematical formula. This data could even be text or images; in that case the data is first hashed (“translated”) into a string of numbers (a “hash,"" or “digest”).

Combining a private key and other data creates a new and unique string of numbers, called a signature. And again, it is easy to calculate a signature from a private key and data, but it is practically impossible to calculate the private key or data from the signature.

And here's where the magic of cryptography kicks in: with only the public key and the data, it's possible to verify whether the signature was created using the corresponding private key. Message signing therefore proves ownership of the specific private key corresponding to a given public key, without needing to reveal that private key.

In Bitcoin's case, signing is typically used to spend bitcoins. The “owner” of a bitcoin signs the hash part of a transaction, as such approving that bitcoins are effectively sent “from” his public key, “to” another public key.

2. What could Wright do to prove he is Satoshi Nakamoto?

That is a tricky question, as the answer differs from one person to the next.

That said, many agree that Wright should at least be able to sign a message using a private key that only Satoshi should posses – which is indeed what Wright and others suggest he has done.

There's really only one private key we know for sure belongs to Satoshi Nakamoto: the private key corresponding to the public key on which the first-ever bitcoins were mined, as embedded in the so-called “Genesis Block."" Additionally, there is anecdotal evidence that the private key used for the first-ever typical Bitcoin transaction belongs to Satoshi Nakamoto as well. It's also likely that Satoshi Nakamoto should posses many other private keys included in early Bitcoin blocks, as well as the private key that corresponds to a well-known public key (which is stored on a key server), but all this is harder to establish with the same level of certainty.

So, to prove he is Satoshi Nakamoto, Wright could sign a message using the private key corresponding to the public key from the Genesis block. Or, maybe, corresponding to the first-ever Bitcoin transaction. (Or he could spend bitcoins associated with these addresses; though of course it might be a bit more tricky to prove it was he who moved the coins, and not someone else.)

If done correctly, anyone should be able to verify the results.

It wouldn't really matter what kind of message Wright signs. Though it would help if the message itself identifies Wright as the creator of Bitcoin as well. And it should preferably be done in a controlled setting, so that only those in the room know which message is signed.

The message could for instance read:

“I, Craig Steven Wright, am Satoshi Nakamoto.”

3. Did Wright publish a signature corresponding to a private key only Satoshi should posses?

Technically: yes! (But not in any meaningful way.)

In his blog post, Wright published a signature that corresponds to both a hash (also published in his blog post), as well as to the private key used to make the first Bitcoin transaction.

So far so good.

But what Wright did not mention - and this seems very deceitful - is which data he used to create the hash he supposedly signed. And as it turns out, Wright did not sign a hash of a Jean Paul Sartre text, as he seemed to suggest in his blog post. Nor did he sign a hash of a message identifying himself as the creator of Bitcoin, as suggested above.

Instead, and without disclosing this information, Wright signed a hash of the first Bitcoin transaction--or rather, he claimed to. 

And remember, signing a transaction hash is how Bitcoin transactions are approved. Plus, of course, the signature itself is part of that transaction as well; it was included by Satoshi Nakamoto to approve of the transaction.

The absurdity of the “evidence” needs repeating.

Wright literally re-published a signature created by Satoshi Nakamoto seven years ago, using nothing but information that is already publicly available in Bitcoin's blockchain.

So while Wright technically published a valid Satoshi Nakamoto signature, that doesn't prove he is Satoshi Nakamoto, any more than publishing a signed Babe Ruth baseball card would have proven he is Babe Ruth.

4. Did Wright create any other signatures corresponding to private keys that only Satoshi should possess?

Andresen, Matonis and several journalists claim that Wright, in their presence, signed additional messages with private keys only Satoshi should possess.

So how did that happen?

According to Andresen, and as reported by Wired, Wright is said to have signed the message: “Gavin’s favorite number is eleven,” combined with Wright's initials, “CSW."" Wright did this on his own computer, and then loaded the signature on a USB-stick provided by Andresen. This signature was transferred to what Andresen believed to be a newly bought, factory-sealed laptop provided by Wright's assistant. On this computer, they installed Electrum's Bitcoin wallet software, which can be used to sign and verify messages.

The signature as provided by Wright was checked against the message and one of Satoshi's public keys. According to the software (and after a failed attempt that didn't include Wright's initials in the message), the signature checked out.

Unfortunately, Andresen says he was not allowed to take the signature data with him; allegedly Wright feared Andresen would leak it. As such, it is impossible to cryptographically verify any part of this story.

As for Matonis's part of the story, as well as for the other journalists, not as many details are known. But so far none of them have delivered any cryptographic evidence either; and it seems unlikely they will.

5. Did Wright trick Andresen, Matonis and others?

Wright almost certainly attempted to trick readers of his blog post; there seems to be no other rational explanation. This has led many to believe he may have also attempted to trick Andresen, Matonis and the journalists, and did so successfully. Speaking to Wired, Andresen himself, too, acknowledged there is the possibility that Wright “bamboozled” him – though he considers it unlikely.

So how could Wright have possibly tricked Andresen, Matonis and the other journalists?

The easiest way to pull this off might have been the use of fake Electrum software. This fake software could, for instance, have been modified to approve any string of numbers as a valid signature. (Or perhaps any string of numbers as long as the inserted message includes Wright's initials – which fits the story.)

While this is definitely a very speculative explanation, Electrum's logs do suggest that no verification data was downloaded on the day Andresen met Wright. This at least suggests Andresen didn't check if the Electrum software was legit.

So how, then, could Wright have managed to install fake Electrum software on a brand new computer, even though he did this together with Andresen?

As Andresen himself suggested, this could have been done by hacking into the hotel wifi, to host a fake Electrum website with the fake software. Or, perhaps slightly easier, a fake hotel wifi (deceptively named “Hotel Wifi”) could have been set up near their room, to pull off a similar trick.

Or, perhaps the new, factory-sealed laptop was not really new or factory-sealed at all, and only made to look that way.

There are probably other tricks possible. But again this is all speculation.

6. Is anyone else backing Wright's story?

Yes.

Shortly after Wright's media storm ignited, two more digital currency veterans spoke out to back Wright's claims: R3 architect Ian Grigg, and New Liberty Dollar issuer Joseph Vaughn Perling.

Going into more detail in a blog post, Grigg claims that Wright was part of a small team behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, which would have also included the late Dave Kleiman. Grigg also notes that the team suffered much distress throughout the past years, suggesting Wright deserves to be left in peace now.

Perling did not provide much more background information, though his tweets echoed a similar sentiment as Grigg's: Wright – who is the man behind Satoshi Nakamoto – experiences much distress, and deserves some privacy.

As opposed to Andresen and Matonis, however, Grigg and Perling do not claim to have seen cryptographic evidence. Nor have they provided any.

7. So... Is Wright Satoshi Nakamoto or not?

All we know is that no cryptographic proof has been provided so far – worse yet, the only “cryptographic proof” Wright has provided so far is provably deceitful.

However, in Wright's latest blog post, he announced he will move some of Satoshi's coins (which is equivalent to signing a message). Unfortunately, the blog post itself was not signed, nor did it include a signature.

So for now, we can only speculate... and wait.

2016/5/3,The Real Story Behind the MIT ChainAnchor Project for Bitcoin,"ChainAnchor is an MIT project that was brought to the attention of the Bitcoin community in late April by Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd. In his blog post, Todd questioned whether this project may have been an attempt to bring Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance to Bitcoin.

MIT Connection Science Managing Director David L. Shrier responded to Todd’s blog post directly on Reddit, saying, “ChainAnchor was never intended for [B]itcoin.”

When first asked about why a preliminary version of the ChainAnchor paper discussed Bitcoin, Shrier pointed Bitcoin Magazine to another Reddit comment where he said, “[ChainAnchor] was never intended to apply to Bitcoin. In the course of seven subsequent drafts, we have sought to clarify this.”

When then asked why there are explicit references to implementing ChainAnchor as an overlay on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, Shrier told Bitcoin Magazine, “In a very early draft of the project, its focus on permissioned blockchains was not well explained, which is why we clarified.”

Shrier went on to point to the current version of the ChainAnchor paper, which is more explicit about its use in permissioned ledgers (as opposed to permissionless blockchains such as Bitcoin) and dated two days prior to Todd’s blog post; however, the preliminary draft provided by Todd on his blog stated:

“In the second deployment mode – called the semipermissioned overlay – ChainAnchor is deployed as an overlay above the current permissionless public blockchain in Bitcoin. The goal of the overlay approach is not to create a separate chain, but rather use the current permissionless blockchain to carry permissioned-transactions relating to Users in ChainAnchor in such a way that non-ChainAnchor nodes are oblivious to the transactions belonging to a permissioned-group.""

Bitcoin Magazine reached out to David Shrier again in regard to this excerpt specifically, and Shirer clarified, “Rigorous research requires exploring ideas, even ones that don't prove out. The ‘semi-permissioned’ idea wasn't a good idea (in my personal opinion), but one that we explored in the interests of rigor. It's not how the system was designed.”

MIT’s ChainAnchor FAQ says the original draft of the paper “made several mentions of Bitcoin in order to provide both comprehensiveness and familiarity to the reader.”

It’s clear that the latest draft of the ChainAnchor paper is about permissioned blockchains and not Bitcoin, but Todd says multiple anonymous sources have told him the intention is to turn Bitcoin into a permissioned payment platform. Todd speculates that his sources are unable to talk due to nondisclosure agreements (NDA), but Shrier told Bitcoin Magazine, “There are no NDAs around ChainAnchor. We have no idea what he's talking about.”

Regardless of the true intentions of those behind MIT’s ChainAnchor project, the preliminary documents illustrate that the semi-permissioned overlay version of ChainAnchor, which is not found in newer versions of the paper, is a possible exploit for those who wish to attack Bitcoin.

Bribing Bitcoin Miners

Although the idea of Bitcoin miners requiring users to identify themselves in order to use the network may seem ludicrous to some, the preliminary ChainAnchor paper outlines how miners could be coerced into this new, permissioned setup: by bribing them. 

The paper stated:

""In the ChainAnchor semi-permissioned overlay a successful miner receives a further additional payment (beyond the new coins and transaction fees in Bitcoin) for completing a block consisting only of permissioned-transactions.""

To many, Bitcoin’s main value proposition is its utility in censorship-resistant transactions on the Bitcoin network, but the incentives for miners to protect this feature may be skewed when an outside party offers a bonus for restricting block space access to an approved list of users.

In his recent post, Todd speculated about ChainAnchor’s purpose:

“What’s likely going on here is ChainAnchor is trying to force people to register with their service by making non-compliant transactions from unregistered users cost more and take longer to be confirmed.”

Non-compliant transactions would take longer to confirm because they can be mined only by miners who are not part of the semi-permissioned overlay system.

Todd also added that one of the main concerns he’s heard from his sources is they do not wish to be involved in a scheme that attempts to take monopoly control over Bitcoin transactions. Again, it should be pointed out that the current version of ChainAnchor does not mention applying the concept to Bitcoin at all.

Regardless of ChainAnchor Intentions, This Attack Is Possible

Regardless of the true intentions of the individuals behind the ChainAnchor concept, it’s important to note that this sort of attack is possible today. Indeed, miners get to pick which transactions they wish to include in the next block. In fact, some miners already block certain types of transactions from their mined blocks.

If a miner is offered enough money, he or she may decide to block transactions that aren’t pre-approved by some sort of regulator. Of course, this setup would harm Bitcoin’s fungibility, which is already rather weak. Once transactions are controlled in this manner, it’s questionable whether Bitcoin would fit the definition of money.

Even if a combination of Confidential Transactions and JoinMarket were implemented in Bitcoin by default, it wouldn’t matter because miners would mine only transactions with real-world identities tied to them. At that point, Bitcoin users would have to search for alternatives (likely through a change in proof of work) that would resist these sorts of advances from bad actors.

When asked whether this attack could work in practice, Todd told Bitcoin Magazine:

“It's hard to predict ‒ exchanges could be forced into this scheme, at which point it'd be easy to get a subset of miners to start mining only permissioned blocks.”

When asked whether a change in proof of work (PoW) could ultimately block this sort of attack, Todd stated:

“Don't assume that's an easy thing to do; changing the PoW would be chaos, and could easily be engineered to be part of a 51 percent attack. When you change the PoW, you have to ask, who is in the best position to mine the new chain? If the new PoW isn't ASIC hard, it's very easy to temporarily rent or steal a large amount of computing power to attack it.”

Todd added, “If it is best mined on ASICs however, it's quite plausible that the new PoW algorithm will be chosen maliciously to match something someone has a big supply of ASICs for, again, a 51 percent attack.”

Although Todd is concerned with the implications of a permissioned overlay built on top of Bitcoin, one of the ChainAnchor paper’s co-authors, MIT Internet Trust Consortium Technical Director Thomas Hardjono, told Bitcoin Magazine:

“Part of how we helped establish the impracticality of ChainAnchor for an overlay on Bitcoin was ... the incentive to focus on compliant transactions. A miner would have to wait for such transactions to show up. Waiting means they lose money doing nothing (while other miners make money doing the usual mining of ordinary transactions.) This also helped reinforce our thinking as to why ChainAnchor was only feasible on permissioned blockchains.""

When asked about Hardjono’s comments, Todd generally agreed, telling Bitcoin Magazine:

“It's really quite simple: Bribing miners happens after you get some initial volume (e.g. driven by exchanges joining the system.) Taken at face value, it's stupid, too, as there's no technical reason for miners to exclusively mine permissioned transactions.”

Is Centralization Bitcoin’s Biggest Weakness?

Although this sort of attack is likely possible even with a much more decentralized group of Bitcoin miners, this sort of coercion is much easier when there are only a handful of people who have to be convinced to bring permissioned-access to Bitcoin’s supposedly permissionless network.

Todd has discussed the issues related to the centralization of Bitcoin mining quite often in the past, and in his post about ChainAnchor, he wrote:

“What’s interesting about this threat is the attacker is trying to change the composition of the mining community itself from less to more regulated, using profitability as a weapon. As defenders ‒ and protocol designers ‒ we have to figure out what kind(s) of miner we’re trying to encourage to achieve our goals, and how to ensure the economic incentives of the system keep those miners profitable.”

Ironically, Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra recently warned about the threat that centralization of mining is to Bitcoin’s censorship resistance at the 2016 MIT Bitcoin Expo.

A solution to Bitcoin’s mining centralization problem is not entirely clear, but some members of the community, such as 21, believe the mining process will eventually become massively distributed and decentralized once again.

There has been speculation as to whether Bitcoin Foundation Chief Scientist Gavin Andresen may be involved with this project. Andresen responded to this claim directly in a recent Reddit Ask Me Anything (AMA) by stating, “I have never heard of ChainAnchor until this question. I don’t have any relationships with any projects that are working on digital identity.”

If you wish to learn more about ChainAnchor, some MIT Connection Science team members will be participating in an AMA on the /r/Bitcoin subreddit on May 3 at 5 p.m. Eastern.",Technical,-0.757
2016/5/11,"Bitcoin Reaches a Crossroads With the Scaling Debate, Not a Crisis","Judging from various reports in the media over the past year, Bitcoin is in a serious crisis that threatens its very existence. Longtime Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn even left the ecosystem entirely and claimed the project is now a failed experiment. Of course, Bitcoin has been proclaimed dead roughly 100 other times.

Scalability is the main concern in Bitcoin right now, but some, including Blockchain Capital Managing Director Brock Pierce, have argued that this is more a sign of success than anything else. The fact that the system needs to scale in order to welcome new users is a sign that people find this technology useful for a variety of use cases.

While it’s important to not become complacent (as longtime cypherpunk Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn recently warned). Blockstream’s Johnny Dilley said recently that much of the distress and panic coming from certain segments of the community is unwarranted. During an interview on The Crypto Show, Dilley said that progress on scalability is being made by the Bitcoin Core developers, and development gridlock is not as big an issue as some would think.

What Is the Worst That Could Happen?

One of the main reasons there is a belief that Bitcoin is reaching a crisis point has to do with blocks filling up to near capacity (at times). As blocks fill with transactions, a bidding war ensues for the right to get one’s transaction into a block (and confirmed) in a timely manner. In response to this potential issue, Dilley told The Crypto Show:

“The absolute worst thing that could happen to Bitcoin right now is the classic analog: Nobody goes to that restaurant anymore; it’s always full.”

This point reiterates Pierce’s recent statement on how Bitcoin’s scalability issue is a sign of its success. In his remark, Dilley was echoing comments made by BitTorrent creator Bram Cohen in June 2015.

To get a second opinion on Bitcoin’s possible crisis point, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Digital Currency Council Director of Curriculum & Content Dan McArdle, who believes on-chain transactions should be kept as cheap as possible for as long as possible (via an increase to Bitcoin’s block size limit and other means).

In regard to Dilley’s (or more rightly Cohen’s) restaurant analogy, McArdle responded, “Well, that one restaurant may be crowded, but by not expanding quickly when there's ample demand, it's inviting competitors to eat its lunch.”

McArdle added that Bitcoin has had no competition in the blockchain-based electronic cash market up to this point, but he fears the door to more competition is opened as Bitcoin is “hot-wired for settlement,” as Bitcoin Classic developers Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik have referred to it, via Bitcoin Core’s development roadmap for capacity increases.

Scaling Progress Continues to Be Made

While figuring out how to allow more people to use Bitcoin is indeed an issue, Dilley said that work is being done to help solve this problem.

“To be clear, the slow, mediated, not-compromised and technically sound progress continues to be made,” he said. “The things that are in Bitcoin’s best interest continue to get done.”

The recently released Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 is perhaps the strongest evidence to back up Dilley’s claim. This release includes a soft fork for CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY, which allows for relative locktimes and is hugely important for the development of the Lightning Network, which Blockstream CTO and Bitcoin Core contributor Greg Maxwell views as Bitcoin’s best chance at handling increasing demand for Bitcoin transactions. Bloq co-founder Jeff Garzik disagrees and views sidechains as a better option.

Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 was also the first time the group of contributors behind the project used BIP 9 (Version Bits) to deploy a soft fork. This method of deployment allows multiple soft forks to be rolled out simultaneously, which means improvements can be implemented more quickly.

Is Bitcoin Threatened by Political Gridlock?

Some members of the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as Bitcoin Foundation chief scientist Gavin Andresen, worry that the difficulties associated with making changes to Bitcoin’s consensus rules are slowing down the development process, but others, such as Bitcoin Core contributor Cory Fields (who is Andresen’s colleague at the MIT Digital Currency Initiative), feel that the inability to implement controversial changes is a sign of strength in terms of Bitcoin’s level of decentralization.

During his interview on The Crypto Show, Dilley compared gridlock in Bitcoin development to gridlock in Congress:

“The differences between political gridlock in Congress and political gridlock in Bitcoin are: One, one doesn’t tax your ****, and two: Bitcoin keeps working.”

Dilley’s point was that Bitcoin would keep working in a scenario where complete gridlock happened and no further changes were possible.

“If every person who could develop on Bitcoin died today (and we assume that there are no security flaws that are going to arise tomorrow that need rapid action) ‒ it will keep working,” he said.

Bitcoin Magazine also asked McArdle for his thoughts on political gridlock in Bitcoin. McArdle referred to this as a “fascinating concept” and admitted that he’s divided on this one. He explained:

“On the one hand, I think gridlock is good if initial conditions are set well (which is, of course, subjective). The U.S. federal government, by design, experiences gridlock in order to ensure that only very important changes occur (theoretically). On the other hand, Bitcoin is a technology that doesn't exist in a vacuum or within some physical border. There has to be a good balance between being nimble and being incorruptible. The ecosystem is only beginning to define its best practices.”

Avoiding a Startup-esque Development Process

One last point made by Dilley on The Crypto Show was that Bitcoin does not use the sort of fast-paced development process that is often found at startups in Silicon Valley. Dilley noted why, in his view, this approach has not been taken by Bitcoin Core contributors:

“We’re talking about $6.5 billion of value, we’re talking about the first attempt for a truly sovereign money. To take an approach where it’s just go as fast as you can until it breaks is not really something that you want to be in place when it comes to Bitcoin.”

Dilley also noted that the fast-paced approach may work when developing a new photo-sharing app, but things work differently when you’re talking about people’s money. He added, “If Bitcoin goes dark for six hours, the game is over, and cryptocurrency gets set back 10 years.”

A Crossroads Rather Than a Crisis

Although some say Bitcoin currently is in a crisis, McArdle defines the current situation as a crossroads. He told Bitcoin Magazine:

“There are competing visions for how to upgrade the system and they have different long-term tradeoffs. But on a technical level, either will work, and one (or both) will soon be implemented, so I don't think it's fair to say that this is a full-blown ‘crisis.’”

In terms of his preference for Bitcoin’s future direction, McArdle added:

“Throwing in the towel on main-chain scaling now, in favor of a ‘settlement-layer’ approach due to the realization that blocksize can't scale forever is a little bit like throwing the baby out with the bathwater.”

McArdle believes Bitcoin should scale via on-chain and layer-2 solutions.

“It doesn't have to be one or the other,” he said, “and main-chain fees don't have to rise soon, even with significantly increasing usage.”

As far as the declarations that the Bitcoin experiment is over, McArdle finds such claims to be vastly premature and more-or-less absurd. Although he’s concerned that many in the Bitcoin ecosystem are willing to accept higher on-chain fees, ignore the competitive landscape and opt for more complex solutions (at least in his view), he added, “None of that means Bitcoin is failing by any means.”

McArdle shared these final thoughts on Bitcoin’s crossroads moment:

“When I first started researching Bitcoin in 2011, I realized that it had the potential to be the best form of money humanity has ever created. And that's still true today. After all, money in all forms, be it seashells or government-issued digits in a bank account, is just a societal ledger used to reduce the friction of exchange. Bitcoin is the most irrefutable, global, low-friction ledger ever created. We should make sure that however Bitcoin grows, all of those properties remain intact.”",Technical,0.5414
2016/5/16,Bloq’s Paul Sztorc on the 4 Main Benefits of Sidechains,"Most people in the Bitcoin community know Paul Sztorc for his work on the Truthcoin concept (now backed by Roger Ver and currently in development as Bitcoin Hivemind), but the former Yale statistician also recently joined blockchain startup Bloq (of which Bitcoin Core contributor Jeff Garzik is a co-founder) under the role of economist.

In a recent message to the Bitcoin development mailing list, Sztorc attempted to jump-start the conversation on a potential BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) to enable two-way pegged sidechains on the Bitcoin network.

Sztorc noted the inclusion of a new opcode (currently going by the name OP_CheckVotesVerify) that could be added to Bitcoin via a soft fork. Although the main purpose of his email was to kick off the technical discussion around a specific two-way peg implementation, Sztorc also noted four of the key benefits that sidechains may bring to Bitcoin.

1. Optional Hard Forks

The first benefit of sidechains mentioned by Sztorc was what he called “optional hard forks.” He noted, “Sidechains allow 'opt in' adoption of new features.”

In addition to allowing innovation to take place that would usually happen on a blockchain in an alternative cryptocurrency (altcoin) network, Sztorc added that the changes to Bitcoin’s consensus rules found in Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin XT could also be implemented as sidechains.

When those alternative protocol designs are implemented as sidechains, it makes the changes optional because users can still decide to remain on the main Bitcoin blockchain. If Bitcoin Classic or Bitcoin XT were implemented via a hard fork (activated by 75 percent support from the network hashrate), it would essentially coerce everyone on the network to play by these new rules.

2. Staging Upgrades

According to Sztorc, sidechains also allow Bitcoin to be upgraded in stages. He explained:

“Sidechains allow complex updates to Bitcoin to be tested in a realistic environment (where actual BTC are at risk and utilizing actual network mining resources). If these updates fail, they can be revised; if they succeed, they can be incorporated into the mainchain.”

Currently, new features are not tested on the live Bitcoin network. Instead, test networks are created to try out new features without risking large amounts of real value. For a large portion of the Bitcoin community, including Sztorc, altcoins are mainly viewed as testnets.

3. Directing Blockchain Resources to Bitcoin

With the flexibility offered by sidechains, it makes more sense for resources (developers, money, public attention, etc.) to be directed toward the Bitcoin currency network. Instead of splitting the idea of cryptocurrency into many different networks, sidechains allow the vast majority of the innovation to take place on the same network. In this regard, sidechains are intended to strengthen Bitcoin’s network effects.

4. Returning to a Culture of Permissionless Innovation

One last benefit of sidechains mentioned by Sztorc was that, with this improvement to Bitcoin, more time can be spent on permissionless innovation.

Sidechains mean “less time spent debating controversial features,” he said.

This final point ties in with the first point of optional hard forks. With sidechains, consensus from the entire network is not needed to try out something new.

What Happens Next?

Although the sidechains concept has received large amounts of interest and praise from the Bitcoin community (both technical and otherwise), doubts still exist. Most notably, Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd has voiced his concerns over the security of merge-mined sidechains.

As recently as this month, Todd has said, “[Merge-mined sidechains] are a broken idea that fundamentally means miners have the ability to steal coins, and makes the scaling problem a lot worse.”

Bitcoin Foundation Chief Scientist Gavin Andresen (who often disagrees with Todd’s point of view) also sees possible issues with sidechains. In a recent AMA on 8btc, Andresen wrote, “I think sidechains are a good idea, but the main problem is finding a good way to keep them secure.”

The most recent work in regard to a two-way peg mechanism for sidechains comes in the form of a paper by RSK Labs (the company behind Rootstock) co-founder and Chief Scientist Sergio Lerner. The paper builds on work by Blockstream on the original sidechains concept and a more-recent proposal, drivechains, from Sztorc.

2016/5/23,Antpool Will Not Run SegWit Without Bitcoin Block Size Increase Hard Fork,"Although there has been some serious, public drama over scaling in the Bitcoin community for over a year, it appears that the community is mostly unified behind a single plan going forward, which is based on the “Bitcoin Roundtable Consensus.” There are still high-profile individuals, such as former Bitcoin Core lead maintainer Gavin Andresen and longtime Bitcoin angel investor Roger Ver, who would like to see an increase in the block size limit as soon as possible.

Support for Bitcoin Classic, which intends to deploy a block size limit increase to 2 megabytes via a hard fork, currently sits around 5 percent of the network hashrate, and representatives from the vast majority of Bitcoin miners and mining pools have no intention of breaking the previous agreement to run only Bitcoin Core software for the foreseeable future.

Bitcoin Magazine recently chatted with Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu about his current thoughts on Segregated Witness (SegWit), hard forks and the recent Beijing meeting between BIP 109 supporters and the Chinese Bitcoin mining industry. Bitmain runs one of the top two Bitcoin mining pools in the world, Antpool. The pool accounted for roughly 22 percent of all mined blocks over the four days prior to publication.

Comments on the Beijing Meeting

Bitcoin Magazine previously reported on a somewhat secretive meeting in Beijing that took place near the end of March. BTCC COO Samson Mow referred to the meeting as a “train wreck,” which is a description that some, such as Roger Ver, found to be inaccurate.

When asked if he would refer to the meeting as a train wreck, Wu responded, “It depends how you define ‘train wreck.’ If it describes the status that no agreement [was] reached, it is a ‘yes.’”

Wu went on to clarify that an agreement, like the one made in Hong Kong, was not the purpose of the Beijing meeting (in his view). He explained:

“We discussed lots of potential solutions around the scaling issues and debated possible problems with those ideas. As there is no intention to corner anyone into any promise, everyone feels free to discuss all possible ways of future actions. The meeting let everyone know about the position of each other very well.”

When asked if he thinks the Bitcoin Core roadmap is sufficient, Wu responded, “If (a soon and big enough) block size limit increase does [become] a part of the scaling roadmap, and the Lightning Network is ready soon enough, I think it will be sufficient for at least a few years from now.”

Antpool Will Not Run Bitcoin Classic, May Delay SegWit

During his conversation with Bitcoin Magazine, Wu confirmed that Antpool is testing Segregated Witness (SegWit) right now, and the mining pool will not be running Bitcoin Classic in a production environment for the foreseeable future. Wu added that Bitmain is honoring the Hong Kong agreement, “even though lots of people think that SegWit is not ‘released’ as there is only a pull request.”

It should be clarified that there was no explicit promise to release Segregated Witness by April in the Hong Kong agreement. Having said that, Wu put the agreement in the following context:

“The context is that SegWit will be released in a very timely manner to address the block size scarcity problems in the near future. The China Bitcoin community side, including exchanges, wallets and miners, [are] concerned very much about the short-term problem. [The] SegWit release date was repetitively stated as in April. So delay of SegWit is a problem, though most of the parties will understand this problem and continue to act in good faith.”

Wu also shared his views on whether the current state of Segregated Witness can be viewed as a true release:

“By ‘release,’ it should be always a functioning, well-tested binary software that can let people to run safely in good faith. A code which is not merged, not tested, not agreed by their decision community is not a ‘release.’ There are several ‘release[s]’ in the agreement, and every ‘release’ has the same implication or meaning.”

Before running Segregated Witness code in a production environment, Wu would like to see the hard fork code discussed in the Hong Kong agreement implemented in a release of Bitcoin Core. Wu explained:

“We are waiting for the July hard fork code promised in the February Hong Kong meeting. We and other mining pools will want to talk to Core again after the hard fork code is public before we take next steps.”

When asked specifically whether Antpool would run SegWit code without a hard fork increase in the block size also included in a release of Bitcoin Core, Wu responded:

“No. It is acceptable that the hard fork code is not activated, but it needs to be included in a ‘release’ of Bitcoin Core. I have made it clear about the definition of ‘release,’ which is not ‘public.’”

Some of the Bitcoin Core contributors who signed the Hong Kong agreement recently met in New York to discuss what should be in the proposed hard fork. The details of the proposed hard fork are expected to be known soon, and a thread on the Bitcoin development mailing list indicates a way to block the ASICBoost proposal has been discussed.

In the current environment, developers expect that an increase to the block size limit via a hard fork is unlikely to be merged into Bitcoin Core. Having said that, Bitcoin Core contributor and spokesperson Eric Lombrozo told Bitcoin Magazine that an increase via a soft fork is a possibility. Increases via a soft fork, such as extension blocks, have been discussed in the past.

It should be noted that Segregated Witness is also, effectively, an increase in the block size limit to roughly 1.7 megabytes. Schnorr signatures is another optimization that would allow more transactions to fit in each block.

In Lombrozo’s view, hard forks should not be deployed under political pressure while animosity still exists between different segments of the community.

In the context of Antpool’s current views on scaling, the lack of a hard fork deployment in Bitcoin Core could delay the activation of a Segregated Witness soft fork.

Wu: A Hard Fork is Still Needed

While Bitmain is sticking with the Hong Kong agreement, Jihan Wu is worried whether Bitcoin Core will implement an increase to the block size limit. He noted the possibility of a “disaster” if the block size limit is not increased that would be caused by transaction delays and fee increases, but he understands that the Bitcoin Core contributors who attended the Hong Kong meeting cannot speak for those who were not there.

Wu noted that block space has a perfectly inelastic supply, which he noted is an economic term that is not often applied to the real world. He added, “I really don't want the whole community to experience serious problems as a consequence of making [the] wrong choice.”

Wu did mention that Blockstream President Adam Back’s recent presentation at Paralelni Polis was a positive sign. He stated:

“The [recent] presentation by Adam Back for Slush showed that they have been taking the block size increase problem into serious consideration. It is a positive sign. We hope that the Core community members, especially those who have veto rights in their decision-making process, can realize the [importance of] increases [in] the main block size.”

In terms of when a block size limit increase is needed, Wu added:

“We need to do it fast. The block size increase is, after all, a short term solution for emergency problems. Delaying to increase the block size will bring lots of problems, which mostly become the pain of Bitcoin enterprises such as exchanges and wallets.”

To illustrate  his concern regarding the need for more block space, Wu shared a question asked by HaoBTC CEO Wu Gang during the Hong Kong meeting in February. Wu paraphrased:

“Lots of on-chain transactions pop up now. The demand for Bitcoin transactions is higher and higher. What if SegWit and the Lighting Network cannot be ready and adaptive to the demand soon enough? Will we just ask the users to wait until we have finished the SegWit soft fork and Lightning Network?”

Wu added that Gang’s question was not answered.

Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd to get an answer to Gang’s question:

“Unfortunately Bitcoin simply doesn't scale well, so we don't have any easy way to respond to increased demand other than the fee market; block size can be bumped, but that increases centralization. The fee market does mean that the lowest valued transactions get priced out of the market, but now that fee estimation is widely supported, and wallets are beginning to add support for replace-by-fee fee bumping, we do have good mechanisms for users to outbid those lowest valued transactions and keep using Bitcoin. This isn't a great answer I agree, but there's not much more we can do without fundamental improvements to Bitcoin's scalability.”",Technical,-0.9431
2016/5/31,"Understanding the Lightning Network, Part 1: Building a Bidirectional Bitcoin Payment Channel","The Lightning Network is probably the most highly anticipated technological innovation to be deployed on top of Bitcoin. The payment layer, first proposed by Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja about a year ago, promises to support a virtually unlimited number of off-chain transactions among users, at nearly no cost – while leveraging the security offered by Bitcoin.

At least three companies – Poon and Dryja's Lightning, Blockstream and Blockchain – are currently working on implementations of the technology. But few outside this small technological frontline fully grasp how the “future of micropayments” is set to boost Bitcoin’s capabilities.

In this three-part series, Bitcoin Magazine lays out the basic building blocks of the Lightning Network, and shows how they fit together to realize this upcoming protocol layer.

This first part of the series establishes the necessary building blocks, and shows how these can be combined to create “smart contracts,” which can be applied to realize the first requirement of the Lightning Network: a bidirectional payment channel.

(Note: Anyone with a solid understanding of Bitcoin can skip the building blocks.)

Building Block #1: Unconfirmed Transactions

At its heart, the Bitcoin protocol consists of transactions, that are typically linked to previous transactions, and potentially to future transactions. Each transaction contains inputs, which refer to addresses bitcoins are sent from, and outputs, which refer to addresses bitcoins are sent to. Additionally, inputs must include the requirements to send the bitcoins, like signatures that prove “ownership” of the input-addresses. Outputs, meanwhile, establish the new requirements, that must be included in the input of a subsequent transaction.

As one of its key features, the Lightning Network is built up from more or less regular Bitcoin transactions. It's just that these transactions are typically not actually broadcast over the Bitcoin network. Instead, they are stored locally, on the nodes of users - but they can be broadcast over the network at any time.

Unconfirmed Transaction
Building Block #2: Double-Spend Protection

The second building block for the Lightning Network probably doesn't require much explaining, as it's arguably the raison d'être for Bitcoin itself: double-spend protection. If two transactions (or: inputs) rely on the same output, only one can confirm.

The important thing to keep in mind here is that even unconfirmed transactions can be conflicting, meaning only one can ever confirm.

Double Spend
Building Block #3: Multisig

The third building block of the Lightning Network is also a straightforward one: multisignature (multisig) addresses. (Or more generally: P2SH-addresses.)

Multisig addresses are Bitcoin addresses that – as the name suggests - require multiple private keys to “unlock” and spend bitcoins from. Multisig addresses can be set up under all sorts of conditions. For instance to require two out of three possible keys, or fifteen out of fifteen, or just about any other combination.

The Lightning Network often uses two out of two (2-of-2) multisig set-ups. Unlocking bitcoins from 2-of-2 multisig addresses requires two signatures, from two dedicated keys.

Multisig
Building Block #4: Time-Locks

The fourth building block is the time-lock. Time-locks can “lock bitcoins up” in an output, to make them spendable (to be included in a subsequent input) only at some point in the future.

There are two different types of time-locks: the absolute type, called CheckLockTimeVerify (CLTV), and the relative type, CheckSequenceVerify (CSV). CLTV locks bitcoins up until a (more or less) concrete time in the future: an actual time and date, or a specific block height. CSV, instead, uses relative time. Once a CVS-output is recorded on the blockchain, it takes a specific amount of blocks from that point on before the bitcoins can be spent again.

Timelock
Building Block #5: Hash Values and Secrets

The fifth and final building block – cryptography - is the most fundamental building block of Bitcoin itself. But in the Lightning Network, it’s applied in a new way.

In short, a “value” or “secret” is a long and unique string of numbers that is practically impossible to guess, even for a computer with infinite tries. With a special calculation, this value (or secret) can be “hashed” into a different string of numbers, a “hash.” And here's the trick: anyone who knows the value can easily reproduce the hash. But this doesn't work the other way around; it's a one way street.

This trick can be utilized in Bitcoin itself, again to “lock bitcoins up.” (In fact, it's really how Bitcoin works.) For example, a hash can be included in an output, and require the subsequent input to include the corresponding value in order to be spendable.

Secret
The First Challenge: Bidirectional Payment Channels

Even before the Lightning Network was presented, the concept of payment channels had been around for some time. Typical payment channels are useful for certain purposes, but also limited: they are one-directional. Alice can pay Bob several off-chain transactions, but Bob cannot pay Alice through the same channel at all.

As a key feature of the Lightning Network, Poon and Dryja proposed trustless bidirectional payment channels.

Opening the Channel

To set up a bidirectional payment channel, both parties involved must first agree on an opening transaction. This opening transaction determines how many bitcoins each deposits into the channel.

Let's say Alice wants to send one bitcoin to Bob. Since Alice and Bob expect to transact more frequently, they decide to open up a bidirectional payment channel, and use this to send the bitcoin. (Sending a whole bitcoin is probably a lot for a payment channel, as these might be more useful for micropayments – but it's perfectly possible.)

To open the channel, Alice and Bob each send five bitcoins to a 2-of-2 multisig address. This is the “opening transaction.” Bitcoins can only be spent from this address if both Alice and Bob sign a subsequent transaction.

Additionally, Alice and Bob both create a secret (a string of numbers), and exchange the hash.

Alice now immediately creates a subsequent transaction from the opening transaction. This is a “commitment transaction.” With the commitment transaction, Alice sends four bitcoins to herself, and six bitcoins to a second multisig address. This second multisig address is a bit funky. It can be unlocked by Bob on his own, but only after 1000 extra blocks have been mined after it’s included on the blockchain; it includes a CSV-lock. Or, it can be opened by Alice on her own, but only if she also includes the secret for which Bob has just now given her the hash. (Of course, Alice has no idea what this secret is – she only knows hash – so there's no way she can make use of this option right now.)

Alice signs her end of this commitment transaction. But she doesn't broadcast it! Instead, she gives it to Bob.

Meanwhile, Bob does the same, but mirrored. He creates a commitment transaction as well, from which he sends six bitcoins to himself, and four to a funky new multisig-address. Alice can unlock this address if she waits an additional 1000 blocks, or Bob can unlock it with Alice using her secret.

Bob signs this half, and gives it to Alice.

After all this exchanging of “half-valid” commitment transactions and hashes of secrets, they both sign and broadcast the opening transaction, to make sure it's recorded on the blockchain. The channel is now officially open.

At this point, both Alice and Bob could sign and broadcast the half-valid commitment transaction they got from the other. If Alice does, Bob gets six bitcoins immediately. If Bob does, Alice gets four bitcoins immediately. But whomever signs and broadcasts the transaction will have to wait 1000 blocks to unlock the subsequent multisig-address, and claim the remaining bitcoins.

Payment Channel A
However, and this is the key trick of a payment channel: neither sign and broadcast their half of the transaction at all.

Updating the Channel

A little later, Bob wants to send Alice one bitcoin back. They want to update the channel state, to make the balance five-five again. To accomplish this, Alice and Bob do two things.

First, both repeat the process as described above (except that the opening transaction is already recorded on the blockchain; that part is skipped). This time, both Alice and Bob attribute themselves five bitcoins, and both attribute five bitcoins to funky multisig-addresses. The conditions for these multisig-addresses are similar, except that they require new secrets: both Alice and Bob provide each other withnew hashes. They both sign their new half valid commitment transaction, and give it to each other.

Second, Alice and Bob hand each other their first secrets, as used in the first set-up.

At this point, again, both Alice and Bob could sign and broadcast the new “half valid” commitment transaction they just got. Their counterparty would get five bitcoins immediately, while the broadcaster would have to wait 1000 blocks. As such, the channel is updated.

But what's stopping Bob from broadcasting the older commitment transaction instead? That commitment transaction led to a path that paid him six bitcoins, instead of five….

What’s stopping Bob, of course, is his first secret, which he has now given to Alice.

Bob cannot safely sign and broadcast the older commitment transaction any more, because Alice now knows Bob's first secret. If Bob were to sign and broadcast that commitment transaction, he would immediately send four bitcoins to Alice... and he would have to wait 1000 blocks to claim his own six bitcoins. That's a problem, because now that Alice knows his secret, she could use this time to beat Bob to the punch, and claim the other six bitcoins as well!

And since Bob has Alice’s secret too, this is just as true for the other way around. If Alice tries to sign and broadcast an old commitment transaction, Bob can steal all the bitcoins in the channel.

This of course means that both Alice and Bob are strongly incentivized to play fair, and only ever sign and broadcast the most recent state of the channel.

Payment Channel B
Next, this bidirectional payment channel set-up needs to expand to allow payments over a network. This is covered in the second article of this series.",Technical,0.9924
2016/6/7," Understanding the Lightning Network, Part 2: Creating the Network","The Lightning Network is the probably most highly anticipated technological innovation to be deployed on top of Bitcoin. The payment layer, first proposed by Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja about a year ago, promises to support a virtually unlimited number of off-chain transactions among users, at nearly no cost – while leveraging the security offered by Bitcoin.

At least three companies – Poon and Dryja's Lightning, Blockstream and Blockchain – are currently working on implementations of the technology. But few outside this small technological frontline fully grasp how the “future of micropayments” is set to boost Bitcoin’s capabilities.

In this three-part series, Bitcoin Magazine lays out the basic building blocks of the Lightning Network, and shows how they fit together to realize this upcoming protocol layer.

The first part of this series covered basic building blocks, and explained how these are used to establish bidirectional payment channels. This second part explains how bidirectional payment channels are turned into a network.

The Network

In the previous article, Alice and Bob established a bidirectional payment channel. Now, Alice wants to pay one bitcoin to a third person, Carol.

To do so, Alice and Carol could open up a payment channel between them. But they don't actually need to. As it turns out, Bob and Carol already have a mutual channel, so Alice can simply pay Carol through Bob.

Specifically, Alice can pay Bob one bitcoin, and Bob can pay Carol one bitcoin.

However, Alice doesn't really trust Bob – or Carol for that matter. She's afraid that if she pays Bob, Bob will never actually pay Carol. Or perhaps Bob will pay Carol, but Carol will claim she never received the money, and Alice wouldn't know whom to blame.

Alice, therefore, wants to ensure that she only pays Bob one bitcoin, if he also pays Carol one bitcoin. This is accomplished (in part) with a simple cryptographic trick.

When Alice wants to send Carol a bitcoin, she tells Carol to create a value (a random string of numbers) and send her the hash. Alice also tells Carol to exchange the original value with Bob for a bitcoin.

Alice, meanwhile, takes the hash from Carol, turns to Bob, and tells Bob she will give him a bitcoin if he provides her the corresponding value (which only Carol has). 

So, Bob turns to Carol, and gives Carol one bitcoin in return for the value.

Then, Bob turns back to Alice with the value. Alice knows Bob must have gotten the value from Carol in exchange for a bitcoin, and therefore concludes Carol got her bitcoin. So Alice can confidently give Bob a bitcoin.

Everybody is happy.

Network
Well. .. almost everybody is happy.

In this “naive” scenario, middleman Bob still has to trust Alice and Carol. Bob has to trust Carol to really give him the value after he sent her a bitcoin, and Bob has to trust Alice to really give him a bitcoin once he presents her the value.

The bitcoin-for-value trades must therefore be absolutely guaranteed along the network. More specifically: if Bob gives a bitcoin to Carol, he must be guaranteed to get a bitcoin back from Alice.

That's where Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) come in.

Hash Time-Locked Contracts

So Alice and Bob want to exchange a bitcoin for the value through an HTLC. (And Bob and Carol also want to a bitcoin exchange for that same value - but never mind that for now.)

To do so, rather than sending Bob a bitcoin straight up, Alice sends a bitcoin to a new (and, again: funky) multisig address. The bitcoins locked up on this address can be unlocked in two different ways.

The first option is for Bob to include his signature and the value.

The second option is for Alice to include her own signature. However, this option has a CLTV-timelock on it: Alice can sign and broadcast the transaction only after – say – two weeks have gone by.

This means that Bob has two weeks to create a subsequent transaction in which he includes his signature and the value, and broadcast it to send the bitcoin from the funky multisig address to himself. As such, this trade is guaranteed. Bob can only claim Alice's bitcoin if he provides the value: broadcasting it over the Bitcoin network makes it publicly visible for Alice to see.

And if Bob doesn’t provide the value in time, there is a “time-out alternative” for Alice to get her bitcoin back. Simple.

Hash Time-Locked Contract
Back to the network, as that’s really why this HTLC setup is needed. 

As mentioned, not only Alice and Bob, but also Bob and Carol established an HTLC. So, if Carol claims her bitcoin from Bob, Bob will get the value in return; it will be visible on the blockchain.

Therefore, if that happens, Bob is guaranteed to get a bitcoin from Alice as well. Bob can take the value that Carol made publicly visible on the blockchain, include it in his HTLC with Alice, and claim a bitcoin for himself, too. The two channels are effectively linked.

As a final detail, it is important that Bob gets the value from Carol before Alice can reclaim her bitcoin from Bob. If Bob gets the value from Carol only after Alice already reclaimed hers back, Bob is stuck in the middle after all. The time-out in Bob and Carol’s HTLC must therefore expire before the time-out in Alice and Bob’s HTLC expires. (For example after exactly ten days, instead of two weeks. This is also why HTLCs need CheckLockTimeVerify (CLTV)--and not CheckSequenceVerify (CSV).)

Networked Hash Time-Locked Contract
Lastly, there's one more problem to solve: for the Lightning Network to be useful, all this must be accomplished off-chain. How this is done, is covered in the third and final article of this series.",Technical,0.296
2016/6/17,"Understanding the Lightning Network, Part 3: Completing the Puzzle and Closing the Channel","The Lightning Network is probably the most highly anticipated technological innovation that will be deployed on top of Bitcoin. The payment layer, first proposed by Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja about a year ago, promises to support a virtually unlimited number of off-chain transactions among users, at nearly no cost – while leveraging the security offered by Bitcoin.

At least three companies – Poon and Dryja's Lightning, Blockstream and Blockchain – are currently working on implementations of the technology. But few outside this small technological frontline fully grasp how the “future of micropayments” is set to boost Bitcoin’s capabilities.

In this three-part series, Bitcoin Magazine lays out the basic building blocks of the Lightning Network, and shows how they fit together to realize this upcoming protocol layer.

The first part of this series covered basic building blocks, and explained how these are used to establish bidirectional payment channels. The second part explained how a network is formed, and how Hash Timelock Contracts (HTLCs) link different channels in the network together. This third and final part of the series explains how HTLCs are placed inside bidirectional payment channels to ensure transactions can occur fully off-chain.

The Lightning Network

So far, Alice and Bob opened a bidirectional payment channel, which they both funded with five bitcoins. They've made two transactions back and forth, and at the current channel state, both Alice and Bob can claim five bitcoins for themselves by “dropping the channel” on the blockchain.

Now, they want to include an HTLC in the channel. This is to ensure that if Carol claims a bitcoin from Bob in return for her value, Bob is guaranteed a bitcoin from Alice in return.

Like the previous step, Alice and Bob start by creating a new commitment transaction each. In many ways, these commitment transactions are very similar to previous commitment transactions. They include a normal output, and an output to a funky multisig-address with a CSV (CheckSequenceVerify)-timelock and a special hash-lock. Likewise, as in the previous step, Alice and Bob exchange their old secrets, to effectively invalidate the old channel. And, once exchanged, both Alice and Bob can sign their halves of the commitment transactions and potentially drop them on the blockchain at any time.

All familiar territory. Except for one change. Both Alice’s and Bob's commitment transactions now include one new output, worth one bitcoin. (This makes the balance 4-5-1; four for Alice, five for Bob, one for the new output.)

This new output is essentially the HTLC. And it's even funkier than all other outputs so far, because there are three ways to unlock it.

First, the new output (in both Alice’s and Bob's commitment transactions) releases the bitcoin on condition that Bob's signature and the value is included in the subsequent transaction. As such, regardless of whether Alice or Bob signs and broadcasts the commitment transaction, only Bob can unlock this output – if he includes the value. But there is one small difference between the two commitment transactions: if Bob drops the channel, there is a CSV-timelock involved. He will need to wait 1,000 blocks. (If Alice drops the channel he can claim this bitcoin immediately.)

The reason Bob has to wait 1,000 blocks if he drops the channel is very similar to what we've seen before: It allows Alice to take this bitcoin in case Bob ever tries to sign and broadcast an old channel state. That's where the second way to unlock the output comes in. Alice can “steal” the funds if she provides Bob's (newest) secret. 

Two can play this game: If Alice ever tries to cheat and broadcast this channel when it's already outdated, Bob can claim this bitcoin using Alice’s secret. (He wouldn't even need to provide the value.)

And third, as with any other HTLC, both commitment transactions also include the usual CLTV time-out fall-back for Alice. If Bob does not include the value in - say - two weeks (for instance because he didn't get it from Carol), Alice can claim her bitcoin back. Again, whether Alice or Bob drops the channel doesn't matter for this option.

So where did all this get us?

Both Alice and Bob hold a half-valid commitment transaction. If Alice drops her commitment transaction on the blockchain, she immediately sends five bitcoins to Bob. Additionally, she can wait for 1,000 blocks, and claim four bitcoins for herself. Plus, Bob has two weeks to provide the value, and claim the bitcoin in “HTLC output.” (If he doesn't provide the value in two weeks, Alice can claim this bitcoin back.)

Bob, meanwhile, can drop his commitment transaction at any time as well, and immediately send four bitcoins to Alice. Then, he'd have wait 1,000 blocks to claim five more bitcoins from one address, and another bitcoin from the HTLC output if he provides the value. (If he doesn't provide the value in two weeks, Alice can reclaim it.)

And of course, if either Alice or Bob tries to cheat at any point in the future, and sign and broadcast this channel when it’s outdated, both can completely block the other, and steal all bitcoins in the channel.

Payment Channel
Settling the Status

At this point, Bob is guaranteed to receive a bitcoin in exchange for the value (assuming he has it). All he has to do is sign and broadcast the commitment transaction he got from Alice, include the value in a subsequent transaction, and sign and broadcast that as well.

Alice knows this. There is no way she can cheat Bob out of his bitcoin – not even if she found out what the value is through some other means.

As such, the two might as well just “settle” outside of the channel. Bob can simply give the value to Alice, and Alice can agree to update the channel status to the more normal state without the HTLC and the time-out deadline.

Assuming both parties want to keep the channel open, that's what they would naturally do: it's less of a hassle than having to drop the channel on the blockchain.

Payment Channel
Closing the Channel

And finally, here's the real power of the Lightning Network: Almost everything described in these three articles will typically never need to hit the Bitcoin blockchain at all.

If both Alice and Bob want to close the channel “peacefully” they can simply create a transaction from the original opening transaction to override everything that happened since the opening transaction. From this closing transaction, they send themselves their fair share of the channel, as represented by the most recent channel state.

Concretely, this means that if Alice wants to close the channel, she can at this point simply create a transaction paying herself four bitcoins and Bob six, and ask Bob to sign and broadcast the transaction. Since there is no reason for him not to, he will probably cooperate and close the channel.

In the end, only two transactions will have been broadcast over the Bitcoin network and included in a block: the opening and the closing transactions. That will hold true even if Alice and Bob transact a million times in between, therefore unloading a huge burden away from the blockchain.

2016/6/30,Does BIP 75 Really Threaten Bitcoin’s Fungibility?,"On Wednesday, the Bitcoin community went into a tizzy over BIP 75 (BIP stands for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) which is, in short, a layer-2 protocol for improving the user friendliness of Bitcoin payments.

The community, especially on Reddit, is concerned that the option to identify oneself to the sender or receiver of a payment may lead down the road toward know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) restrictions on the Bitcoin protocol. The hysteria around this proposal appears to have emerged from a post made by Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd to the Bitcoin development mailing list.

Peter Todd recommends boycotting BIP75 due to AML/KYC concerns.

What Is BIP 75?

Before getting into the controversy, it’s important to understand the details of BIP 75. Bitcoin Magazine reported on the proposal’s ability to simplify wallets for the average Joe earlier this year, but here are the key points:

BIP 75 attempts to solve some of the privacy and security concerns with the Payment Protocol, which was outlined by former Bitcoin Core lead maintainer, Gavin Andresen and former Bitcoin developer, Mike Hearn in BIP 70.
Unlike BIP 70, BIP 75 features end-to-end encryption.
Human-readable names can be used to make the payment process more user-friendly and create a Venmo-esque experience in Bitcoin wallets.
The co-authors of BIP 75 are from Netki (Justin Newton and Matt David) and Breadwallet (Aaron Voisine and James MacWhyte).

What Are the Concerns With BIP 75?

There are currently two separate concerns with BIP 75 being discussed in the Bitcoin community. For one, some people believe that this BIP could make it easier to trace Bitcoin payments to real-world identities or simply streamline KYC and AML compliance for Bitcoin. The other issue is whether this BIP should be included in the main BIPs section of the Bitcoin Core GitHub repository.

“I'd strongly argue that we remove BIP 75 from the BIPs repository and boycott wallets that implement it,” Peter Todd recently stated on the Bitcoin development mailing list. “It's bad strategy for Bitcoin developers to willingly participate in AML [and] KYC [compliance], just the same way as it's bad for Tor to add wiretapping functionality and W3C to support DRM tech. The minor tactical wins you'll get [out] of this aren't worth it.”

A Reddit thread linking to that post on the Bitcoin development mailing list was quickly filled with calls for a boycott on Breadwallet.

Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Todd to gain a clearer picture of his thoughts on the matter. In terms of whether the BIP should be removed from the Bitcoin Core GitHub repository, Todd said, “I think we should remove it because, like it or not, we are putting a stamp of approval on it, to a degree.”

Some others, such as Bitcoin Core contributor Pieter Wuille, believe a removal would amount to censorship; however, Todd also pointed out that, in the past, a proper BIP for a colored coins standard has also been denied access to the GitHub repo.

When it comes to the issues he sees with BIP 75 more generally, Todd said, “BIP 75 institutionalizes [regulatory compliance] in a convenient way that everyone can easily use and expect. We should comply with AML [and] KYC [regulations] only grudgingly.

“In much the same way that we have the threat of Tor nodes keeping logs; we don't help that process by creating a standard for those logs,” Todd added.

To Todd’s point, BIP 75 does make it easier for companies (financial in nature or not) to collect data on their customers. While the threat of a government forcing normal retailers to collect identifying information about customers who use Bitcoin always existed, BIP 75 has the potential to streamline this process.

During his conversation with Bitcoin Magazine, Todd made it clear that he’s more concerned with senders of bitcoins identifying themselves than the recipients of those funds. “The part of BIP 75 that's about determining who you're sending money to isn't objectionable, just the idea of trying to figure out who is actually sending the funds,” he stated.

Those who disagree with Todd would point out that BIP 75 is a completely opt-in protocol. To this point, Todd responded, “Blacklists can also be implemented in an ‘opt-in’ way; that doesn't mean we should support the concept.”

BIP 75 Author Responds

Bitcoin Magazine also reached out to one of the authors of BIP 75, Netki CEO Justin Newton. One of the first things Newton was able to clarify was that the personally-identifying information sent in the payment protocol can be seen only by the sender and receiver involved in a particular transaction.

“We actually added another layer of encryption (at the application layer) as a way to protect against the data being man-in-the-middled,” said Newton.

According to Newton, a BIP 75 user does not even have to trust his or her own phone or laptop to keep payment info private when a hardware wallet is used.

Newton also shares similar concerns to Todd and others in terms of a potential slippery slope toward AML and KYC compliance on the vast majority (if not all) of Bitcoin transactions.

“I actually share their concern, but it led me to a different conclusion,” said Newton. “My view was that AML and KYC compliance is going to be required if we want to get to the mass market and we need to ensure it is done in a way that fundamentally protects fungibility, privacy and the open, permissionless nature of Bitcoin. In the absence of a standard that encourages those values, we will end up with hidden systems that do exactly the same thing, but without taking the concerns of the community into account.”

Judging from a Reddit comment by Breadwallet CEO, the wallet maker is not interested in BIP 75 for regulatory compliance reasons. Instead, Breadwallet is mostly interested in the proposal for reasons related to the user-friendliness (or lack thereof) of Bitcoin wallets. BIP 75 enables useful features that are found in more mainstream payment applications (think Venmo) such as human-readable transaction logs and address books. It’s also possible for users to manually track their transaction history on their own, but BIP 75 greatly simplifies the process.

So, Is BIP 75 a Worrisome Proposal?

The BIP 75 debate ties in with many of the other Bitcoin debates that have taken place over the years. Does the community want privacy and security or easy-to-use wallets? Is it worth abandoning some of the early principles of the network in order to seek mass adoption?

In this case, it appears that not much of a trade-off is being made by individuals who wish to use BIP 75-enabled wallets. All of their personal information is end-to-end encrypted and they aren’t likely giving up much (if any) information that wouldn’t already be known by the recipient of a transaction. Also, it’s important to remember that this is a layer-2, opt-in protocol.

Having said that, it’s always important for the Bitcoin community to remain vigilant against attempts to apply traditional financial regulations to the Bitcoin blockchain. After all, Bitcoin’s core value proposition is the ability to transfer value across the internet in a censorship-resistant manner. The people who need Bitcoin as a payment system are those who would normally be blocked from other, traditional systems such as PayPal or credit cards.

It appears that BIP 75 is not a huge move in the wrong direction, but all Bitcoin users should refrain from attaching identifying information to their transactions as often as possible. In addition to that, it wouldn’t hurt to focus on the real problem, which is the need for enhanced privacy features.

Responding to the concerns, Breadwallet Director of Product Management James MacWhyte told Bitcoin Magazine:

""BIP75 puts users in total control of how much information they share and who they share it with. Some people may not realize that you will always be able to choose to share no information and remain anonymous. It is a huge improvement in privacy, and an essential building block in making Bitcoin more accessible and powerful.

""Avoiding address reuse is important for maintaining privacy and security, yet having to manually send a new address every time you want to receive money is cumbersome and inconvenient. We wanted to automate that process, but if your wallet gave out an address to anyone who asked your privacy would not be protected. That’s why we designed BIP75, which will allow us to automatically give out payment addresses only to the people you trust. It is a huge improvement in privacy, and an essential building block in making Bitcoin more accessible and powerful.

""Breadwallet is working hard to make Bitcoin as easy as possible, without jeopardizing our top two priorities: security and privacy for all our users. We will never require personal information in order to use our wallet.""",Technical,-0.4391
2016/7/5,Here’s How Bitcoin's Lightning Network Could Fail,"The Lightning Network is viewed by many in the Bitcoin community as the network’s best hope for long-term scalability. The concept uses payment channels to perform bitcoin transactions off-chain, with the blockchain acting as a sort of backup court system for situations where someone decides not to play nice. The creators of this system for instant micropayments estimate that it could eventually be used to process billions of transactions per second.

While a combination of smart contracts and game theory are used to make sure the system works properly for everyone, Bitcoin Core contributor, Peter Todd, explained a possible failure mode of the Lightning Network at the Bitcoin in Use conference late last month.

Editor's note added at 1:11 EST: The failure mode discussed in this article has been known since the early development of the Lightning Network and is discussed in the white paper. This article is not an attempt to give Peter Todd credit for discovery of the failure mode; he simply provided an overview of the issue during a recent talk.

The Lightning Network’s Failure Mode

The Lightning Network failure scenario described by Todd, takes place when a large number of people on the Bitcoin network need to settle their Lightning Network disputes on the blockchain in a relatively short period of time.

“We do have a failure mode which is: Imagine a whole bunch of these [settlements] have to happen at once,” Todd explained. “There’s only so much data that can go through the bitcoin network and if we had a large number of Lightning channels get closed out very rapidly, how are we going to get them all confirmed? At some point, you run out of capacity.”

In a scenario where a large number of people need to settle their Lightning contracts on the blockchain, the price for doing so could increase substantially as the available space in bitcoin blocks becomes sparse. “At some point some people start losing out because the cost is just higher than what they can afford,” Todd said. “If you have a very large percentage of the network using Lightning, potentially this cost is very high. Potentially, we could get this mass outbreak of failure.”

The way the Lightning Network works, a user must be able to issue a breach remedy transaction in order to keep their counterparty honest. If a user is unable to make the proper transaction on the blockchain in a certain amount of time, their counterparty may be able to take control of bitcoins tied up in the smart contract between the two parties.

What Are the Possible Solutions?

Any situation that allows for coins to be stolen obviously needs to be avoided and according to Todd, there are some theoretical solutions available for this problem. For one, an adaptive block size limit could allow miners to increase capacity in these sorts of failure scenarios. Another possible solution would be to allow users of the Lightning Network to reserve space in future blocks to make sure they can broadcast a transaction on the blockchain before the expiration of a timelock.

Having said that, Todd indicated that a real, vetted solution is not available for this issue at this time. “There’s a whole lot of complexity and we’re not really at the point there where I could go and confidentially say, ‘Yes, we’re going to have the whole world buying coffees with these systems,’” he said. “There’s tons more engineering to be done and I think it’s going to be a slow process ‒ figuring out how all this works.”

What Could Cause This Scenario?

One of the main reasons Todd is concerned about this disaster scenario is that users could be lulled into complacency due to their ignorance as to what everyone else on the network is doing. “It’s very hard for me as a Lightning user to know how many other people are potentially vulnerable to the failure of a whole bunch of Lightning channels all at once,” Todd explained. “I don’t know that information; I can’t necessarily react to that.”

One possible catalyst for the Lightning Network’s failure mode, which has also been articulated by BitGo Engineer, Jameson Lopp, could be too much centralization in the network topology. If a number of big players on the network all fail at once, all of the counterparties connected to those nodes will need to settle their smart contracts on-chain in a timely manner.

“In the Lightning world, your Mt. Gox may not be able to steal your money, but it may cause you to have to do a transaction within a few days, and there might be a million other people like that,” Todd explained.",Technical,-0.902
2016/7/6,Bitcoin Miners Share Optimism as Second Bitcoin Halving Approaches,"The second so-called Bitcoin “block halving” is fast approaching. This week, as three-quarters of all bitcoins have been mined, the block subsidy will decrease from 25 bitcoins per block to 12.5. A key event in Bitcoin's history, eagerly anticipated by some – and perhaps somewhat feared by others.

More than anyone else, Bitcoin miners stand to be affected by the event: producing blocks is their business and the block reward presents the major chunk of their revenue. Having spoken to BTCC COO, Samson Mow, and BitFury CEO, Valery Vavilov, last week, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to other miners to see how they are preparing for the upcoming halving.

What do AntPool's Jihan Wu, Genesis Mining's Marco Krohn, HaoBTC's Eric Mu and Slush Pool's Marek Palatinus expect of the halving?

Optimism

Much like BTCC's Mow and BitFury's Vavilov, all miners Bitcoin Magazine spoke with are approaching the upcoming halving with a general sense of optimism. While a halving of the subsidy cuts directly into their revenue stream, miners recognize this is key to Bitcoin's value proposition.

Wu is the co-founder of Chinese ASIC manufacturer, Bitmain, which also runs AntPool, the second largest mining pool in the world, controlling some 20 percent of total hash power. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Wu said he expects the Bitcoin price to rise as a result of the halving.

“Bitcoin's monetary policy is not perfect but it delivers on its promise. Delivering promise is very difficult for a monetary bureau or a central bank,” Wu said. “I believe the halving will have a very positive impact as the new supply will be much less than before. Logical analysis does not necessarily lead to a doubling-of-price conclusion but I do see the anticipation of the market having a positive impact on the price.”

Mu, CMO at Chinese mining pool and wallet service HaoBTC, shared Wu's optimism. Mu, who's HaoBTC accounts for some 3 percent of total hash power, agreed that Bitcoin's limited supply is a major selling point for the cryptographic currency and believes the future for the mining landscape is generally bright.

Mu said:

“A major factor that got me attracted to Bitcoin is the inflexibility of its monetary supply. The finite supply and halving-every-four-years scheme led me to believe that it was less subject to human fiddling, at least not controlled by a small group of political elites to the same extent as most fiat currencies in today's world.”

He added:

“I recently spent a couple weeks in western China, mostly Sichuan and Xinjiang. I sense there is strong optimism, both based on what my own company is planning and what I saw others are doing. I haven’t heard anyone telling me that they are divesting because of the halving. Of course, I haven’t ‒ and couldn't have ‒ talked with everyone in the industry, so can’t eliminate the possibility that I missed the larger picture.”

Krohn, CFO and co-founder of major cloud mining service Genesis Mining, shared the general sense of optimism as well, although he was more skeptical of the assumption that the price will continue to rise as a result of the subsidy halving.

“The normal argument goes like this: Given constant demand for Bitcoin and the fact that the supply for Bitcoin is halving, the price should go up,” Krohn said. “While the argument is correct at the first glance, it neglects that the event is known to every participant and thus will be 'priced in.' Speculators will start buying Bitcoin before the event takes place and thus will anticipate the outcome. Some of the price increase we have seen since the end of May, might be attributed to that.”

Risks

Although general sentiment under the miners was positive, others have warned about risks relating to the halving. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong in particular, but also some Bitcoin Core developers and other experts are concerned the subsidy halving might cause some miners to shut down their machines due to a lack of revenue. 

This could, in turn, lead to a drop in hash rate which means confirmation times would increase. Given current network capacity, moreover, this might lead to increased network congestion as more blocks fill up. In a worst-case scenario, a potential resulting decrease in user experience might even lead to users selling their bitcoins, therefore pressing the price and miner revenue even further down ‒ which could lead to more miners shutting down their machines: a “death spiral.”

The miners Bitcoin Magazine spoke with did not consider this scenario very likely, however, and said they are not too concerned about it.

Genesis Mining's Krohn explained:

“We believe any drop in hash rate will be relatively small, like 10 to 25 percent. This is because electricity contracts are generally fixed for a longer period; if a contract doesn't run out before the end of the month, you won't stop mining before the end of the month. Likewise, the economics of mining mean that significant amounts of money is invested in hardware. Since people have been aware of the halving event, it would not make sense for them to invest in hardware in the last – say – 6 months if they're going to turn their equipment off. Yet, most of the hardware was indeed added in the last seven to eight months. Add to that, that most of the investments in the last year were done with a much lower Bitcoin price in mind. Even now, new hardware is available from manufacturers and the roll-out is in full swing. Comparable events, like the Litecoin halving of August 2015, showed little impact on the overall hash rate, too.”

Krohn specifically addresses the potential “death spiral” series of events:

“The general 'death spiral' argument is correct. Blocks may fill up due to a drop in hash rate. But since our expectation is that this drop will not be too big, we believe that any congestion will be limited. It certainly will cause some annoyance, but on the other hand, most market participants are aware of it and will not dump their bitcoin for that reason. Also, a difficulty adjustment will take place two or three weeks later, after which things will be back to normal.”

Palatinus, operator of Slush Pool (representing some 5 percent of total hash power) was not concerned either. Agreeing with other miners, he referred to the significant increase of Bitcoin's exchange rate over the past year as an indication that miners will be fine.

“I generally agree that the halving will not be a problem. I do believe any potential price increase because of it is already reflected in the current exchange rate. But if mining was profitable enough for miners on price levels slightly above $200 USD, which we saw less than a year ago, it will be profitable with the current price ‒ even after the halving.”

HaoBTC's Mu agreed there is nothing to worry about. If anything, he believes total hash rate will continue to rise as it has done significantly over the past months.

Mu:

“During my trip in Western China, I saw a several new mines under construction. Also recently, I got contacted by a few professional miners outside China to help locate cheap power in China. So, based on my personal experience, I doubt that the hash rate will drop at all, if not grow substantially with major manufacturers poised to release new miners powered by more effective chips.”",Technical,0.6908
2016/7/7,BTCC and HaoBTC Dismiss Rumors of Hard Fork Threat by Chinese Bitcoin Miners,"Late last week, a post on Chinese Bitcoin community website 8btc gained a lot of attention in certain English-language Bitcoin circles, particularly the subreddit /r/btc. The post stated that Chinese Bitcoin miners should band together and push for a hard-forking change to the Bitcoin protocol via a switch in software from Bitcoin Core to Bitcoin Classic.

There has been some confusion in the days after the original “Terminator Plan” was posted on 8btc, as some in the Bitcoin community appear to believe this is a genuine plan agreed upon by Bitcoin miners in China. Bitcoin Magazine has reached out to two Bitcoin mining pools in China, and both have distanced themselves from the plan.

The Numbers Don’t Add Up

When looking over the Terminator Plan, one of the obvious issues with the letter is that the numbers simply don’t add up. The plan would supposedly involve greater than 75 percent of the hashrate coming together to support Bitcoin Classic, but roughly 20 percent of the network (represented by BTCC and BitFury) have made their support for Bitcoin Core rather clear over the past few months. This means that nearly every other Bitcoin mining pool or miner ‒ even those outside of China ‒ would have to be involved in the Terminator Plan for it to be real.

“Of course the math doesn’t add up because the plan isn’t real,” said BTCC COO Samson Mow. “Towards the bottom of the 8btc post it does say, ‘This is a suggestion to mining pools.’ Just because something is posted in Chinese on a Chinese forum it doesn’t mean it’s true or that you’re going to get an accurate understanding via Google Translate,” he continued.

At least one media outlet even questioned whether BTCC’s level of support for Bitcoin Core may be on the decline but Mow was quick to dismiss this theory via Twitter:

“As long as BTCC is operating Bitcoin exchanges and a Bitcoin mining pool, it’s not possible that we’d support a plan to compromise Bitcoin’s security or to hijack the development of the protocol,” Mow explained. “Plus, the basis of the Terminator Plan is to replace Core with Classic. That’s just plain ridiculous.”

HaoBTC Still Supports Bitcoin Core, but Not Unconditionally

In addition to Mow, Bitcoin Magazine also reached out to Eric Mu, who runs marketing and strategy for HaoBTC. Mu was perplexed by the reaction to the 8btc post from the English-speaking Bitcoin community, partially due to the fact that the author of the post was anonymous.

“As far as I know, the company never discussed the Terminator Plan, publicly or privately,” Mu said when asked if HaoBTC has discussed this plan in the past. “When I first read the article, my impression was that author was a bit tongue-in-cheek, but the views he expressed echoed a sentiment that has been around for some time.”

Mu then clarified HaoBTC’s stance on the block size debate:

“HaoBTC's official stance has been consistent and was clearly expressed in the Hong Kong Consensus. Our support of Core over its alternatives is based on our commitment to the [Hong Kong] Consensus and dedication to building a governance model based on open dialogue between the industry and the development community, thus it is not unconditional.”

Although parts of the Bitcoin community would like to see the mining community have a bigger role in protocol development decisions, Mu revealed some of the reasons miners are hesitant to take a stand. “Some are wary of the current Core developers all quitting in the Mike Hearn fashion, which might lead to a disastrous outcome; some simply don't want the rest of the world to perceive Bitcoin as being controlled by the Chinese, a narrative that has gained currency in the media as demonstrated by the recent New York Times article,” explained Mu.

Antpool Doesn’t Dismiss the Rumors

One of the oddest aspects of this story is that Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu has been unwilling to dismiss the rumors surrounding the Terminator Plan. When asked about the issue on Twitter, Wu repeatedly responded by saying there is no censorship on Chinese forums and ideas are allowed to be discussed freely ‒ an obvious slight at the /r/Bitcoin subreddit where moderation is sometimes perceived to be heavy.

HaoBTC has also sent out their own tweet regarding the Terminator Plan without offering any clarification (at the time of publication of this article):

This means that the sensational “25 bitcoin”-era is coming to an end. Since to the last halving almost four years ago, Bitcoin’s experienced spectacular growth, in every conceivable way.

2016/7/12,Why Do Some Bitcoin Mining Pools Mine Empty Blocks?,"Blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain have a maximum size of 1 MB. Proof of work difficulty is calibrated so 1 block is created every 10 minutes. It is generally accepted a miner would want to maximise the number of transactions it includes in a block as it collects the transaction fees. Logically, with the growing popularity of Bitcoin, the average block size is getting closer to its limit.



In this environment, it is surprising to see a number of empty blocks being mined. An empty block is not entirely empty, it has 1 transaction : the coinbase transaction which allocates the mining reward to the miner (12.5 bitcoins at the time of writing). It is important to know, that empty blocks are not easier, cheaper or quicker to mine than full blocks. The ratio of empty blocks varies considerably from one mining pool to the other. For instance, Bitfury, BitClub Network and Kano CKPool do not mine empty blocks.


Why are there empty blocks?
When a mining pool receives a new block from a competitor, it needs to perform a few actions: download the full block, validate its transactions and define a new block to mine on. During this - albeit short -interval, so as not to waste hashing power, they start mining a new block. Only the coinbase transaction is included, so the previous block does not invalidate theirs with a duplicate transaction.

This validationless mining (or SPV mining) phenomenon can be seen on the Kaiko blockchain page, with empty blocks being mined just after a normal block, when the mempool is far from empty.

The number of empty blocks is dropping

The share of empty blocks has fallen across the board over the past few months, although the timing has not been quite the same for all pools. The main theory behind this is the improvements made in the mining software, especially Bitcoin Core 0.12, which reduces the time between the validation of a block mined by another pool and the mining of a new non empty block

These improvements included (but were not limited to):

Improvement which allowed for pre calculation of some of the work required for a miner to validate all the transactions in the block (rather than doing it at block creation time)
Relay Network configuration improvements which includes a technically simplified (and quicker) prioritisation of transactions to help miners decide which transactions to include in a block
Bitcoin Core GetBlockTemplate - improvement by which the individual miner requests the composition of the block to mine- optimizations. More details are available here: https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/02/23/release-0.12.0/
Is it bad?
The whole point of the Bitcoin network is to process transactions. Therefore, empty blocks are often criticised as “bad behaviour” as creating very little value for the network by accelerating disinflation and stealing from “honest” miners.

However, it can also be considered as counter-balancing the centralisation tendency of the network: a pool which wins a block can start mining the next block immediately since they already know which transactions were included in the block. Whereas other miners first have to download the transactions, and then generate a new block which doesn’t include any of them. The ability to mine with just the header, could be considered to limit the benefits of centralisation.

Technically, it could be easily prevented by including, for example, a hash of the current coinbase concatenated with all the previous transactions in the block header. The recent fall in the number of empty blocks shows that the issue can be contained through improvements in the protocol which make mining empty blocks less interesting. Additionally, the gradual decrease of the block reward and the increased reliance on transaction fees will likely make mining empty blocks unprofitable over time.",Technical,-0.9961
2016/7/29,"How Falcon, FIBRE and the Fast Relay Network Speed Up Bitcoin Block Propagation (Part 2)","Bitcoin is designed as a peer-to-peer network, where nodes randomly connect to other nodes. Transactions and blocks are transmitted over this network by these nodes, until each has received all. This works quite well, as the distributed model makes Bitcoin relatively censorship-resistant; there is no central point of control to shut down or pressure into compliance.

But it also has a significant downside: The peer-to-peer network is relatively slow. As such, miners (and pools) sometimes waste hash power mining on top of an old block while a newer block is finding its way through the network. Transmission delay, therefore, benefits pooled mining as well as geographic clustering of miners, incentivizing a more centralized mining topology. This is generally considered one of the bottlenecks for scalability, as larger blocks (which can include more transactions) propagate even more slowly.

Over the past years, therefore, several projects have been in development to increase the speed of block propagation. These projects focus on roughly two main issues: block compression to limit the amount of data that needs to be propagated over the network, and relay speed to cut the time it takes for blocks to propagate.

This two-part series provides an overview of these projects. Part 1 covered block compression. Part 2 will examine ways of speeding up the network.

Fast Relay Network (AKA Matt Corallo's Relay Network)

The Fast Relay Network, also known as Matt Corallo's Relay Network, is a relatively straightforward relay network setup by Corallo, and has existed for some years. The Fast Relay Network consists of nine nodes, distributed strategically around the globe. Designed as a hub-and-spoke model, miners can connect to the relay node closest to them to send and receive blocks over this network. This is significantly faster than Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network.

The main downside of the Fast Relay Network is that it's relatively centralized: Corallo controls it. And while the software is open source, no one else has set up a similar open relay network so far. (Though mining pools do have similar — but closed — setups among themselves, and typically for “internal” use among their own nodes.)

For more details, see Bitcoin Magazine's earlier article on the Fast Relay Network.

Falcon

As blocks are transferred over Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network, they are really transmitted in several IP-packets. Each node on the network receives each packet, and reconstructs blocks from the data in these different packets. Once the block is reconstructed and considered valid, nodes forward the block to other nodes. Again, of course, in different packets.

To speed this process up, Cornell University researchers Soumya Basu, Ittay Eyal and Emin Gün Sirer are developing the Falcon relay network. Falcon uses a technique called “cut-through routing,” where nodes don't wait to receive all packages to forward them. Instead, they forward each package as soon as they receive it, while initially checking only the block header. They reconstruct the block in the meantime, as the rest of the packages arrive.

This solution does have one disadvantage: Nodes can validate a full block only after they have received all required packages. As such, there's a small risk of a dishonest miner transmitting invalid packages all across the network, wasting competitor resources.

To solve this, the Falcon network operates with gatekeepers: the Cornell University team. As such, the Falcon network itself isn't entirely decentralized; the idea is that it decentralizes Bitcoin's overall network topology through diversity.

FIBRE

As noted, blocks on the Bitcoin network are really transmitted in several IP-packets. Unfortunately, package-loss is a significant bottleneck for propagation speed; even on relay networks. While it doesn’t necessarily happen very often, packet-loss can cause spikes in transmission-time, as nodes need to re-communicate data.

FIBRE (Fast Internet Bitcoin Relay Engine), also developed by Corallo, is a re-designed relay-protocol. As perhaps its most interesting solution, it is built on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). This is an alternative to the far more common TCP internet protocol, and currently mostly used for Voice over IP (Skype) and gaming. As an important differentiator from all the above protocols, UDP allows FIBRE to use a nifty trick known as Forward Error Correction (FEC). This lets nodes reconstruct all of the transmitted data even if some of it got lost on the way.

And: FIBRE is specifically designed for Compact Blocks; the innovation discussed in Part 1 of this series. The combination of FIBRE with Compact Blocks, as statistics collected by Corallo show, make FIBRE nearly as fast as the speed of light.

Lastly, FIBRE is designed to be a more decentralized alternative to other relay networks. Specifically, as a key feature of FIBRE, it's designed as a sort of “add on” for Bitcoin Core, so anyone who runs a node should be able set up his or her own network.",Technical,-0.9911
2016/8/2,"Articles › Bitcoin Miners and Developers Meet in California to ""Improve Communications""","What was thought by some to be a secret meeting of Bitcoin miners and Bitcoin Core developers turned out to look more like a company retreat than anything else, according to those in attendance.

Although there have been some public statements of disagreement between the mining and development communities in Bitcoin, representatives from the two groups met in California over the weekend to improve communications and strengthen their business and personal relationships.

“Over the last few days, some Bitcoin developers and miners got together for a social gathering to improve communication, friendship, and to do some California sightseeing,” notes a statement released by the attendees and shared with Bitcoin Magazine.

Although some aspects of the gathering in California will be made public, a full list of attendees will not be available.

A Weekend of Team Building

The scaling debate was clearly discussed over the course of the meetup in California, but these talks were said to be mostly informal. There was no intention to come to a sort of agreement like the one that was made in Hong Kong earlier this year. The goal was to strengthen the unity between these two segments of the Bitcoin ecosystem.

While obvious topics, such as mining decentralization and progress for hard and soft forks, were discussed over the past few days, the participants in the gathering also had an open discussion with Professor Dan Boneh at Stanford and answered questions from Google employees at their campus.

“We think that Bitcoin's strength comes from the consensus of its participants,” said those who attended the gathering via a group statement. “Many of us plan to attend Scaling Bitcoin 3 in Milan, Italy, and everyone would like to continue with gatherings like these and others in the future with all parts of the Bitcoin ecosystem. We hope to be releasing notes in the near future for parts of the community that were not attending.”

A Trip to Stanford

A transcript of Boneh’s cryptography talk at Stanford has already been made available by LedgerX Bitcoin Developer Bryan Bishop. During the presentation, Boneh discussed a private form of proof-of-solvency for Bitcoin custodians and exchanges. According to Boneh, this scheme would allow exchanges to prove their solvency without revealing their Bitcoin addresses, total holdings or liabilities, or any information about their customers.

“It's a chicken-egg problem. Customers aren't demanding it, so ... someone needs to be the first one to step up and do it,” added Boneh. The method of proving solvency is outlined in a paper from last year, which lists Boneh as a co-author.

In addition to proof-of-solvency, Boneh discussed Schnorr signatures and other possible improvements for Bitcoin.

Why Weren’t Exchanges and Wallet Providers Invited?

One of the common questions among those who were not invited to the gathering has been related to the lack of participation from exchanges and wallet providers. Some members of the community expressed concerns over a perceived lack of transparency and sense of exclusion.

“Wow. Bitcoin governance collapses into closed technocratic control,” tweeted Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire.

Samson Mow from BTCC was in attendance, but the company is one of the few that operates both an exchange and as a mining pool.

“The main purpose was to improve communications between miners and Bitcoin Core developers,” Bitcoin Core contributor Eric Lombrozo told Bitcoin Magazine. “It's harder to do that with a very large group — especially across the cultural and language barrier.”

Lombrozo sees value in these types of events. “In-person meetings help build relationships.” he said.

Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell, who also attended the gathering, echoed this sentiment. “I thought it was really positive — and good to meet up with people face to face that I'd only talked with in email before,” he said in a post on bitcointalk.org.

“The Bitcoin industry seriously needs better communication — especially crossing language and cultural barriers — rather than hot comments on social media,” Maxwell said. “Improved communication will lead to fewer potential avenues for miscommunication and better cooperation in the future.”",Technical,0.4404
2016/8/8,Bitcoin Core Devs Reach Out to Coders With Month-Long Coding Classes,"Chaincode Labs developers Alex Morcos and Suhas Daftuar, and Blockstream developer Matt Corallo — three regular Bitcoin Core contributors ― will organize a month-long Bitcoin coding class at the Chaincode Labs offices in New York starting September 12. During this “Bitcoin Hacker Residency,” they will assist and mentor about half a dozen developers, with the goal of enabling them to contribute to Bitcoin on a protocol-level or to related projects such as FIBRE or the Lightning Network.

Bitcoin’s development community, and in particular the part of it that focuses on low-level protocol improvement, consists of a relatively small group of developers. Most of them work on Bitcoin Core, and they joined the project roughly between 2011 and 2013. Since then, not many newcomers have started contributing — with Morcos and Daftuar as some notable exceptions. Along with Corallo, they believe this is likely in part because the learning curve to contribute meaningfully has become quite steep.

Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Corallo explained:

“I think there is a lot of understandable feelings of not wanting to contribute to Bitcoin Core and protocol-level development because 'nothing in Bitcoin is new again.’ When you come into Bitcoin as a developer, you're gonna first suggest the same 100 changes everyone else did the first year. And it doesn't usually feel great to be constantly told your ideas are not useful — especially when you're communicating over text, and you don’t see that people are trying to help. You just see a bunch of people who keep telling you you're wrong.”

The hacker residency is intended for established developers, preferably with experience in Bitcoin-related projects, who are not on a protocol-level competency yet. Corallo believes the month-long coding class should allow these developers to cross the gap and be able to contribute meaningfully to Bitcoin Core or related projects, if they want to.

“There are a ton of Bitcoin developers who have never contributed to Bitcoin Core, or to low protocol development — lots of them because they feel ill-equipped to do so — for instance because the idea of going through rigorous review like we have to do sounds really daunting. So we're looking for those people to really learn how that works, and come to think about the issues that Bitcoin Core developers focus all day on,” Corallo said.

The hacker residency will have a hands-on approach, where participating developers mostly learn by doing. The goal is to put developers in a supportive environment where they can contribute to Bitcoin Core or other Bitcoin-related projects, with people around to help them where necessary. Additionally, there will be a few talks about Bitcoin's design elements and ways to think about Bitcoin protocol engineering.

The hacker residency should not be considered a recruitment scheme, however; the class is offered entirely on a no-strings-attached basis. Participating in the hacker residency is free, but availability is limited. Developers interested in joining can apply by sending an overview of their background as well as some ideas of Bitcoin projects they find exciting to fall16residency@chaincode.com.",Technical,0.0258
2016/8/12,"Mimblewimble: How a Stripped-Down Version of Bitcoin Could Improve Privacy, Fungibility and Scalability All at Once","All (full) Bitcoin nodes verify all transactions on the network. This allows the system to be entirely trustless and decentralized, but also presents significant drawbacks. Privacy and fungibility are at odds, because public transactions allow anyone to trace the flow of bitcoins over the blockchain. Meanwhile, verifying a growing number of transactions adds to the cost of running a node, which could be a centralizing force.

But perhaps these drawbacks can be tackled. Last week, a new white paper was somewhat mysteriously dropped on a Bitcoin research channel, written by the pseudonymous author “Tom Elvis Jedusor” (Voldemort’s real name in the French edition of the Harry Potter novels). His proposal “Mimblewimble” — a reference to a Harry Potter spell — presents a radical slimming-down of the Bitcoin protocol that could not only dramatically increase privacy and fungibility, but also present significantly more scalability than Bitcoin’s current blockchain architecture.

Mimblewimble may just hit two giant birds with one stone. Here’s how.

Hiding Amounts

Mimblewimble is based on some of Bitcoin’s familiar privacy features. One of these is Confidential Transactions, which was mostly developed by Bitcoin Core and Blockstream developer Gregory Maxwell and is currently deployed on Blockstream’s Elements Alpha sidechain.

Confidential Transactions lets senders encrypt the bitcoin amounts in transactions with random strings of numbers called “blinding factors.” This process works because transactions also include information with which (only) receivers can decrypt the amounts. And, by utilizing a cryptographic trick called the Pedersen Commitment, anyone else can still perform math on the encrypted amounts. Specifically, Bitcoin nodes can subtract the encrypted amounts on the sending side of transactions (“inputs”) from the encrypted amounts on the receiving side of transactions (“outputs”). If the two sides cancel out to zero, it means the combined inputs and the combined outputs are equal, and no bitcoins were created out of thin air.

Mimblewimble sort of turns this trick on its head as the receiver of a transaction generates the blinding factor. This is important because as one of the main deviations from the current Bitcoin protocol, this blinding factor is effectively used to prove ownership of the (blinded) bitcoins — private keys are no longer in play at all. (Nor are public keys or addresses.)

Proving ownership of the blinding factor itself revolves around a series of cryptographic tricks that are Mimblewimble’s closest equivalent to Bitcoin’s cryptographic signatures, though the full extent of these tricks is beyond the scope of this article.

It is important to note, however, that part of these mathematical maneuvers includes the introduction of a sort of “dummy output.” Where transaction outputs normally indicate under what conditions the receiver of a transaction may later spend the bitcoins, these dummy outputs are really just random numbers to ensure that only the person who generated the blinding factor can spend the bitcoins in the real outputs.

Combining Transactions

Another familiar Bitcoin trick that inspired Mimblewimble is CoinJoin, first proposed by (again) Maxwell.

CoinJoin allows users to bundle their transactions into one bigger transaction, scrambling all inputs (the “from” part of a transaction), as well as all outputs (the “to” part). This potentially obfuscates which bitcoins were sent from which address to which address, and breaks the assumption that all inputs belong to the same user.

Mimblewimble (and a fix by Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra) takes this concept a bit further and completely gets rid of transactions once a new block is created. Instead of transactions, Mimblewimble blocks mainly consist of three lists: a list of new inputs (referring to old outputs), a list of new outputs and a list of cryptographic signatures created with the aforementioned dummy outputs.

Utilizing the Pedersen Commitment scheme, all nodes can use the input list and the output list, and verify that no bitcoins were created out of thin air. The dummy output signatures, meanwhile, prove that all individual transactions must have been valid. Acting rather like “stamps of approval,” these dummy output signatures only add up mathematically if the whole transaction itself does.

And since it is never revealed which inputs spent bitcoins to which outputs exactly, nor how many bitcoins were actually spent, no trace of funds can be established at all. As such, Mimblewimble presents a tremendous boon for privacy and fungibility.

Scalability

And then there’s the scalability improvement.

Currently, many transactions on the Bitcoin network are linked. Spending a bitcoin really takes an output from a previous transaction and turns it into an input of a new transaction. This means that if an older transaction is invalid, a newer transaction that relies on the older transaction is invalid, too. So to be able to validate all transactions on the Bitcoin network, nodes must know all transactions that ever took place; the entire blockchain. (That’s currently some 80 gigabytes worth.)

But with Mimblewimble there is no longer really such a thing as a transaction history per coin. Each coin does have a specific block in which it was first created. But from then on, its value simply becomes part of the combined Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) set, which defines all outputs that store coins and could potentially be spent at any time.

This means that in order to verify new transactions, nodes no longer need to care about previous transactions. All they need to care about is that the specific outputs used are valid.

With even more clever math, nodes can establish the validity of outputs relatively easily. They just need the block headers of all blocks (a sort of index of blocks without all transaction data) and the aforementioned dummy output signatures: both relatively compact data-sets. All other transaction data — almost the entire blockchain — can be safely discarded.

The benefit compared to other anonymizing techniques is substantial. If Confidential Transactions and CoinJoin had been used in Bitcoin from day one, nodes would currently require more than a terabyte of data to operate. With Mimblewimble, they would need closer to 120 gigabytes. And perhaps even more interesting: where the blockchain necessarily has to grow over time, the required Mimblewimble dataset does not, and can actually shrink if more bitcoins are stored in fewer outputs.

Compatibility

Now for the bad news. Mimblewimble, in its current form, is not very compatible with the Bitcoin protocol. This is mainly because for Mimblewimble to work, script must be purged from transactions. As such, there would no longer be room for a whole set of Bitcoin features, like time-locked transactions (used for the Lightning Network among other things), atomic swaps (for cross-blockchain interoperability), and more.

But that doesn’t make Mimblewimble useless. Mimblewimble may, for instance, be the perfect fit for a privacy-focused sidechain. Bitcoin users could lock their bitcoins into a specific output on the Bitcoin blockchain and “move” their coins to the Mimblewimble chain. On this sidechain, users could transact freely and privately for as long as they want, until the new owner decides to “move” the funds back to the Bitcoin blockchain by unlocking the original output.

Due to the efficiency offered by Mimblewimble’s sidechain, the added burden of maintaining it would be very manageable. Moreover, it could potentially unload much data from the Bitcoin blockchain, increasing scalability even for those who don’t use Mimblewimble at all. Where sidechains are typically not considered a scaling solution, Mimblewimble offers one.",Technical,0.4404
2016/8/22,What’s New in Bitcoin Core 0.13.0?,"Bitcoin Core 0.13.0, the thirteenth generation of Bitcoin's reference client as first launched by Satoshi Nakamoto almost eight years ago, has now been tagged for release. This is one of the final steps in the software release process and initiates the Gitian build process.

Bitcoin Core 0.13.0 was developed by some 100 contributors over a period of about five months. And while much of the development effort over this time has also been focused on Segregated Witness, which will be activated only in a future minor release of the software, Bitcoin Core 0.13.0 includes about a dozen notable improvements compared to Bitcoin Core 0.12.0.

These are the most important changes.

Child Pays for Parent

The number of transactions on the Bitcoin network has been steadily growing over time. As a result, more blocks have been filling up, and miners typically charge higher fees to include transactions into blocks. Transactions that don't include sufficient fees usually take longer to confirm, or perhaps even never confirm at all. This has proved to be somewhat problematic, especially in periods where so-called “stress tests” were conducted on the network, with spikes in the total number of transactions on the network and substantial transaction delays.

Individual users can solve this problem by including a higher fee in their transactions, incentivizing miners to prioritize these transactions. This is possible even after a transaction is sent, using Opt-in Replace-by-Fee (RBF); however, not many wallets include this option yet. Additionally, RBF is only an option for the sender of a transaction. Up till now, the receiver had no way to bump the fee for an incoming transaction to speed up confirmation.

This problem is effectively solved with a trick called “Child Pays for Parent” (CPFP). CPFP is a policy used by miners to select which transactions to include in blocks. With CPFP, miners don't necessarily pick the highest paying (and valid) transactions, but instead pick the most profitable set of transactions. In other words: they will select a low-fee transaction if a subsequent transaction that relies on the low-fee transaction offers a high enough fee to compensate. The miner will include both at the same time.

In practice, this means that the receiver of a low-fee transaction can “attach” a high-fee transaction, spending the same coins to himself. Incentivized by the new, high-fee transaction, a miner will include the set of transactions. As such, the receiver won't have to wait as long for a confirmation, while the miner can increase his income.

Compact Block Support

Bitcoin's peer-to-peer protocol is currently somewhat inefficient. Nodes send each other most transaction data twice: once as a transaction as it is initially sent over the network, and once as part of a block when the transaction is confirmed.

This has some disadvantages. For one, sending transaction data twice requires more bandwidth than it really should, which adds to the cost of running Bitcoin Core. Second, and perhaps more importantly, forwarding new blocks to several peers at the same time can cause significant outbound bandwidth spikes. This potentially disrupts internet-usage each time a new block is found, which is potentially annoying for users. And perhaps, more importantly, it can slow down block propagation over the network as well. Slow block propagation can, in turn, favor bigger mining pools, thereby incentivizing a more centralized mining landscape.

Compact Blocks (BIP 152), developed by Bitcoin Core and Blockstream developer Matt Corallo, are designed to decrease excess data-transmission. When a new block is found, nodes initially only communicate very compact hashes of transaction data. As nodes have already received the full transaction data when it was originally sent over the network, they can use these hashes to figure out which transactions are included in the block and reconstruct the block themselves.

This trick does not always work out perfectly, however. If a node did not yet receive the initial transaction before receiving the hashes, that node, of course, can't select the transaction. Additionally, in rare cases a wrong transaction may hash into a right hash, fooling the node into believing it received the right transaction until it tries to reconstruct the block and finds it doesn't add up.

In both these cases of failure, the node simply requests the specific transaction data after all. Even with only some complete transactions in them, Compact Blocks will transmit over the network much faster, and require significantly less bandwidth.

Hierarchical Deterministic Key Generation

Up till now, Bitcoin Core generated a new and completely random public and private key pair for each new Bitcoin address. While this is important for security and privacy reasons, it can also be a bit of a burden for users. In order to secure all private keys against loss, they need to make regular backups.

Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Key Generation (BIP 32), a cryptographic trick developed throughout 2012 and 2013 by Bitcoin Core developers Gregory Maxwell and Dr. Pieter Wuille, and Armory-developer Alan Reiner, solves this problem. With HD key generation, Bitcoin Core creates a completely new key pair for each new address, but all these keys are derived from a single, 12-word seed. As long as users remember this 12-word seed, they can re-generate all private keys and access all their funds.

It should be noted that HD Key Generation is not a new feature in the Bitcoin world. Many wallets already included the option for several years. It just never existed in Bitcoin's reference client — until now.

Performance & Security

And of course, Bitcoin Core 0.13.0 introduces a significant list of performance and security upgrades. The full extent of these improvements is beyond the scope of this article (see Bitcoin Core 0.13.0's release notes for all the details), but in short...

The database cache memory has been increased, which allows nodes to speed up transaction validation and more. The Bitcoin command line tool now allows users to type passphrases and other sensitive information interactively, improving security by not storing this information in plain text. The software is updated to use C++11 and Python 3, newer versions of the programming languages, that allow for more powerful features. ARM (a specific microprocessor architecture) binaries for Linux are now part of the release, so users don’t have to compile this for themselves. Data concerning which transactions in a mempool rely on each other (as utilized with CPFP) can be communicated to external programs. Nodes on the network can request to receive only transactions that meet a certain fee threshold to prevent DoS attacks. And, lastly, there have been a lot of low-level improvements to the peer-to-peer, remote procedure call, and messaging system (ZMQ) protocols.

2016/9/22,Roger Ver Is Still Determined to Increase the Bitcoin Block Size Limit via a Hard Fork,"Two attempts to increase Bitcoin’s block size limit via hard forks — Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic — have failed to gain much support in terms of network hashrate, but early bitcoin advocate and angel investor Roger Ver is not giving up on the cause. Ver is currently testing a new mining pool at Bitcoin.com, and he’s put together a new development team to work on an alternative to Bitcoin Core, the reference implementation of the Bitcoin protocol.

Bitcoin Magazine recently reached out to Ver to get more details on his plan to increase the block size limit by way of a hard fork.

A Work-in-Progress

According to Ver, his plan for hard forking Bitcoin is still a work-in-progress. “I still have lots more research and thinking to do,” he told Bitcoin Magazine. “The first step is to actually have our pool up and running. I think you will see our first block mined on the network this coming week.”

The Bitcoin.com mining pool mined its first block a few days after Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Ver.

The current mining pool software is running Bitcoin Unlimited, but Ver says a specific plan for increasing the Bitcoin block size has not been chosen at this time. With Bitcoin Unlimited, nodes are able to choose the maximum size of the blocks they create and accept as valid. According to one Bitcoin.com mining pool developer, the pool will mine 1 megabyte blocks and accept blocks as large as 16 megabytes for now.

When  asked about an activation threshold for a hard fork, Ver seemed to distance himself from the idea of increasing the block size limit without a large amount of support signaled by miners on the network. “Ultimately the threshold is always 51 percent, but we would also likely support something higher in order to try to maintain more cohesiveness with the community,” he said.

Ver is unable to publicly disclose the members of his alternative Bitcoin development team at this time, although he recently stated during an episode of The Bitcoin Game that former Bitcoin Core lead maintainer Gavin Andresen is not on the team.

In terms of how much hashing power the pool will have on mainnet, Ver told Bitcoin Magazine, “We will start off with a very small amount on mainnet to test for a few blocks, and then grow quickly from there.”

Bitcoin Unlimited Forks Classic Off Testnet

Although the Bitcoin.com mining pool only recently went live on the mainnet, the pool has been operating on testnet for over a month. In fact, the Bitcoin.com mining pool forked Bitcoin Classic off of the testnet because Bitcoin Unlimited signals support for BIP 109 without actually implementing the full set of rules in that specific proposal.

“I would recommend reading the discussions that already took place on /r/btc about this,” said Ver when asked about this incident.

When Bitcoin Core contributor and Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell challenged Ver regarding the testnet fork and the “consensus inconsistencies between Bitcoin ‘Classic’ and other implementations are now causing Classic to reject the testnet chain with most work,” Ver pointed out, “We are testing on testnet. That’s what testnet is for.”

Bitcoin Unlimited has been promoted as production-ready software for at least half a year, which is one of the reasons why some Bitcoin Core contributors have been seeking further clarification on exactly what was being tested with Ver’s testnet mining pool.

“[Bitcoin Unlimited] and [Bitcoin] Classic both claim to support the same consensus rules (BIP109), but are diverged and will not share the same testnet anymore — the whole point of a consensus system is to come to consensus and [Bitcoin Unlimited] and [Bitcoin] Classic will reliably fail to do so on testnet,” commented Maxwell.

Bitcoin Unlimited developer Andrew Stone shared his views on the testnet fork in a blog post. “Bitcoin Unlimited's ‘excessive block’ and ‘excessive accept depth’ algorithm is not just an arbitrary choice — it’s the optimal choice rational software can make in an untrusted network,” he wrote. “In essence, it encourages the client's preferences to the extent that the client can do so, but then follows the majority when the client's preference is rejected.”

Scaling Bitcoin to Meet Customer Demand

In Ver’s opinion, the current 1 megabyte block size limit is preventing further adoption of Bitcoin as a digital cash system. “As someone who has 15 years of experience scaling enterprise networks before my involvement in Bitcoin, there is no doubt in my mind that the network can handle significantly larger than 2 megabytes blocks today,” he stated.

In fact, in the aforementioned interview on The Bitcoin Game, Ver claimed a block size limit of 20, 30, 40, or even 50 megabytes may be fine. A key clarification on this statement is that Ver does not believe excess block size would be used right away. “If the maximum block size today was set at 50 megabytes, the blocks wouldn’t be 50 megabytes,” he said. “The blocks would probably be about a megabyte-and-a-half — maybe two megabytes.”

In his comments to Bitcoin Magazine, Ver took this point further. “If there was no limit on the block size at all today, most blocks would likely be somewhere between 1.2 megabytes and 3 megabytes at the moment.”

In the past, Bitcoin Core contributors, such as Blockstream’s Mark Friedenbach, have argued that miners with better connections have an incentive to create bigger blocks. A miner could potentially stuff blocks full of transactions in order to gain a competitive advantage over their peers.

The key for Ver is to allow Bitcoin to scale in tandem with customer demand. He does not want to see potential users move away from Bitcoin due to its “lack of scalability today.”

“Sadly this is already happening on a large scale,” said Ver. “But the current [Bitcoin Core] development team doesn’t seem to realize this or care. Some of them were even openly advocating that people use credit cards instead of Bitcoin at a local Silicon Valley Meetup earlier this year.”

“I feel disturbed that some would consider it traitorous to mention that there exist systems other than Bitcoin that solve problems that Bitcoin doesn't,” said LedgerX Bitcoin developer and Bitcoin Core contributor Bryan Bishop when asked to comment on Ver’s reaction to the views expressed at Silicon Valley Meetup.

To some, the idea of using a decentralized system, such as Bitcoin, to buy a morning coffee at Starbucks doesn’t make much sense. There are tradeoffs when switching between centralized payment providers, such as Visa or Mastercard, and Bitcoin, and it’s unclear if there is much point to paying for a morning coffee on a system where the main value proposition is censorship resistance.

In 2013, there was a belief in the Bitcoin community that the average person would soon make all of their purchases via the peer-to-peer digital cash system, but the reality is — at least up to this point — that normal people don’t seem to have any desire to use Bitcoin for everyday purchases. Last year, Blockchain Capital Managing Partner Brock Pierce noted consumer adoption of Bitcoin could be a five– to twenty-year process.

Due to the 10-minute confirmation time associated with Bitcoin blocks, some say that the peer-to-peer digital cash system is not suitable for purchases at brick-and-mortar stores. The Bitcoin Core scaling roadmap includes layer-2 solutions, such as the Lightning Network, which allow for essentially instant confirmations at little to no cost. Others see zero-confirmation transactions as useful for physical retail stores, but these unconfirmed transactions also come with risks.

There are potential risks with the Lightning Network as well, but these risks can be mitigated via Maxwell’s timestop proposal, which is outlined in an updated version of the Lightning Network white paper.

In his final remarks, Ver made his long-term goals for bitcoin clear. “I’m interested in building a currency to rival the Dollar, the Euro, and the Yen,” he said. “Bitcoin will need to scale via many different ways in order to accomplish that.”",Technical,-0.0693
2016/10/7,Blockstream Completes Its First Lightning Transaction on Bitcoin Testnet,"Blockstream engineers Paul “Rusty” Russell and Dr. Christian Decker completed their first lightning transaction on Bitcoin’s testnet this week. The test transaction was made using the latest version of the Blockstream’s lightning prototype software, lightningd 0.5 and consisted of a digital purchase from a web-store.

Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine Decker said:

“This is a big milestone for us. It's the first time we have a channel setup on a real blockchain, with real latencies and block rates, and it's the first multi-hop transaction, where a payment for a digital good routes from one node to another through a third node.”

Making the Transaction

The highly anticipated lightning network is a proposed second-layer protocol to be rolled out on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain. Cleverly utilizing Bitcoin’s programmable elements (e.g., multi-signature and timelock) lightning users should be able to make a virtually unlimited number of off-chain transactions at low cost, potentially boosting Bitcoin’s micropayment-ability and overall scalability.

Several teams are currently working on different implementations of lightning software. Only last week, BitFury, Lightning Labs and ACINQ announced a successful test of proposed lightning routing system Flare, whereas a Lightning Labs developer had previously completed lightning transactions to himself. Blockchain, meanwhile, made lightning-style transactions on the alpha version of their Thunder network — though these are not yet trustless or secure.

Blockstream’s team is now the first to have conducted a successful and trustless transaction between two developers on Bitcoin’s testnet, which served as a “real” payment.

“We've spent over a year working on different parts of the protocol, and from a technical perspective, simply sewing them together isn't challenging,” Russell explained. “But it's easy for us geeks to miss the forest for the trees. For this transaction, I acted as an actual vendor, and Christian made an actual purchase. It involved infrastructure for creating invoices, giving them to the user, and checking if the user paid. We’re not just sending money point-to-point.”

Use of Testnet

Blockstream’s first transaction was done over testnet, a network specifically designed for testing new Bitcoin features. Testnet also has Segregated Witness deployed, which is required for the lightning network to function in a trustless and secure manner.

“This roll-out on testnet gives people who want to build on Lightning, like wallet developers, a chance to try it out and provide feedback on APIs, find bugs and more,” Russell said. “The change from testnet to the actual Bitcoin network is actually trivial in the code. The difference is that mistakes on the actual Bitcoin network cost real money.”

Creating a transaction with lightning is currently still very much a manual process. Most importantly, users need to open connections to other nodes’ IP addresses themselves. Decker did note, however, that he already wrote a patch to make peers announce their contact information, which will make this process easier.

“Our routing implementation relies on knowing every connection. That works for now, but obviously something more ambitious is being worked on, like BitFury’s Flare,” Russell said.

Additionally, onion routing for increased privacy is also in the works, and might even make it into the upcoming lightningd 0.5 release.

Scaling Implications

Lightning is often heralded as an important step for Bitcoin scalability, a topic that will be discussed at length during the upcoming Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Milan this weekend. In the days after the workshop, the different teams working on lightning will also come together to discuss compatibility of the different implementations.

“Unfortunately Mats Jerratsch of Blockchain’s Thunder Network won't be there, but it seems like every other implementer will,"" said Russell. ""We’ll go through the components of lightning and find the protocol we'd like to standardize on. Afterwards, we'll have to rework some of our own protocol, based on group decisions by the other lightning teams trying to arrive at an interoperable spec.”

Despite the successful test, Russell and Decker explained it will still take some time before lightning transactions will happen on top of the main Bitcoin network. Before lightning can be rolled out, Segregated Witness must first be activated, bugs in lightningd must be found and fixed, and it must be made more robust against misconfiguration. Then, the Blockstream team wants to create libraries to allow web developers to play with constructing their use-cases.

“We would like to build a small ecosystem on testnet and give people some hands-on experience before moving to mainnet,” said Decker.

2016/10/13,"The Next Step to Improve Bitcoin’s Flexibility, Scalability and Privacy Is Called MAST","The soon-to-be proposed Segregated Witness soft fork is set to extend Bitcoin’s potential in several ways. One potentially promising innovation enabled by “SegWit” is MAST, an abbreviation for Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees. While mainly designed to increase smart contract flexibility, MAST would increase scalability and privacy on the platform at the same time. The idea of MAST originates from Blockstream developer Russell O’Connor, Blockstream and Bitcoin Core developer, Dr. Pieter Wuille, and Bitcoin Core developer, Peter Todd. It was recently drafted into an initial Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) by Bitcoin Core developer Dr. Johnson Lau. Given its potential, MAST is surprisingly straightforward.

P2SH: A Primer

One part of the MAST puzzle is based on P2SH, which has been used in certain Bitcoin transactions for several years now.

All Bitcoin transactions in effect “lock bitcoins up” in outputs, which typically refer to Bitcoin addresses. These bitcoins are locked to be unlocked (and then locked again) in a later transaction; that’s how bitcoins effectively move from address to address.

This locking-up is really done with a script — a couple lines of code. For standard transactions, the script is included in the output and defines the requirement to spend bitcoins in a later transaction.

Most non-standard Bitcoin transactions, like multisig or CheckLockTimeVerify, use a slightly more complex scheme, called “P2SH” (which stands for Pay to Script Hash). With P2SH, bitcoins are still locked up in a script. But this script is itself not included in the transaction-output. Rather, the script is hashed; it’s scrambled and condensed into a short and seemingly random string of numbers. This string of numbers cannot be used to reproduce the original script. But with the original script, the string of numbers can be reproduced by simply hashing it again. The hash of the script is what’s included in the transaction-output.

To unlock a P2SH-output in a next transaction, it’s not sufficient to meet the requirements as defined in the script. After all, Bitcoin nodes on the network only know the hash of the script; not the actual script. These nodes, therefore, cannot verify that the requirements as defined in the script are met. They cannot confirm the transaction.

That’s why the next transaction, which spends the bitcoins, must include the whole script, as well as the requirements as defined in that script: the lock (script) itself, as well as the key (requirements) to unlock it.

By hashing the actual script, Bitcoin nodes can verify that the included script matches the script hash that was included in the previous output. If it matches, nodes know that the bitcoins were indeed locked into that specific script. Then they can verify that the requirements as defined in the script were met, and the transaction can be confirmed.

Merkle Trees: A Primer

The other part of the MAST puzzle is a cryptographic trick called Merkle tee.

A Merkle tree is basically a mathematical structure that hashes different sets of data into a single, compact hash: the Merkle root. Much like any other hash, this Merkle root cannot be used to recreate the data in the Merkle tree.

But Merkle trees offers a unique benefit. If any of the data in the Merkle tree is known, the Merkle root can be used to verify that that specific data is really somewhere in the Merkle tree — even if not all data in the Merkle tree is known.

As a simplified example, let’s say Alice made a Merkle tree by combining the data sets “123” and “456,” and that Merkle tree’s Merkle root turns out to be “789.” Alice then tells Bob that data package “123” is somewhere in this Merkle tree. Now, with just the Merkle root (“789”), Bob can verify that “123” is indeed included somewhere in the Merkle tree, even though he has no idea that “456” is in there as well. In fact, for all he knows, there could be thousands of data packages in the Merkle tree — and he couldn’t decipher any of them.

MAST: P2SH + Merkle Trees

MAST essentially merges the potential of P2SH with that offered by Merkle trees.

Instead of locking bitcoins up into a single script, with MAST the same bitcoins can be locked up in a series of different scripts. In other words, the same bitcoins can be locked up under a set of different and mutually exclusive conditions. (For example, requiring a cryptographic signature from only Alice, or a signature from Bob and Carol each, or a signature from only Carol after a certain amount of time has passed, and so forth.)

Whichever of these conditions is met in a (confirmed) transaction first determines how the bitcoins are spent. (If Alice is the first to sign a transaction spending the output, that transaction is valid. If Bob and Carol beat Alice to it, that’s the valid transaction. Or if a certain amount of time has passed and Carol is the first to sign, that is the valid one.)

Much like P2SH, all these different scripts are hashed. But this time, they’re combined into a Merkle tree. And it’s the Merkle root of this Merkle tree that’s included in a transaction-output, as a sort of ultimate lock.

Spending funds, then, resembles P2SH as well. To create a transaction that unlocks funds from the Merkle root, the whole script used must be included in the new transaction, as well as the requirement to unlock that script. (The lock and the key.)

But importantly: not all potential scripts (locks) must be included. Only the one that is actually used. (If Alice spends the funds first, she does not need to include the script that lets Bob and/or Carol spend the funds. In fact, Alice doesn’t even need to know that Bob and/or Carol could have also spent the funds.)

Bitcoin nodes can verify that the included script checks out by utilizing the Merkle tree trick. They use the Merkle root included in the output to check if the script used is really included in the Merkle tree. If it is, these nodes know that the included script checks out as one of the options to spend the bitcoins and can validate the new transaction.

Benefits

MAST improves Bitcoin in three main ways: it extends smart contract flexibility; improves scalability; and increases privacy.

The type of smart contract flexibility offered by MAST is not entirely new — there were already some “either/or” constructs possible with only P2SH. (Requiring a signature from only Alice, or a signature from Bob and Carol, etc.) But there is a currently protocol-imposed size limit on different options to prevent DoS attacks.

MAST extends smart contract flexibility since it removes any such limit. Whether there are two possible ways to spend bitcoins or 20 or 1000, it makes no difference to the network, only one script is included in the required transaction. This also enables new and complex possibilities, like 1-of-1000 multisig transactions, that would currently be too big. Or long lists of users that can spend specific bitcoins at different points in time.

Furthermore, these types of “either/or” constructs could, with P2SH, only be unlocked by ultimately publishing all of the scripts — not just the one used. This makes for big transactions, data-wise, and for expensive transactions, fee-wise. By only requiring users to include the script that is actually used in the end, MAST improves scalability. It reduces the amount of data that must be transmitted, validated and stored by all nodes on the network.

As an additional bonus, MAST improves privacy, again by the virtue of keeping unused scripts hidden forever. This could, for example, hide arbitrators from escrow transactions if they never come into play (because both trading parties use their 2-of-2 multisig-script, instead of the 2-of-3 version). Or it could hide never-used time-out safeguards from the public.

2016/10/18,"After Scaling Bitcoin, a Lightning Winter Release Is Now Within Reach","As last week’s Scaling Bitcoin workshops came to an end and its attendees returned home, the main task for 12 of Bitcoin’s prominent lightning network developers was really just starting. Last Monday and Tuesday, representatives from ACINQ, Amiko Pay,  BitFury, Blockstream, Lightning Labs and Purse gathered on the third story of a working space in the center of Milan. Sitting around a table filled with humming laptops and emptied out pizza boxes, the world’s first “lightning network summit” took place.

The specific task at hand was to establish interoperability between the different implementations of what is perhaps the most highly anticipated technology to be rolled out on the Bitcoin blockchain in the near future.

The Lightning Network

The lightning network was first proposed by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus “Tadge” Dryja well over a year ago. Utilizing Bitcoin’s basic programmable features — like multisig and time-locks — users can establish networked payment channels on top of Bitcoin, creating in effect an off-blockchain transaction layer leveraging Bitcoin’s security. This should allow for a near-infinite amount of trustless, instant and low-cost transactions with little added burden on the Bitcoin network and its users.

“The promise of this work is exceptional,” long-time Linux kernel developer Paul “Rusty” Russell wrote in a 2015 blog entry, after examining Poon and Dryja’s lightning network white paper.

It was this same Rusty Russell — now employed by Blockstream — that led important parts of the discussion in Milan. With his marker scribbling out proposed design specifications on a broad white sheet, the goal was to find common ground among the different teams. If all their implementations can connect and communicate with all the other implementations, utility of the lightning network will increase drastically.

“Unlike Bitcoin, where safety is having a gold standard implementation to minimize consensus surprises, lightning is strongest if we have multiple, independent implementations,” Russell explained to Bitcoin Magazine.

“We've seen a great deal of progress by the different groups experimenting and discovering problems and solutions. This is research and development in true open source style. We're now at the point where we've explored the landscape enough to make some decisions we feel will last. It’s the perfect time to come together and combine our powers into a single spec that we can all aim for.”

High Stakes

Ever since the idea for the lightning network was first proposed, the stakes have increased significantly. Whereas Poon and Dryja mostly hoped to realize instant confirmations and affordable micro-transactions, over the last year the payment layer was hurled into the midst of a raging scaling debate. As a result, the lightning network is now often considered a centerpiece of Bitcoin Core’s scalability road map.

But the proposal has been receiving increased scrutiny as well. Over the past months in particular, questions have been raised about the effectiveness of proposed routing solutions, potential Denial of Service (DoS) vectors and other failure modes, as well as usability of a system that requires users to lock up some of their funds.

To help overcome these kinds of challenges, non-lightning specific companies like the full-service Blockchain technology company, BitFury, and wallet provider and block explorer, Blockchain.info, have been investing resources to ensure the realization of the technology as well.

“As with many new technologies, there may be challenges in practice that we have not yet experienced in testing,” a representative from BitFury told Bitcoin Magazine, regarding potential difficulties ahead. “But we believe we are completely prepared for the implementation of the lightning network and are working tirelessly with our partners to ensure implementation goes smoothly.”

Scaling Bitcoin

The lightning network had already claimed center stage in the days prior to the summit at the Scaling Bitcoin conference itself. Three presentations on Saturday focused exclusively on the proposed scaling layer, while a workshop on lightning network routing continued later that afternoon.

At Scaling Bitcoin, Pavel Prikhodko, a developer with BitFury who has been researching routing solutions, presented what is generally considered to be the most advanced transaction routing solution so far: Flare. Initial tests of Flare were published by ACINQ a week earlier, with both ACINQ and BitFury professing to be happy with the results.

“Flare specifies how lightning network users may find routes to forward their payments through the network in a secure and decentralized manner,” said BitFury. “Flare is generally agreed upon in that it is a working solution for payment routing, and we are encouraged to see outside testing of the algorithm. We have found very favorable results in our internal tests, and are now working with the community to finalize the algorithm and to prepare it for medium-scale implementation.”

Lightning Labs' Olaoluwa “Laolu” Osuntokun, in a different presentation, explained how the lightning network can include the Sphinx algorithm for Tor-style onion-routing. With Sphinx, each peer on the network knows from which other peer it “received” a transaction, and to which peer that transaction must be “forwarded.” But peers don’t know if they’re the first step in the transaction chain, the last, or somewhere in between. They have no way of telling where a transaction originated or where it will end up. This would be a big boon for privacy, and is compatible with Flare as well as other routing solutions.

Lastly, Dryja proposed a solution to outsource important security measures. In the original lightning design, participants in lightning payment channels needed to monitor Bitcoin’s blockchain to check if a counterparty was trying to cheat them. With Dryja’s proposal, this task can be outsourced to a multitude of different peers. If even one of these peers notices the cheater — perhaps in exchange for a small fee — all funds are secured, and the cheater penalized. Furthermore, all this can be done while retaining full privacy, as the outsource service only gets to see an encrypted package.

Summit Conclusions

After two days of brainstorming, designing, discussion and some “horse trading,” as Russell put it, all teams managed to converge on a shared design. Over the next weeks, they will all plan to dig into their code to implement the Milan specification.

Emerging from Tuesday evening with a shared sense of optimism, the developers now believe there will be trustless lightning transactions on Bitcoin’s blockchain sooner than many expected.

“At the meeting and over the past months, Rusty and Christian Decker have been instrumental in contributing great work into low-level protocol design and specifications; without them, lightning would not be the same,” said Joseph Poon — who now works with Lightning Labs — of the participating developers. “Laolu and Tadge are doing critical fundamental work on the crypto design, and BitFury has been doing long-term thinking about payment routing. But really, there are too many people involved to mention. This is a growing team effort across many sectors of the Bitcoin ecosystem.”

Russell, too, said that he was impressed by the commitment of all the different teams as they came together to work on a shared specification.

“There's a … pervasive feeling of a group of people trying to push their brains for two days to reach a common goal. It's pretty intense. Exhausting, but there was so little bullshit,” he said. “Well, until Christian started playing Rebecca Black videos for some reason. That kind of ended the second day.”

Real-world Use

While there are still some open questions — especially regarding fee structures, countering DoS attacks, network topology and end-user experience — the teams expect early versions of the lightning network to be bootstrapped on top of the Bitcoin blockchain within months.

“A fully-functional lightning implementation without custodial trust would require a malleability fix — Segregated Witness — activated on main-net,” Poon explained. “As soon as that’s merged in, you should see users transacting on lightning.”

According to the BitFury representative, ""The BitFury Group is actively working on a lightning network wallet with a graphical user interface for desktop and mobile platforms, so users will be able to send lightning transactions to each other soon after the Bitcoin Blockchain is ready for it.”

From then on, real-world use of the technology can further inform developers to continue and improve the system. Since it’s still hard to predict how the lightning network will be used exactly, or by whom, the developers in Milan agreed that some of the potential problems are best solved as they occur.

Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Amiko Pay’s Corné Plooy explained that, as a second-layer solution, the lightning network is expected to be relatively flexible and future adjustments should be easy to implement.

“Technology-wise, lightning has it easier than Bitcoin,” Plooy said. “Bitcoin has this one-and-only blockchain, with its consensus rules that everybody has to agree on. But with lightning, the concept choices we made are probably — hopefully — not set in stone forever. We made an effort to not paint ourselves into a corner, and I think we are still in a flexible position, able to incorporate future developments as they occur.”

Now, the company is in the throes of a complementary project that has garnered the attention of entrepreneurs and developers throughout the Bitcoin community.

Bcoin, as it is affectionately called, is a newly developed JavaScript library that offers a new way to connect to the Bitcoin network. While Bcoin is not the first library in the high-level programming language, it is the first to include full node capabilities. In Bcoin — as opposed to another Bitcoin JavaScript library, bitcoinjs — tasks like blockchain verification don’t need to be offloaded to third parties. In other words, no other nodes need to be trusted to confirm the valid chain.

Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Purse CTO and Bcoin lead developer Christopher Jeffrey explained:

""When I was working at BitPay, we were looking for a ‘hackable’ Bitcoin back-end to do cool things with. I wanted access to lower level features than the Bitcoin Core API allowed, but a pull-request to make that possible was rejected, so I was left with few options. After I left BitPay, I turned to an old project I was a contributor to: Bcoin. Over the course of a year, I turned a simplified payment verification library into a full node library.”

Now, Bcoin is getting ready for “prime time,” as Purse will start running its service on top of it.

“Bcoin will be used as Purse's full node and wallet back-end,” Jeffrey explained. “It should be live within the next week. This means Bcoin will be responsible for securing actual money and will be battle-tested by us for anyone considering using it.""

A Viable Bitcoin Core Alternative?

While Bitcoin Core has been vetted over time, and for many still serves as the go-to standard, the code base can be a bit challenging to work with, even for experienced software engineers. As a result, only a small cadre of developers are fully conversant with it and actively contribute to its advancement.

Jeffrey’s efforts to create Bcoin should simplify some of the complexities associated with managing a large and rapidly growing merchant website.

""Bcoin is my answer to the Bitcoin development problem. I think it will be the right answer for a lot of people. JavaScript is a ubiquitous language: everyone is familiar with it and it runs everywhere, including the browser,” Jeffrey told Bitcoin Magazine.

But not everyone agrees that Bcoin is an enrichment to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Concerns about Bcoin have been raised among some other developers in the Bitcoin community.

Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd is perhaps the most outspoken critic. He told Bitcoin Magazine that rewriting the consensus code is a nice way to learn the protocol, but ultimately is a waste of money for a business.

“My views about this are typical of those of competent, experienced Bitcoin developers who believe that rewriting the consensus code and getting it right is spectacularly difficult, and no one has been successful at doing so,” Todd said. “Equally, the Satoshi Bitcoin code base is well optimized and very fast; you're not going to do better than that in JavaScript anyway.”

Todd went on to say that like it or not, consensus has incredibly strict requirements on compatibility. “You need 100% compatibility down to the tiniest minute details.” This, he says, is a unique requirement that simply doesn't exist in nearly all other projects. “If you're web-browser, no-one cares because layouts differ only by a few pixels. On the other hand, if your account balance and my account balance differ by even a single satoshi, then that's a huge problem that simply must be fixed. Otherwise it won't be clear who owns what money.”

Satoshi

Christopher Jeffrey acknowledged that a mentality around the infeasibility of a consensus protocol re-implementation has existed since the very early days of Bitcoin. Even Satoshi Nakamoto once predicted that an alternative implementation would act as a “menace to the network.”

Jeffrey says the goal isn’t to upstage Satoshi or to become problematic to the network, nor to establish a position in the block-size debate. Through the accelerated development of his new implementation, he hopes to debunk the notion that it is impossible to re-implement consensus code.

""Whoever Satoshi was, he was very smart, but he was not a programmer. He left us with an absolute mess of a project. That project has been further hacked together over the years to make it even more haphazard. The code is unreadable, the API is arbitrarily designed, and it's not very easy to fix all of that unless you start fresh. Consensus code is very difficult to re-implement, but not impossible. The criticisms of re-implemented consensus code do have some merit. That being said, most of the critics are too dismissive.""",Technical,-0.4939
2016/10/27,Segregated Witness Officially Introduced With Release of Bitcoin Core 0.13.1,"Today marks the release of Bitcoin Core version 0.13.1. This is the official introduction of Segregated Witness, the long-awaited centerpiece of Bitcoin Core’s scalability road map. Starting November 15, Bitcoin miners can signal support for the proposed protocol upgrade, which, if activated, enables a number of new features on the Bitcoin network as well as an effective block size limit increase.

According to Bitcoin Core developer and Ciphrex Co-CEO, Eric Lombrozo, “Segregated Witness is the biggest extension of the protocol to date.”

Segregated Witness

Segregated Witness is a proposed upgrade to the Bitcoin protocol first introduced by Bitcoin Core and Blockstream developer, Dr. Pieter Wuille, at the Scaling Bitcoin conference in Hong Kong in December of 2015. The technological innovation separates signature data from Bitcoin transactions. This has several advantages, including — but not limited to — a malleability fix, more flexible programmability, and an effective block size limit increase.

“It's the most significant improvement to the protocol to date, and lots of exciting innovations become possible as a result,” Lombrozo told Bitcoin Magazine. “We're going through a period of tremendous innovation  in Bitcoin — the greatest innovations since Bitcoin’s inception are taking place right now.”

Segregated Witness has been in the pipeline for almost year. Wuille started coding it in November 2015, and was joined by Lombrozo, Johnson Lau and several other Bitcoin Core developers in the following months. Counting almost 5,000 lines of code, Segregated Witness was completed last April.

Since that time, the proposed innovation has been subject to rigorous checks and analysis. Lombrozo explained:

“We’ve done a lot of review, and a lot of testing. We’ve had three dedicated Segregated Witness test networks, and it has been successfully running on Bitcoin’s main testnet since May. Additionally, compact blocks had to be developed and integrated in Bitcoin Core to mitigate latency and bandwidth issues. This was included in the latest version, 0.13.0.”

Activation

Segregated Witness is a proposed soft fork; a change that technically makes Bitcoin’s protocol rules more restrictive.

Activation will follow the standards as established by Bitcoin Improvement Improsal (BIP)9. This means that, within a single difficulty period of 2016 blocks (about two weeks), at least 95 percent of blocks must be mined by a miner that signals support for Segregated Witness. If this threshold is reached, the following difficulty period allows everyone who wants to upgrade the chance to do so. After that, Segregated Witness support is activated, and Segregated Witness transactions are accepted by Bitcoin miners.

Signaling will start on November 15. In the earliest possible scenario, this means that Segregated Witness could activate by mid-December. That seems somewhat unlikely at this time, however. A relatively new Chinese mining pool — ViaBTC — recently indicated it will not support a Segregated Witness soft fork. As ViaBTC currently controls about 9 percent of all hash power on the network, it could effectively block activation — assuming it remains above at least 5 percent.

Lombrozo indicated that the Bitcoin Core development team is not too worried, however.

“Changes to the consensus rules are hard by design,” he said. “In this case, I think the benefits vastly outweigh the risks, as Segregated Witness enables a bunch of new innovation in Bitcoin that will improve scalability and will allow for more use cases. My hope is that miners will appreciate these great benefits and will want to take advantage of this significant improvement to the protocol.”

If Segregated Witness is not supported by 95 percent of hash power by November 15, 2017, it can no longer activate. Until then, it’s unlikely that Bitcoin Core developers will present an alternative proposal, Lombrozo said.

“We've worked very hard to find a path forward that gives everyone in the ecosystem something they want,” said Lombrozo. “It's not always possible to please everyone, but we've made a great effort. We put this forward for the community. I hope the community appreciates our work and likes what we've done. At this point, it's in the community's hands to decide its fate.”

2016/11/17,Why ViaBTC Rejects SegWit Soft Fork in Favor of Block Size Hard Fork: Interview With Haipo Yang,"Set to offer an effective block size limit increase, a transaction malleability fix and more, Segregated Witness (SegWit) could soon go live on the Bitcoin network. Starting tonight, miners can signal support for the proposed centerpiece of Bitcoin Core’s scalability roadmap. The soft fork will activate if 95 percent of hash power agrees.

But Chinese mining pool ViaBTC, currently representing some 8 percent of hash power on the Bitcoin network, has indicated it will not support SegWit activation. Instead, the mining pool favors a hard fork to remove the one megabyte block size limit, as proposed by Bitcoin Core fork Bitcoin Unlimited.

To learn more about ViaBTC’s motivation, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to CEO Haipo Yang.

Haipo, you’ve made it clear you want a hard fork to increase the block size limit. Why do you consider this necessary?

The past seven-year history of Bitcoin has proven that on-chain transactions are successful and needed by users. I think a hard fork to increase the block size limit is the only way for Bitcoin to develop moving forward, and the only way to preserve the bitcoin mining business model. I support a hard fork to stop Bitcoin from marching towards extinction.

Since blocks first started filling up about a year ago, the bitcoin price has doubled. How does this indicate “a march towards extinction”?

What influences short-term fluctuations in the bitcoin price comes from speculators rather than from fundamentals like transaction throughput. Bitcoin was valued over $1000 at one point. A rebound to $700 doesn’t seem all that unusual.

Academic analysis suggests that Bitcoin needs a block size limit to guarantee miner income in the long-term. Wouldn’t you rather find out how much users will pay for transactions before worrying about Bitcoin failing?

I think by the time we find out, it will be too late. Bitcoin offers no benefits over most altcoins other than a first-mover advantage and security. And Bitcoin can lose both these advantages. If there’s not enough capacity, people will use Litecoin instead — or Ethereum or Zcash, or another altcoin, and Bitcoin will be done for.

Do you see increased transaction throughput in the short-term as the only road to success? For example, consider the “digital gold” value proposition, which doesn’t require as many cheap, on-chain transactions.

Is Bitcoin a currency or a commodity? In my view, this is a bit like the relationship between water and a boat. If bitcoin does not have widespread acceptance as a currency, then its value as a commodity is an illusion. Limiting Bitcoin’s capacity is therefore a ridiculous strategy. It’s as if Facebook would have continued to only let users with a .edu email address register. If they had done that, there wouldn’t be a Facebook today.

In your analogy, Facebook could just rent another server in order to meet capacity.  Increasing the block size presents a burden to each Bitcoin node. If you want to keep Bitcoin decentralized, it’s not as easy to scale.

The large majority of Bitcoin users have no need to run their own nodes. By design, Bitcoin allows users to make choices when it comes to speed, convenience and trust. They can use a light wallet. The trade off for that convenience is that they give up a very small amount of trust.

They give up this trust to miners. Don’t you think that having to trust third parties — in this case, miners — is against a principal goal of Bitcoin?

Based on the current quality of hardware, I don’t think increasing the block size up to four megabytes will be a problem for the foreseeable future. Users would still be able to run full nodes if they want to.

But surely you don’t think that four megabytes will be enough to meet any and all eventual demand?

We don’t know how many potential Bitcoin use cases there are, and what scenarios they will be applied to. Perhaps we’ll find that four — or maybe eight — megabytes actually is enough. What we do know is that one megabyte blocks can’t meet present users’ demand — and Bitcoin must scale.

Many use cases can also be realized through added layers. Some of these layers already exist, like ChangeTip or Coinbase’s off-chain transactions. And trustless layers like the lightning network are in production as well.

I don't deny that the lightning network and other second layer technologies have benefits. And plenty of off-chain transactions are indeed already happening, for example in exchanges. But many Bitcoin transactions also need to be made on-chain, where they can be traced. This is what second tier technologies cannot achieve.

Additionally, opening a lightning payment channel requires users to lock-up funds, which is an extra barrier to entry. If that’s the only affordable option, some users will choose to leave Bitcoin and go elsewhere. On-chain transactions are a proven concept — technologies like the lightning network are not.

The lightning network can prove itself once Segregated Witness is activated. And as a bonus, Segregated Witness almost doubles the effective block size. Yet, you intend to block its activation. Why?

Segregated Witness can be implemented more simply and cleaner via a hard fork, but Bitcoin Core has opted for a more complex soft fork. This indicates they don’t want a hard fork at all, and don’t want to increase the block size limit either. If the soft fork is adopted, I think a hard fork will be off the table. My goal is not really to block Segregated Witness in and of itself, but to work towards a Bitcoin version I think is better.

In your opinion, what must this hard fork look like, exactly?

I have proposed to transition to Bitcoin Unlimited because Bitcoin Unlimited removes the hard-coded restriction on the protocol layer completely. Once the one megabyte hard limit restriction is removed, the block size can adjust dynamically in line with the needs of users and technological progress.

In this scenario, the block size limit would effectively be controlled by a handful of mining pools representing a majority of hash power which does not sound very decentralized.

You cannot say bitcoin mining is centralized just because most miners are located in China. There are more than 20 mining pools, where the biggest pool represents no more than 20 percent of hash power on the network. There are thousands of miners, and anyone is free to start mining. Besides that, Bitcoin is a proof-of-work system. Regular users can share their opinions to try to influence the miners, but ultimately the decision is made by the miners. And of course users want bigger blocks. Of course they want to be able to send more transactions, for a lower fee. Keep in mind that miners have invested millions of dollars in Bitcoin. They won't do anything against the users’ interest.

Imagine if “Dr. Evil” invests $100 billion in mining equipment next year. Or if the Chinese government decides to regulate Bitcoin on a protocol level. If a majority of miners can increase the block size limit to the point where users can’t run full nodes, won’t this hugely centralize — and perhaps destabilize — the system?

Well yes, there is always the risk of 51% attacks. The security of Bitcoin requires that more than half of all miners are honest. The confidence people have in Bitcoin is based on this assumption. And Bitcoin will become safer when more investment is made in Bitcoin mining.

The confidence people have in Bitcoin also lies in the fact that miners cannot arbitrarily change any protocol rule. If miners hard fork to a new protocol without support from users, they would effectively fork themselves of the network.

If miners hard fork to a new protocol, why would users stay on a chain with no hash power? A network where transactions don’t confirm is useless.

Perhaps users aren’t interested in a Bitcoin where miners control the block size limit. Perhaps they don’t support a contentious hard fork, etc. Users left behind on the original network may even decide to change the proof-of-work algorithm to “fire” the existing set of miners.

I'm not at all worried about Bitcoin Core changing the proof-of-work algorithm. Such a big change in the consensus mechanism would not be accepted by the majority of the community, and as a result there would simply be one more altcoin.

Both ends of the fork will probably consider each others’ chain to be the altcoin...

In that case we’ll let the market choose which side is Bitcoin.

In that case, why not have ViaBTC hard fork right now and let the market decide straight away?

I prefer not to see a currency split, and I don’t think it will happen if we get 75 percent of all hash power on board. But Bitcoin Unlimited miners currently only control about 10 percent of hash power on the network. If we’d hard fork now, we probably wouldn’t get enough user acknowledgement and support — and meanwhile we’d undertake a tremendous opportunity loss. As a rational businessman, I won’t do that.

Let’s say your hard fork succeeds. Several Bitcoin Core developers have already indicated they have no interest in joining this new network. Who will maintain and develop this Bitcoin?

I think if Bitcoin Unlimited becomes the main chain, a rather high ratio of developers will turn to contribute. The Bitcoin code is much less complicated than that of Linux or other open source software, so in this world there are plenty of people with the ability to maintain Bitcoin.

Where are all these people, and why aren’t they maintaining Bitcoin right now?

I could do it if I wanted to.

Why don’t you?

Nobody is paying me to do it. And I can earn more by doing other things.

Couldn’t it be argued, though, that insofar as Bitcoin Core developers are paid at all, they could probably be earning more by doing other things as well?

That is wrong. They should be paid. I personally already pay two Bitcoin XT developers, and if a fork happens, I’m sure there are many more people that can fund development. Roger Ver, Jihan Wu… And there will be more mature companies in the Bitcoin ecosystem, which all have momentum to support and cultivate more Bitcoin developers too.

Do you think that the Bitcoin Core development team should be fired?

I believe that the Bitcoin Core developers currently have too much power; there's no system of checks and balances for them. They can decide to make massive changes to Bitcoin based on their own personal preferences, and then force those changes on to the users.

Neither users nor miners are forced to run Bitcoin Core. You know that, since you are, in fact, not running Bitcoin Core. Developers make a proposal; the community decides whether or not to accept it.

There’s not enough competing implementations to take that position seriously. We already had some competition, but none of these alternative clients posed a threat to Bitcoin Core. A hard fork to Bitcoin Unlimited may change the developer environment. That is what we need. No one should be able to control Bitcoin.

Is that, perhaps, what this is really about? Control?

I do think the centralization of Bitcoin development is an even bigger issue than the block size limit or Segregated Witness. Bitcoin Core has a privileged position as the “reference client.” And only a few people have the rights to merge code in it.

Bitcoin Core is a relatively loosely-knit group of volunteer developers. They choose to cooperate because they agree that’s a more effective way of getting things done. Besides, anyone can fork their code. What alternative do you propose?

I have some thoughts about that, but haven’t worked out all of the details. I think Bitcoin Core’s code should not define Bitcoin. Like many other successful open source projects, there should be a specification document to define Bitcoin. This will help alternative implementations become compatible with Bitcoin Core, meaning they can effectively compete — rather than just follow.

I think everyone would agree a specification document would be welcome. But in the end, Bitcoin is the code people run on their computers, is it not?

I believe the consensus should not be code, it should be English. It should be understandable for most Bitcoin users and companies. This way more people can have a voice, an impact.Speaking of control, who controls the hash power on ViaBTC? Some say it’s Bitmain.

Our pool system is highly available, stable and efficient. We have not produced a single orphan block, and we give all mining fees to miners. This is what's attracting hundreds of miners to our pool, big and small. The idea that Bitmain controls the hash power on ViaBTC is totally ridiculous.",Technical,-0.5859
2016/11/18,Slush Pool to Let Hashers Vote on Segregated Witness Activation: “Mining Pools Should Remain Neutral”,"Bitcoin’s oldest mining pool, Slush Pool, will let its miners vote on the Segregated Witness soft fork proposed by Bitcoin Core. By passing this choice down to individual miners that connect to the pool (sometimes also referred to as “hashers”) Slush Pool hopes to remove itself as a decision maker from the equation.

Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Slush Pool operator Marek “Slush” Palatinus stated:

“Satoshi’s idea was not to have a few entities control the network. As a mining pool we shouldn’t rule.”

Segregated Witness

Mining pools offer Bitcoin miners a solution to combine their hash power, sharing any block rewards they may find. Last year, Slush Pool was the first pool to also offer their hashers a chance to indicate preference on a potential block size limit increase hard fork. Whenever a hasher participating in the pool finds a block, that specific block is tagged with the choice of the hasher.

As a proposed soft fork per the requirement established by Bitcoin Core, Segregated Witness will require support from 95 percent of all hash power on the network to activate. Continuing its policy to put hashers in control, Slush Pool — which accounts for six percent of all hash power on the Bitcoin network — will let hashers vote in support of, or against, Segregated Witness activation.

Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Palatinus explained why he believes Slush Pool should refrain from making decisions on behalf of its hashers:

“Pools are just service providers for miners, which makes mining easier and optimizes costs. I don’t consider it much different from internet service providers, and I think we should adhere to similar principles of net neutrality. At Slush Pool, therefore, our long-term strategy is to remain neutral on potential hard forks and soft forks, and to offer tools for miners to decide for themselves.”

Palatinus himself does hope the Segregated Witness soft fork will activate. The co-inventor of pooled mining believes that the proposal will offer significant benefits that improve Bitcoin overall, with little downside.

“We see Segregated Witness as a fix of many holes left in the Bitcoin protocol, which do need to be fixed,” Palatinus said. “Problems like quadratic scaling during transaction signing, malleability issues, the inability to know the value of an input... Yes, Segregated Witness is a pretty complex solution, but these issues cannot be fixed much [more easlily]. It is also one of the most tested changes in Bitcoin history. There's huge intellectual effort behind the whole concept, and I think it would be really sad if that won't go through because of political games.”

Despite its intention to remain neutral, Slush Pool did decide to enable Segregated Witness signaling as the default. If hashers don’t change their settings, they will signal support for Segregated Witness — but they can easily switch that support off.

Block Size Debate

While Segregated Witness offers several benefits, one of these has garnered a lot of attention in the context of the block size debate in particular. The proposed soft fork replaces Bitcoin’s block size limit with a block “weight” limit, which offers an effective block size limit increase of about 0.7 to 1.0 megabyte, depending on the types of transactions included in a block.

Some proponents of a block size limit increase, however, prefer a hard fork to increase the block size limit instead. Perhaps most notably, the relatively new Chinese mining pool ViaBTC — controlling about eight percent of all hash power on the network — has indicated it will reject Segregated Witness in favor of a hard fork.

Criticizing this approach, Palatinus said he does not believe Segregated Witness and a hard fork block size limit increase are mutually exclusive. Apart from Segregated Witness signaling, Slush Pool hashers can still mine blocks indicating support for a block size limit increase hard fork.

“We don’t see Segregated Witness as a scaling solution primarily — though it will help a bit,” Palatinus explained. “And we believe that all scaling solutions — including Segregated Witness — should be adopted, regardless of politics. That’s why we let our miners vote for their preferred hard fork and soft fork at the same time, and give them an option to combine these votes. It’s not an either/or proposition.”

Palatinus himself has been a long-time proponent of increasing Bitcoin’s block size limit through a hard fork. Though, when asked by Bitcoin Magazine, the pool operator also explained he’s not confident the solution, as proposed by Bitcoin Unlimited and endorsed by ViaBTC, is the way to go at this point.

“I was in favor of increasing the block size limit because I think Bitcoin is quite anti-fragile, and do not share some of the disaster visions you hear,” Palatinus said. “However, what troubles me is that recent efforts to hard fork seem pretty light-handed and without serious research behind them. Proposals like Bitcoin Unlimited’s are adding another degree of freedom to Bitcoin's economic model, and it is unclear how much this changes incentives and the overall balance of the network.

“Simply put: I don't believe there are simple solutions for complex problems.”",Technical,0.9697
2016/11/22,The Status of the ‘Hong Kong Hard Fork’: An Update,"Last February, in the midst of Bitcoin’s long-lasting block size dispute, a group of Bitcoin Core developers, Bitcoin miners, and representatives from the Bitcoin industry met in Hong Kong. Sealing their position with a signed letter, the attendees agreed to run only Bitcoin Core-compatible consensus software for the “foreseeable future.” This avoided a potential hard fork as proposed by Bitcoin Classic or Bitcoin Unlimited — at least temporarily.

On their own behalf, the Bitcoin Core developers present at the meeting — Cory Fields, Johnson Lau, Luke Dashjr, Matt Corallo, and Peter Todd — agreed to propose a block size hard fork, with a deadline set three months after the release of Segregated Witness. If accepted by other Bitcoin Core developers and the broader Bitcoin community, the proposal could pave the way to a block size limit increase.

After months of testing and some delay, Bitcoin Core 0.13.1 became available to the public in the last week of October. With that, Segregated Witness was officially released.

Per the original agreement from February, this leaves the signatories to the agreement—who we’ll call the “Hong Kong developers”—with about 10 more weeks to propose a hard fork.

Soft-hardfork

A typical hard fork essentially creates a new protocol and network to which all users must migrate, abandoning the old protocol in the process. Unfortunately, this presents an inherent risk that not all users switch. The original protocol can live on, essentially creating two distinct networks and currencies: a coin-split. That’s exactly what happened on the Ethereum blockchain as a result of a contentious hard fork last summer, splitting into Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.

The Hong Kong developers, therefore, prefer a “soft-hardfork,” also known as a “forced soft fork” or a “firm fork,” and sometimes referred to as an “evil soft fork.” Like a typical hard fork, a soft-hardfork can change any protocol rule, including the block size limit. As Peter Todd told Bitcoin Magazine, “Many prefer a soft-hardfork for the perceived reduction in the chance that the currency will split.”

Specifically, miners apply a soft-hardfork, through hash-power majority, by only mining “empty” blocks on the original protocol — blocks that contain no transactions. Users that stay behind on this “old” chain therefore can neither accept nor send any payments. In other words, they run no risk of being defrauded on an otherwise abandoned network.

Meanwhile, all new transactions are moved to a sort of “add-on” blockchain that only nodes that have upgraded for the soft-hardfork can see. While the original blockchain is still used for proof-of-work security, the new protocol exists in parallel.

Coin-voting

The main drawback of a soft-hardfork is that it can be applied against the wish of users; in that sense, it’s somewhat coercive. Unless they want to await a possible “return” of miners to the original protocol, users have no choice but to upgrade to the new rules — or to hard fork to an entirely new protocol themselves, in effect creating a new network and currency after all.

To avoid both a coercive situation and a coin-split, the Hong Kong developers want solid indication that a soft-hardfork has consent from the Bitcoin community. They have therefore been considering two types of solutions to measure consent, both of them based on the coins controlled by users. Knows as “coin-signaling,” this solution “would allow for much safer hard forks, by showing that Bitcoin holders and users actually approve of the fork,” Todd said.

One of these methods — inspired by “hard fork opt-out bits” — lets users include extra data in all transactions they make, thereby signaling support for a potential fork. If all transactions over a certain time frame include this data, they serve as an indication that users are ready to fork.

Todd also has been developing a solution to let users vote with the coins they hold, even if they do not transact. On his blog, Todd explained in August:

“I’ve been working on coming up with more concrete mechanisms based on signaling/voting proportional to coins held, in particular, out-of-band mechanisms based on signed messages and probabilistic sampling that could potentially offer better privacy and censorship resistance, and give ‘holders’ who aren’t necessarily doing frequent transactions a voice as well.”

The Proposal

Yet, when it comes to a concrete proposal, some uncertainty remains.

Luke Dashjr, who in addition to Bitcoin Core also maintains Bitcoin Knots, presented an initial soft-hardfork proposal and preliminary code back in February, two weeks before the group met in Hong Kong. He kept improving it in the months that followed, and it’s this proposal that forms the most concrete basis of the proposed “Hong Kong hard fork.”

This proposal would increase the block size limit, though the exact size of the increase is yet to be specified. According to the Hong Kong Roundtable consensus, the increase should be around 2 MB, but will also include a reduced “discount” on witness-data to ensure that adversarial conditions don’t allow blocks bigger than 4 MB. The proposal also includes further — rather uncontroversial — optimizations.

Progress on development, though, has slowed down over the last months. This is in part because the Bitcoin miners did not seem very interested in the proposal, Todd said. Perhaps more importantly, several developers — both those in Hong Kong and others — consider the agreement to have been broken by at least one counterparty in the deal: the Chinese mining pool F2Pool.

“The whole point of putting ‘Run Bitcoin Core compatible clients’ in the agreement was for miners to stop playing political games for a few months,” Todd explained, “and to give developers a reason to work with them. By not doing that, we've been totally unable to get any other developers to consider joining the effort, and if anything, the experience soured them on the very idea.”

Additionally, most of the Hong Kong developers have seemingly come to believe that short-term community consensus on a block size limit hard fork is virtually impossible in the current climate.

“The community clearly doesn’t want a hard fork, and the Ethereum fiasco just sealed that,” Luke Dashjr told Bitcoin Magazine.

Moving Forward

That said, the Hong Kong developers will continue to work on the proposal — something Todd noted they were planning to do either way. Whether it will be finished within the allotted three months after the Segregated Witness release remains uncertain.

“Nothing in that agreement on the developers’ side was stuff we weren't interested in doing anyways,” Todd said. “The whole point was to find some common ground that people didn't previously know they had ... So I'm still working on my part, which is to design and implement better approval mechanisms that don't rely on miners to approve forks — both soft and hard.”

Dashjr also said he will continue to work on the proposal. While he is no longer strongly committed to presenting fully finalized hard-fork code within the original three-month deadline, he might. And he remains hopeful the solution will eventually be adopted.

“Maybe in a few years things will change,” Dashjr said. “After the ‘hard fork’ altcoiners go away.”",Technical,-0.1027
2016/12/28,The Teechan Solution: Scaling Bitcoin With Trusted Hardware,"Scalability has been a central issue within the Bitcoin community for well over a year now.

Amongst the most promising innovations being developed are bidirectional payment channels. These can be extended to the Lightning Network, allowing users to transact securely with minimal footprint on the blockchain. Performance of these solutions would be significantly improved by Segregated Witness, the protocol upgrade proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team. However, the Segregated Witness soft fork has not activated yet.

Last week, four researchers from Imperial College London and Cornell University — Joshua Lind, Ittay Eyal, Peter Pietzuch and Emin Gün Sirer — proposed a different payment channel solution. Loosely resembling the OtherCoin concept, the researchers published a white paper detailing their implementation, dubbed “Teechan,” and successfully tested an early version of the software.

Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Eyal said he believes Teechan is superior to the proposed alternatives.

“Teechan is more efficient than other payment channels. It’s faster to complete a payment, and allows for more payments per second,” the Cornell University researcher said. “Plus, it doesn’t require any changes to the current Bitcoin protocol.”

The Good Ol’ Payment Channel

In essence, Bitcoin payment channels are just multisignature (“multisig”) addresses, but leveraged in clever ways.

Let’s say Alice and Bob want to open a payment channel between them. To do so, they create a 2-of-2 multisig address, for which each will generate and control one private key. Funds from this multisig address can be spent only if both Alice and Bob sign a transaction with their private keys.

Next, both Alice and Bob send funds to this address; perhaps one bitcoin each. This funding transaction is broadcast and recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, so the bitcoins are “locked in.”

As such, the “channel state” is 1-1: they both have a balance of one bitcoin each.

Now, Alice wants to buy a pair of shoes from Bob worth 0.1 bitcoins. Instead of sending 0.1 bitcoins to Bob on the blockchain, Alice and Bob just agree that Bob should now get 1.1 bitcoins from the multisig address, and Alice 0.9 bitcoins.

As such, the channel state is 0.9-1.1. Alice has effectively paid Bob 0.1 bitcoins.

If Alice or Bob (or both) want to close the channel, they sign and broadcast a transaction from their multisig address, which pays each their share as determined by the latest channel state. In this case 0.9-1.1.

“The beauty of payment channels is that, in the meantime, Alice and Bob could have transacted thousands of times,” Eyal said. “As long as they don’t broadcast transactions to the Bitcoin network, they can keep updating the channel, effectively paying each other ‘off-chain’ as much as they want.”

Of course, there are some challenges in making all this work securely. Most important, payment channels require some kind of solution to ensure that counterparties sign off on a transaction representing the latest channel state. And payment channels require some kind of solution to ensure that counterparties sign off only on the latest channel state. (If Alice, for example, could broadcast an older channel state, it would allow her to claim the full 1 bitcoin even after she bought the shoes.)

Typical bidirectional payment channels solve this problem in novel ways that require time locks and other trickery. This works, but in some cases it requires a malleability fix (Segregated Witness) — which is still awaiting activation.

Lind, Eyal, Pietzuch and Sirer propose a different solution.

What’s in the Box?

Teechan, which stands for Trusted Execution Environment Channel, is a new payment channel protocol. Like Bitcoin itself, the solution is based on open-source software: transparent and verifiable by anyone.

But to ensure that Alice or Bob can broadcast the latest channel state and only the latest channel state, Teechan leverages “trusted execution environments” (TEEs). TEEs are secure hardware components included in Intel CPUs with Software Guard Extensions (SGX); many new computers have them. (See full list here.)

“With SGX TEEs, no one can ‘look inside’ to see what’s going on. Unencrypted data never leaves the chip, and so not even the owner of a computer with an SGX can observe what these chips are doing; they only see the end result,” Eyal explained.

With Teechan, both Alice and Bob first have their own TEE generate a public and private key pair. Because these keys are generated inside of the TEE, neither Alice nor Bob knows what “their” private keys are.

Then, Alice and Bob have their TEEs connect and swap public keys. As such, their TEEs can actually communicate in encrypted form, ensuring that Alice and Bob cannot decipher what their TEEs are communicating.

Additionally, Alice and Bob have both their TEEs generate a Bitcoin private key. Again, neither Alice nor Bob know what “their” own Bitcoin private key is; it’s inside the TEE.

Alice and Bob’s TEEs swap their private keys, in encrypted form over their secure channel. So, both TEEs now have both private keys — while Alice and Bob themselves know neither.

Then, with these private keys, their TEEs establish a pretty regular payment channel. They generate a multisig address, which both Alice and Bob then fund with, say, 1 bitcoin. This funding transaction is broadcast and recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain and is “locked in.”

Whenever Alice and Bob pay each other, they update the state of their payment channel, all from within their TEEs. In practice, this just means their TEEs keep track of the channel state. And both TEEs will update the channel state only if both Alice and Bob agree.

Finally, if Alice wants to close the channel, her TEE uses both Bitcoin private keys to sign a transaction reflecting the latest channel state. This transaction is broadcast to the Bitcoin network, and both Alice and Bob get their funds as determined by the latest channel state. (If Bob wants to close the channel, of course, Bob’s TEE signs this closing transaction.)

The TEEs solve both main payment channel challenges. Since both Alice’s and Bob’s TEEs control both Bitcoin private keys, they can always be sure to get their funds out. And the reason Alice and Bob cannot broadcast older channel states is simple: the Teechan software won’t allow it.

All the Trust That's Required to Make It Work ...

All this really only leaves one problem: Alice could lie to Bob about using a TEE in the first place — or Bob could lie to Alice.

Even though they would claim they created their Bitcoin private keys inside of the TEEs, and even though they’d exchange encrypted messages, they could be doing all of this from a regular CPU. Alice could hold on to all of her keys, allowing her to also decrypt Bob’s Bitcoin private key. With it, she could take all the funds from the channel.

This is where a little bit of trust comes in.

By a process called “remote attestation,” Intel — the creator of the SGX CPU that both Alice and Bob use — has a way to verify whether Alice and Bob are telling the truth. Using a special private key that only Intel should have, the technology company can use the first package Alice and Bob send across (the encrypted funding transaction), and check that it was produced both with the Teechan software and from their TEEs. However, Intel does not get to see the the content of the package; it remains encrypted.

If Alice and Bob trust Intel not to lie to them, they can be sure their counterparty really created the funding transaction from their TEEs. Alice and Bob can be sure neither of them know the Bitcoin private keys for their shared multisig address.

This works well if you trust Intel. Though of course, for this very reason, some Bitcoin purists won’t like the solution. For one, they don’t want to have to trust anyone, not even Intel. And second, the solution is not entirely permissionless: it requires a remote attestation license from Intel, which so far has been difficult to obtain.

Eyal, however, believes these concerns are overstated.

“Anyone running their Bitcoin software on an Intel machine is already placing their trust in Intel, so trusting the SGX mechanism seems natural,” he said. “And if they don’t, there are alternatives TEEs, if one prefers another TEE vendor due to trust or availability considerations. Additionally, the trust is limited to the involved parties: the participants in the payment channel, and the TEE vendor. Anyone outside the channel — all other Bitcoin users — remain oblivious to the channel construction and trust relations involved.”",Technical,0.6597
2016/12/29,Bitcoin Magazine’s Top 6 Tech Stories of 2016,"Bitcoin, digital currency and blockchain technology experienced another explosive year in 2016. While bitcoin breached the all-time high in USD market cap, several new digital currencies claimed a place in the spotlights as well, while the blockchain buzz arguably peaked it all.

Of course, Bitcoin Magazine kept up with all of it. Looking back on 2016, we compiled three top 6 lists, with our best-read topics in technology, business and news.

These were 2016’s six top stories in technology, by popularity.

6: BIP 151’s End-to-End Encryption

Communication between Bitcoin nodes — and between nodes and SPV clients — is currently not encrypted by default. Unless precautions are taken, data transmitted over the Bitcoin network can be tracked by internet service providers, open-WiFi providers and anyone monitoring the Bitcoin network.

But that may soon change. Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 151, drafted by Bitcoin Core developer Jonas Schnelli, is designed to make encryption between Bitcoin nodes the standard. If widely adopted (and alternative Bitcoin implementation bcoin already did adopt the solution), this should make it harder to censor specific transactions or blocks, while potentially offering increased privacy to Bitcoin users.

Although not everyone believes BIP 151 is preferable over conventional methods such as Tor or VPNs, the proposal garnered a lot of interest among Bitcoin Magazine readers, securing a sixth place on our list for 2016.

5: The Lightning Network

Throughout most of 2016, the central topic of debate within the Bitcoin community was, undoubtedly, scaling. The question of how best to increase transaction throughput on the Bitcoin network was on nearly everyone’s mind, while preferred solutions vary.

As one of the most promising proposals, the lightning network could just be a game changer. The innovative solution — which is especially suited for micropayments — should minimize the amount of “on-chain” transactions required, while also realizing instant confirmations and increased privacy.

The lightning network and similar, compatible projects like Amiko Pay and Thunder were first proposed in 2015, and are by now developed by at least six companies. In a best-case scenario, production-ready software could be launched this winter — though much depends on activation of the Segregated Witness soft fork as proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team.

Whether the lightning network will be as successful as many hope remains to be seen, but it was definitely one of the most popular topics on Bitcoin Magazine, placing fifth on this year’s list.

4: Multisig

Number four on our list is an oldie but a goodie: multisignature, or multisig, transactions.

Multisig transactions are transactions that require multiple signatures to be valid. Using multisig, several people can for example share a single wallet and be sure no single person runs off with the funds. More recently, multisig has become the basis for more complex solutions, such as the lightning network.

Technically, multisig has been part of the Bitcoin protocol ever since Satoshi Nakamoto launched the code in 2009, though it was nonstandard during the first years. It became a standard part of the Bitcoin protocol in 2012. Over the four years since, multisig has become fairly common, with several wallets offering the option by default.

Multisig is probably still the most basic, but also the most used, smart contract application to date, which could explain why Bitcoin Magazine’s article on the topic is still among the most popular pieces on the website.

3: Ethereum and Turing Completeness

In many ways, 2016 was the year of Ethereum. The smart contract platform itself (Ethereum) and its native token (ether/ETH) experienced a boom throughout the first half of the year: ETH increased from less than $1 to over $20. And while the exchange rate has since dropped to around $8, it’s still one of the best-performing digital currencies of 2016.

The Ethereum smart contract platform, moreover, has been heralded by some as the future not only of digital currency but perhaps even of computing itself. While Bitcoin is somewhat limited in scope, Ethereum’s Turing completeness allows for the creation of any blockchain-based software application.

But Ethereum has also been through a rough second half of 2016. First, the high-profile multimillion-dollar investment platform “The DAO” was compromised, after which the Ethereum Foundation opted for a controversial emergency hard fork to restore lost funds — causing a split in the blockchain. Later, Ethereum was subject to a series of attacks, which had to be solved with more hard forks.

While some see this series of hard forks to be a useful process to make Ethereum more robust against future attacks, others question whether Turing completeness is really a desirable feature for a digital currency, after all.

Either way, Ethereum and its Turing completeness were the focus of much attention throughout 2016, securing a third place on our list.

2: Segregated Witness

First publicly presented a couple weeks before the close of 2015, Segregated Witness was developed and tested throughout most of 2016 and officially launched late October of this year.

A centerpiece of Bitcoin Core’s scalability road map, the proposed soft fork could offer several benefits. Perhaps most important, Segregated Witness would fix malleability, in effect laying the groundwork for optimized versions of the aforementioned lightning network. The proposed protocol upgrade would also extend Bitcoin’s flexibility through script versioning; it includes an effective block-size limit increase and more.

However, throughout the last quarter of 2016, it became clear that activation of the soft fork is not a given. At least one mining pool — China-based ViaBTC — actively opposes activation of the Segregated Witness soft fork. Whether or not the proposal will be adopted could well turn out to be one of the most important stories of 2017.

1: Zcash and zkSNARKs

Ethereum was not the only Bitcoin alternative to steal headlines in 2016.

Started off as an anonymity layer for Bitcoin back in 2013, Zcash launched as an altcoin in October.

The digital currency that is being developed by Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn and his team immediately generated massive hype. Partly due to its controversial but heavily publicized “trusted setup,” partly due to its crazy market action shortly after launch and, of course, also partly due to its underlying technology: zkSNARKs.

A zkSNARK — the “zk” stands for zero-knowledge and the “SNARK” for Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge — is a novel cryptographic technique that guarantees the validity of transactions while revealing almost no data about these transactions at all. In Zcash, this is utilized to hide which addresses are transacting and how much money is sent. Zcash achieves a level of anonymity not seen before in any digital currency.

2017/1/3,Ethereum Classic Hard Forks; Diffuses ‘Difficulty Bomb’,"If the split between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic wasn’t definitive before, it is now.

Ethereum Classic, the project born out of rejection of Ethereum’s reversal of The DAO, hard forked today. With that, Ethereum Classic has implemented the biggest protocol change yet, and further differentiated itself from the Ethereum project.

Most importantly, the hard fork — dubbed “Die Hard” — diffused the difficulty bomb, which was set to freeze the protocol later this year. Additionally, Ethereum Classic implemented replay protection, to ensure Ethereum transactions are no longer valid on the Ethereum Classic chain and vice versa. It also adjusted technical parameters to increase the cost of certain spam attacks.

“This protocol upgrade demonstrated growing maturity of Ethereum Classic, as it's starting to blaze its own path not only in terms of ideology, but also technical choices,” Ethereum Classic’s project coordinator, “Arvicco” told Bitcoin Magazine. “Such as a commitment to staying on proof-of-work consensus for a prolonged period.”

The Difficulty Bomb

The original Ethereum protocol, as implemented by the Ethereum Foundation, included a so-called “difficulty bomb.” Baked into the software, Ethereum’s mining difficulty is programmed to increase exponentially over time. This has been unnoticeable up till now, but by around April or May of this year, it is set to increase so rapidly that mining will necessarily become unprofitable. As a result, no more blocks will be found at all, and the protocol will effectively freeze, creating an “Ice Age.”

The Ethereum Foundation implemented this difficulty bomb to force its own hand — and that of the broader Ethereum community. As outlined in its release documents, the Ethereum Foundation planned to roll out the Ethereum project in several stages, each one requiring a hard fork. The difficulty bomb was implemented to ensure that developers and the community would have to switch to a new protocol this year; eventually working toward a proof-of-stake mining algorithm known as “Casper.”

As a continuation of the original Ethereum protocol, Ethereum Classic also included that difficulty bomb. The Ethereum Classic community, however, has decided it will not follow the Ethereum Foundation road map, most notably regarding Casper. As such, there is little need for Ethereum Classic to keep the difficulty bomb, and it was removed with the Die Hard hard fork.

This gives the project more time to work on further protocol development, Arvicco said.

“Now that the most critical technical issues such as difficulty bomb and replay protection are resolved, ETC dev team will start focusing more on longer-term changes, such as monetary policy and improved platform stability and security.”

The Split

With every hard fork, there exists a risk of not everyone switching to the new protocol, in effect creating two different networks and currencies. This is how the Ethereum Classic project itself started, of course, and could happen again.

So far, however, Die Hard seems to have gone through with few holdouts. While it is too early to tell with full certainty whether the ecosystem has fully switched to the new protocol, there didn’t appear to be much opposition beforehand. A vast majority of hash power has also made the switch — though at time of writing a small number of miners hadn’t yet.

“Even though we campaigned for two weeks for everyone to upgrade, about 0.5 percent of hash power kept mining on the old chain for a while,” Arvicco said. “That was to be expected, though; with our last fork in October that was about 3 to 5 percent. So, there is  progress.”

And the odds of these holdouts bootstrapping their own currency seems unlikely, Arvicco believes.

“Not unless there is a community ready to support it both in terms of participation and real money. And the prospects of such community is not good with the bomb blowing up pretty soon.”",Technical,-0.9772
2017/1/11,Atomic Swaps: How the Lightning Network Extends to Altcoins,"It is well-known that Bitcoin’s upcoming lightning network promises instant confirmations and low fees. What is not as well-known is that this highly anticipated scaling layer is actually not limited to Bitcoin. The very same peer-to-peer protocol can potentially be extended to, and made interoperable with, many altcoins. This could allow for trustless altcoin payment processors, decentralized altcoin exchanges and perhaps even cheaper bitcoin-to-bitcoin payments and more.

Atomic Swaps

Interoperability between Bitcoin and altcoins is not new. So-called atomic swaps (or atomic cross-chain trading) were first described by Tier Nolan back in 2013.

Let’s say Alice has 200 litecoins, but prefers 1 bitcoin. And Bob has 1 bitcoin, but prefers 200 litecoins. So Alice and Bob agree to trade. But neither Alice nor Bob trust each other, so neither wants to be the first to send over the coins. The other may not return the favor.

That’s why Alice and Bob set up an atomic swap.

Atomic swaps utilize a clever trick known as a hash time-locked contract, which in turn leverages the potential of multisignature addresses and time-locks. All this is enabled by the basic scripting language found in Bitcoin and most altcoins, including Litecoin.

In short, Alice and Bob submit transactions to both blockchains: one on Bitcoin and one on Litecoin. The Bitcoin transaction sends 1 bitcoin from Bob to Alice, but Alice can only claim this bitcoin if she reveals a secret number only she knows. The Litecoin transaction sends 200 litecoins from Alice to Bob, but requires the same secret number on both chains.

When Alice claims her bitcoin, she reveals her secret number on the Bitcoin blockchain. And with that same secret number, Bob can, in turn, claim his 200 litecoins.

Even though the transactions are on completely different blockchains, they are effectively linked. Bob just needs to monitor the Bitcoin blockchain to see if Alice claimed her bitcoin so that he can claim his litecoins.

All this works today. But it is a bit of a hassle. Alice and Bob need to find each other to set up the atomic swap, which then requires several transactions on multiple blockchains.

This can be improved.

(Note: there are some extra steps to ensure that Alice actually does claim her bitcoin within a limited amount of time so that Bob can also claim his litecoins in a timely manner. The specifics are beyond the scope of this article; however, for details on how hash time-locked contracts work, see Understanding the Lightning Network, Part 2: Creating the Network.)

Lightning Network(s)

The lightning network is specifically designed for Bitcoin. But altcoins that are forked from Bitcoin’s codebase — like Litecoin, Dogecoin or Zcash — are typically capable of hosting lightning networks as well. Other altcoins, as long as they include similar or more extensive scripting capabilities (like Ethereum or Ethereum Classic), enable similar solutions.

Like atomic swaps, the lightning network utilizes hash time-locked contracts. Where atomic swaps effectively link blockchains, the lightning network links payment channels. This way, if both Alice and Bob have a payment channel open with Carol, they can transact through Carol, without needing to trust Carol.

And exactly because the underlying mechanics are the same, it’s no stretch to merge the lightning network with atomic swaps. This process makes different lightning networks interoperable across blockchains.

This means that a peer that opens channels on both blockchains could serve as a payment processor, an altcoin exchange and more.

Let’s say, for example, that Alice wants to buy a computer from Bob, for which Bob charges 1 bitcoin, but Alice only owns litecoins. Luckily, Carol has a Litecoin channel open with Alice, and a Bitcoin channel open with Bob. So Alice can now send 200 litecoins to Carol, for Carol to send 1 bitcoin to Bob. Since this is all linked with hash time-locked contracts, Carol effectively acts as a trustless payment processor.

And if Alice and Bob both have a Bitcoin payment channel as well as a Litecoin channel with Carol, they can also swap funds. Alice can send 200 litecoins to Carol, which Carol forwards to Bob. Bob then sends 1 bitcoin to Carol in exchange, which Carol now forwards to Alice. And again, all this is still linked with hash time-locked contracts, so now Carol effectively acts as a trustless altcoin exchange.

Lastly, alternative lightning networks may even improve Bitcoin’s lightning network in some ways. For example, a bitcoin-to-bitcoin payment could be routed through Litecoin peers, if that happens to be the cheapest route. Or, users operating on multiple coins could rebalance their channels. If Alice has 400 litecoins but no bitcoins in her channel with Bob, she may want to exchange 200 litecoins to fund her Bitcoin channel.

Challenges

Some challenges do remain in order to realize most of this scenario.

One is denial of service (DoS) protection. While the mechanics of the lightning network ensure that no peers can steal funds, intermediaries can block or stall the payment process. To solve this, channels with non-cooperating peers must be closed. This form of punishment should make DoS attacks expensive, as non-cooperating peers need to keep opening channels.

But to verify that the channel was closed and the attacker punished, each peer along a payment chain must be able to monitor all participants. Even if only two peers along a chain of six use Litecoin, all six peers should be able to recognize a Litecoin transaction in case the channel is closed.

And of course, lightning networks must first be rolled out. This, in most cases, requires a malleability fix, at least for optimal performance. Segregated Witness — the malleability fix proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team — currently awaits activation on both the Bitcoin network and on several altcoins, including Litecoin.

But Segregated Witness has not activated yet, and whether it ever will depends on miners — both on Bitcoin as well as on altcoins.

2017/1/12,Op Ed: Here’s Why the Bitcoin Price Skyrocketed in 2016 Despite Scalability Concerns,"For the past two years, the main topic of conversation in the Bitcoin community has been the scalability debate. While the peer-to-peer digital currency system processes more than 300,000 on-blockchain transactions per day and recently reached an $18 billion market cap for the first time, the path toward scaling this system to a global economy over the long-term is sometimes seen as unclear.

After years of debate over Bitcoin’s effective transaction capacity limit, the plan for capacity increases that has gained the highest level of support from current Bitcoin Core contributors, bitcoin wallet providers and bitcoin miners was put forth by Blockstream CTO and Bitcoin Core contributor Gregory Maxwell in December of 2015.

Maxwell’s plan includes a variety of changes to the protocol to improve the usefulness of various second-layer approaches to scaling Bitcoin, such as the lightning network. The most recent improvement released as part of this scaling roadmap is called Segregated Witness, and it includes an effective doubling of Bitcoin’s block-size limit.

There were a number of other proposals made for scaling Bitcoin over the years, and at least one developer, Mike Hearn, left the project entirely after his preferred solution was not implemented by the Bitcoin community. In a widely circulated blog post published roughly one year ago, Hearn claimed that the Bitcoin experiment had failed.

In the time since Hearn’s departure, which BitTorrent creator Bram Cohen referred to as a “whiny ragequit,” the bitcoin price has nearly doubled.

Bitcoin Price Rises Despite Network Congestion Concerns

One of the main reasons Hearn referred to Bitcoin as a failed experiment had to do with network congestion. The effective limit on the number of transactions that the Bitcoin network can process has not been raised, and blocks were effectively full with a backlog of pending transactions on more than one occasion this past year.

Some in the Bitcoin community believed this network congestion would effectively block new people from entering the Bitcoin ecosystem or at least turn off new users via higher fees and longer payment confirmation times.

It’s likely true that at least a few potential new users decided not to use Bitcoin in 2016 because of the perceived issues associated with full blocks. The reason the bitcoin price continued to rise in 2016 despite this network congestion may have to do with the fact that those who are using bitcoin primarily as a store of value aren’t much affected by network congestion.

After all, in order to use bitcoin as a store of value, users technically only need to complete two transactions, potentially years apart: one for buying the bitcoins and one for selling the bitcoins. Those who decide to take $1 million and put it into bitcoin are the ones who have the greatest effect on the price. Those who are simply transacting via the Bitcoin network as a payment rails will have a buy and sell order on both sides of their transactions, which therefore has a marginal effect on the overall price.

Those Who Need Bitcoin Are Willing to Pay Higher Fees

Outside of use for philosophical reasons, there still aren’t many use cases for Bitcoin. Having said that, the use cases that do exist usually involve situations where there is simply no other solution on the market. For these use cases, demand for Bitcoin tends to be inelastic. This isn’t to say there aren’t some transactional use cases of Bitcoin that are being priced out by higher fees.

For example, someone who has been victimized by a hacker by way of ransomware has no option other than Bitcoin to make that ransom payment. If the ransomware victim feels he or she has to make the ransom payment in order to regain access to their files, then they aren’t too concerned with what type of fee will need to be attached to their payment (within practical limits).

Those who view bitcoin as a store of value also fall under this category as there is no competition with bitcoin in the “digital gold” market. Yes, alternative digital currencies exist, but they have roughly zero non-speculative use cases and they’re often viewed as nothing more than testnets for Bitcoin. For this reason, Bloq Economist Paul Sztorc refers to them as “testnet scams.” Anyone who wants to use an algorithmically controlled store of value will need to pay the necessary fees to gain access to the bitcoin tokens.

Bitcoin Still Needs to Scale for Payments

Although clear, reliable Bitcoin user statistics can be difficult to analyze, there are indications that most people use bitcoin as a store of value. Having said that, it still makes sense to make improvements to make sure bitcoin also works well as a medium of exchange. Although bitcoin could do quite well as a store of value that is somewhat difficult to move around, a large amount of value can be added by helping the technology fulfill its original, overstated promise of free, instant and anonymous online transactions.

There is a variety of potential solutions in the works when it comes to fulfilling these key aspects of bitcoin as a digital bearer asset, and many of them were on display at the Scaling Bitcoin workshop in October. The most helpful advancements may be the ones that are able to improve scalability and user privacy at the same time, such as lightning networks or TumbleBit.

Adding new features to Bitcoin can be extremely difficult when it is supposed to be an apolitical, algorithmic store of value. For this reason, privacy and scalability improvements are rolled out in a backward-compatible manner in a process known as a soft fork.

Hard forks, or changes that are incompatible with Bitcoin’s current consensus rules, may also be possible, but some investors, such as Needham & Company, are concerned with the potential negative effects a split of the network into two separate assets could have on the perception of bitcoin as a digital gold.

2017/1/12,Bitcoin Core 0.13.2 Release: Graceful Recovery,"The Bitcoin Core development team released Bitcoin Core 0.13.2 on January 3. As a minor release, the latest version of the Bitcoin Core software features bug fixes and performance improvements.

The most notable update is a change to wallet handling of mempool rejection. This enables more graceful recovery from specific edge cases where transactions depend on other unconfirmed transactions. In other words, it prevents transactions from getting stuck in the wallet and ensures that the Bitcoin Core software doesn’t need to be restarted to fix the issue.

To be specific, Bitcoin Core developer and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo explained during an interview with Bitcoin Magazine that the “sendtoaddress” and “sendmany” RPC calls merge several operations, which may make proper error handling difficult.

“In the Ciphrex application development stack, we use multiple calls to send transactions: Create, Sign, Send. Bitcoin Core also does this for the lower-level raw transaction processing calls,"" Lombrozo told Bitcoin Magazine.

""I still think the send RPC calls combine too many operations into a single call, which makes it hard to do proper error handling as an application developer. But this change at least allows for more graceful recovery from a specific edge case,” Lombrozo added.

Adoption Rate and SegWit

For normal, everyday users, the change from Bitcoin Core 0.13.1 will probably not be a big one. Like Bitcoin Core 0.13.1, Bitcoin Core 0.13.2 includes code for the Segregated Witness soft fork — but activation of course depends on miners. Users are not required to upgrade to Bitcoin Core 0.13.2 in order to remain part of the Bitcoin network, though it is advised.

Within a week since the release of Bitcoin Core 0.13.2, over 12 percent of reachable Bitcoin nodes as stated by Bitnodes have already upgraded to the new release.

The release of 0.13.2 also marks the first minor upgrade of the Bitcoin software in 2017. Bitcoin experts, including Andreas Antonopoulos and Bitcoin Core developer Jonas Schnelli, unanimously agreed that 2016 was an important year in Bitcoin development and innovation.

Schnelli revealed that 517 Github contributors played an active role in the development of Bitcoin, and nearly 4.5 commits were made on a daily basis throughout the year. Beginning with the new Bitcoin Core release, Bitcoin users and enthusiasts hope to see yet another active year of development in 2017.",Technical,0.4588
2017/1/13,Lightning Network One Step Closer to Reality as Lightning Labs Announces Alpha Release,"Lightning Labs, one of the prominent companies working to realize the lightning network, announced this week the alpha release of the open-source lightning daemon they've been spearheading: LND. While only compatible with Bitcoin’s testnet so far, the software is relatively feature-complete and operational.

“We’re now looking for the wider community to test the software,” Joseph Poon, Lightning Labs developer and co-author of the lightning network white paper, told Bitcoin Magazine. “To get it ready for widespread use, but also to explore new use cases this enables.”

The Lightning Network

The lightning network is a highly anticipated second-layer protocol to be rolled out on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain. Cleverly utilizing Bitcoin’s programmable elements (like multisignature and time-locks), lightning users should be able to make a virtually unlimited number of off-chain transactions with instant confirmations and at low cost. This should boost Bitcoin’s micropayment-ability, overall scalability and even privacy.

The release of LND v0.1-alpha, written in the Go programming language, signifies that development of the protocol is on track. The implementation developed by Lightning Labs, but also BitFury and others, can open and close channels with counterparties to transact, route payments over the network, forward transactions from other users and more.

“Things are progressing very well,” Poon acknowledged. “We now mainly need to finalize the specification, work on cross-compatibility with other implementations and improve various components like payment receipts and multi-hop payments. Additionally, we’ll focus on optimizing performance over the next couple of months.”

That said, the lightning daemon is not very user-friendly yet, as it’s mostly intended for developers and experimentation. It doesn’t include a user interface — though that will soon change, the team noted — and is so far only compatible with Bitcoin’s testnet.

Lightning Labs will also publish a walk-through post soon, and open a channel faucet for anyone to get their hands on some testnet coins in lightning channels.

Timeframe

The big question, of course, is when everyday users will be able to send and receive lightning transactions on Bitcoin’s main net.

Earlier estimates suggested that the lightning network could be operational this winter, which from a technical perspective doesn’t seem far off now. Different lightning teams met in Milan after the Scaling Bitcoin workshops in October of 2016, where they agreed on shared specifications now known as “BOLT.”  At least two other companies, Blockchain (Thunder) and Blockstream (Lightningd), have released early iterations of lightning software as well, while ACINQ, Amiko Pay and MIT’s DCI are also working on implementations.

With the exception of Thunder, most lightning software cannot yet be used on Bitcoin’s main net, however, as it is built with Segregated Witness in mind. The soft fork protocol change proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team requires 95 percent hash power support from miners to activate — but has so far remained stagnant around 25 or 30 percent.

While Segregated Witness is not strictly necessary for the lightning network to work, Lightning Labs pointed out it would significantly benefit the protocol.

“It would allow users to outsource channel monitoring, which means they won’t have to constantly keep an eye on the Bitcoin blockchain. Meanwhile channels could be kept open longer and closed quicker. It would offer a better user experience overall,” Lightning Labs developer Laolu Osuntokun said.

Lightning Labs Co-Founder Elizabeth Stark added: “One of the reasons why we wanted to put our software release and blog out there is to show how much better all of this could work with Segregated Witness activated.”

If the Segregated Witness soft fork does activate, the LND alpha software could immediately be tested on Bitcoin’s main net. Though for security reasons, as the team pointed out, preferably only with tiny amounts at first.",Technical,0.9939
2017/1/19,Blockstream Releases Sidechain White Paper on Liquid and Strong Federations,"The seminal Bitcoin sidechains white paper “Enabling Blockchain Innovations with Pegged Sidechains,” released in 2014 by a team that went on to form Blockstream, a leading company in the blockchain space, envisaged an ecosystem of “sidechains” separate from the main Bitcoin blockchain but interoperable with it via peg mechanisms.

A sidechain can carry bitcoin as currency, in which case users will be able to seamlessly transfer bitcoin between the sidechain and the main blockchain. A sidechain can implement more powerful scripting features or more watertight privacy. Increased throughput is another key improvement over Bitcoin that can be implemented in a sidechain.

In 2015, Bitcoin Magazine covered Blockstream’s plans for the first commercial Bitcoin sidechain, code-named “Liquid,” able to provide instant transactions with a fast settlement layer for bitcoin exchanges, brokerages and other industry members. “As its main advantage, Liquid provides instant and secure transactions among all users of the sidechain,” claims Blockstream. “While Bitcoin transactions can typically take up to an hour to be sufficiently secured by the blockchain, Liquid offers a similar level of security within seconds.”

Now Blockstream has released another white paper, titled “Strong Federations: An Interoperable Blockchain Solution to Centralized Third Party Risks.” The new white paper introduces improvements over the federated peg mechanism mentioned in the first white paper. In particular, the consensus mechanism and trust model have been updated; mechanisms that allow settlement back to a parent chain in case of failure have also been introduced.

In essence, Strong Federations are cleverly constructed multisig addresses, where bitcoins are “locked in.” These bitcoins can be unlocked only if enough key holders agree the payment is valid. This setup can make for publicly verifiable, Byzantine-robust transaction networks that facilitate movement of any asset among disparate markets, without requiring centralized trust in any single party. It can also provide commercial privacy, with support for transactions where asset types and amounts are opaque while preserving the public verifiability inherent to Bitcoin.

The new white paper consolidates and expands the initial concept of Liquid, which is now presented as a first implementation of a Strong Federation. “The first working implementation of a Strong Federation is Liquid — a Bitcoin exchange and brokerage multi-signature sidechain that bypasses Bitcoin’s inherent limitations while leveraging its security properties,” note the authors. In Liquid, “consensus history is a blockchain where every block is signed by the majority of a deterministic, globally-distributed set of functionaries running on hardened platforms, a methodology that directly aligns incentives for the participants.”

According to Blockstream, Strong Federations will be useful in many general-purpose industries, especially those that need secure and private exchange of digital assets, without a single party that controls the custodianship, execution and settling of transactions.

“This new construction establishes a security profile inherently superior to existing methods of rapid transfer and settlement among exchanges and brokerages, and is directly applicable to other problems within existing financial institutions,” note Blockstream experts Johnny Dilley, Jonathan Wilkins and Marta Piekarska, co-authors of the white paper.

It’s worth noting that, contrary to the current trend toward sanitized, “permissioned” non-Bitcoin blockchains that deliberately disown the libertarian attitude of early Bitcoin adopters, the Blockstream approach remains anchored to the public Bitcoin blockchain and informed by a commitment to privacy and liberty.

“Our efforts focus on developing systems that protect individual liberty through cryptographic mechanisms as the right to privacy is one of the essential components of a free society,” the authors of the white paper state. “Liquid and Strong Federations attempt to improve upon the privacy guarantees offered by Bitcoin, whose open-by-default model often results in users inadvertently leaking personally-identifying information.”",Technical,0.5106
2017/1/23,Decline in Empty Blocks Has Increased Bitcoin’s Transaction Capacity,"Empty blocks have turned into a controversial topic in the Bitcoin community over the past few months. This renewed attention on the topic has been sparked by the number of nearly-empty blocks mined by Antpool recently.

An empty block is one that only contains a coinbase transaction. This may seem counterproductive, but there are incentives in place that make mining empty blocks a practical endeavor from the perspective of a miner.

Why Do Miners Mine Empty Blocks?

According to Bitcoin Core contributor Matt Corallo, there are three main reasons as to why empty blocks have been mined in the past.

The first issue had to do with a mining pool letting the network know that a new block had been found. This was especially problematic when a miner in China was trying to let nodes on the other side of the Great Firewall know about a newly mined block. Other nodes would essentially be notified of a new block’s existence but would still need to download the entire block over a slow connection.

Block relay time between peers was also a problem in the past, but Corallo’s FIBRE network has mostly negated this issue. FIBRE is a protocol used to relay blocks around a network of nodes with essentially no delay.

Lastly, it takes time for a miner to figure out which transactions are in a block and validate them. The process of validating the previous block’s transactions and removing them from the mempool is the main culprit behind the majority of the empty blocks that are still being mined on the network.

The Decline of Empty Blocks

In 2015 and early 2016, empty blocks were quite common on the network. According to data from Bitfury, a total of 264 empty blocks were mined in November 2015. At an average of 1,994 transactions per block (the average transaction count in completely full blocks up to this point), that’s the equivalent of over 525,000 transactions worth of unused block space. That is many more transactions than the entire network has processed on any single day of its existence.

emptyblockstats.png

December 2016, the most recent month for which data is available, only 34 empty blocks were mined. So what happened?

For one, the issue of empty blocks was brought up at the inaugural Bitcoin Roundtable meeting between the Bitcoin mining community and a few Bitcoin Core contributors.

“Everyone was saying more capacity was needed, so that was something we could address in the very short term.” BTCC COO Samson Mow told Bitcoin Magazine.

According to Mow, BTCC’s mining pool was able to reduce the number of empty blocks they produced through various architecture improvements involving bandwidth reduction and data broadcast improvements.

Antpool has also made improvements to its own systems.

“We developed a new block broadcast system,” an Antpool representative told Bitcoin Magazine. “Blocks can be broadcast to the world in one to three seconds through this system, the recent system is the final testing, and now there will be some empty or small blocks, but after we finished the test, the probability of [an] empty block appears to be minimum, and we will open source system.”

In the view of BTC.com’s Kevin Pan, the decline of empty blocks has occurred in large part because of compact blocks, which is an improvement that was implemented in Bitcoin Core 0.13 and FIBRE.

ViaBTC’s own improvements allowed it to become the largest mining pool that does SPV mining to not mine an empty block over the course of last month.

BitFury, on the other hand, has never mined an empty block.

“Bitfury started to use special techniques to avoid empty blocks because it is against the community,” Bitfury CIO Alex Petrov told Bitcoin Magazine. “We support more transaction processing, and the easiest way to do that is just avoiding empty blocks mining.”

Petrov says he has offered to help other mining pools avoid empty blocks since 2014, but many pools only became interested in avoiding empty blocks in late 2015 as Bitcoin had to deal with full blocks for the first time.

Besides being the driving force behind FIBRE, Corallo implemented compact blocks in Bitcoin Core. In his view, a variety of different factors have led to the decline in empty blocks mined on the Bitcoin network. “It's a question of which things have improved block propagation where, and I think there are a lot of things,” he told Bitcoin Magazine. “FIBRE has made a difference, certainly, but also individual pools optimizing their own stacks makes a big difference.”

Empty Blocks Will Continue to Decline

Of course, there are still more relay improvements on the way, so there is no reason to think the number of empty blocks mined on a monthly basis won’t continue to decline in 2017.

“We're making massive strides in relay in Bitcoin Core in 0.13 [and] 0.14, and were miners to upgrade to some of the last-minute improvements going into 0.14 and use FIBRE, we'd see [empty blocks] once a month purely because the time between when one pool finds a block and when the rest have validated it is so short,” said Corallo.

Corallo is currently working with others on a system similar to weak blocks that is point-to-point rather than across the whole network.

For some pools, it takes less than 500 milliseconds to validate a newly mined block. To this point, Corallo stated, “I'm working on decreasing that 500 milliseconds for everyone so even those who do mine empty blocks only do them for shorter periods of time.”

One final point worth mentioning is that the incentive to mine empty blocks declines as transaction fees take over the block reward as the main source of revenue for miners. A miner will only want to mine a block with transactions in it if the fees associated with those transactions are the source of revenue.",Technical,-0.9981
2017/1/25, A Closer Look at Bitcoin Unlimited’s Configurable Block Size Proposal,"Bitcoin Unlimited, one of the Bitcoin Core software forks introduced in late 2015, garnered much attention in recent months. The project gained hash power support from several new Bitcoin mining pools, including ViaBTC, GBMiners and BTC.TOP, while node adoption appears to be on the rise as well.

The central idea behind Bitcoin Unlimited — specified in “Bitcoin Unlimited Improvement Proposal 001” (BUIP001) — is to hand control of Bitcoin’s block size limit to users and miners. Or perhaps more accurately: to make this control more explicit and easier to handle.

Here’s how.

The Proposal

The Bitcoin protocol, as enforced by economically relevant nodes, currently includes a one-megabyte block size limit. If a miner were to create a block larger than one megabyte, that block would be considered invalid. It would not become part of Bitcoin’s blockchain, and the miner that mined it would have wasted its resources producing it.

BUIP001 — drafted by Bitcoin Unlimited lead developer Andrew Stone — disposes of the one-megabyte block size limit protocol rule entirely, and replaces it with three configurable options. Two of these are configurable by all node operators, which include regular users as well as miners. And a third option is only for miners.

These configurations are signaled to the Bitcoin network. Regular users broadcast their preferences to other nodes, and miners embed their preferences in the blocks they mine.

Option 1: Maximum Generation Size, or “MG”

First, there is the Maximum Generation Size, also referred to as “MG.” This option is for miners only and is fairly straightforward: it lets miners set the size of blocks they produce. The default setting is one megabyte: It doesn’t automatically diverge from the current Bitcoin protocol. But if a miner wants to create a two-megabyte block, it’s as simple as “flipping a switch” in Bitcoin Unlimited’s user interface. If a miner wants to produce an eight-megabyte block, it’s the same switch.

(The only limits left are limits on message length, which Bitcoin Unlimited set at 160 megabytes. And eventually data type limits or machine resource limits.)

MG gives miners full control over the size of blocks they produce. But of course, as explained above, a two-megabyte block would be rejected by the network right now.

That’s where the second configurable option comes in.

Option 2: Excessive Block Size, or “EB”

The Excessive Block Size, typically referred to as “EB,” determines the size of blocks that nodes and miners accept. If a miner produces a two-megabyte block, that block will be accepted by all nodes and miners that set EB to at least two megabytes.

EB is set at sixteen megabytes by default and is configurable by both normal users and miners. But it is an especially important configuration for miners: miners only mine on top of blocks they accept. A miner that maintains Bitcoin’s current one-megabyte block size limit will reject a two-megabyte block, to instead keep mining on the last one-megabyte block. A miner that sets EB to two megabytes, however, will immediately mine on top of that same two-megabyte block, regardless of what the rest of the network does.

Of course, this also presents a problem.

If a minority of miners sets EB to one megabyte, and a majority of miners sets EB to, say, two megabytes, the network could split in two. As soon as anyone mines a two-megabyte block, a minority of miners will ignore it, and instead continue to extend the one-megabyte chain. The majority of miners, however, will accept the chain with the two-megabyte block, and extend that chain.

Different groups of miners would consider different chains valid, and mine on top of their “own” chain while ignoring the other chain. This split could technically last forever without the two chains ever converging, in effect splitting Bitcoin into two different networks and currencies.

In an attempt to resolve this, Bitcoin Unlimited introduces the third configurable option.

Option 3: Excessive Acceptance Depth, or “AD”

Excessive Acceptance Depth, or “AD,” essentially overrules EB. More specifically, AD determines the number of added confirmations a block requires, before nodes and miners accept it regardless of that block’s size. The default is four.

So, let’s say a node sets EB to two megabytes, and AD to four added confirmations. If that node receives a three-megabyte block, it will initially ignore that block since it exceeds its two-megabyte EB. But if a majority of miners does not ignore that block, and mines four new blocks on top of it, the node’s two-megabyte EB is overruled by its four AD confirmations. The three-megabyte block is retroactively accepted as valid.

As such, different miners (and nodes) should — eventually — converge on a single valid chain, even if they have different MG and EB settings.

Last, it’s worth briefly mentioning the “sticky gate.” If a node’s AD is hit, that node will accept subsequent blocks of any size for about 24 hours (144 blocks). This sticky gate ensures that miners immediately build on the chain with the newly accepted bigger blocks, and not continuously lag behind on the rest of the network, while waiting for each block to reach sufficient AD.

2017/1/27, How Bitcoin Unlimited Users May End Up on Different Blockchains,"Bitcoin Unlimited, one of the Bitcoin Core software forks introduced in late 2015, garnered much attention in recent months. The project gained hash power support from several new Bitcoin mining pools, including ViaBTC, GBMiners and BTC.TOP, while node adoption appears to be on the rise as well.

The central idea behind Bitcoin Unlimited — specified in “Bitcoin Unlimited Improvement Proposal 001” (BUIP001) — is to hand control of Bitcoin’s block size limit to users and miners. Or perhaps, more accurately, to make this control more explicit and easier to handle.

However, this control does come at the expense of Bitcoin’s strong and automated consensus mechanism. With BUIP001, there is a number of scenarios in which different users end up on different chains — either temporarily or permanently.

Here’s a (probably incomplete) overview.

(Note: If you are not sure how Bitcoin Unlimited works, do make sure to first read “A Closer Look at Bitcoin Unlimited’s Configurable Block Size Proposal.”)

If Not Everyone Switches to Bitcoin Unlimited

The first example is also the most obvious one.

It currently seems very unlikely that different Bitcoin implementations — like Bitcoin Core, Libbitcoin, BTCD or Bcoin — will adopt BUIP001, or something compatible. This is especially true because the Bitcoin Unlimited team has not submitted BUIP001 to the cross-implementation Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process; most implementations therefore don’t even have the proposal under consideration.

But if not all significant Bitcoin implementations adopt BUIP001 or a compatible solution, the blockchain cannot converge in the way Bitcoin Unlimited proponents envisage. Instead, if a majority of miners (by hash power) increases Maximum Generation Size (MG) and Excessive Block Size (EB) to produce blocks bigger than one megabyte, Bitcoin would split into two incompatible networks and currencies, not unlike Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.

However, because this split would not be coordinated or include safety precautions, the consequences could be much worse than the split between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.

One megabyte users would experience inconveniences, and even more so if their hash power initially represents a smaller minority. This would include (much) slower block confirmations, perhaps even to the point where their chain becomes almost unusable (at least temporarily). Additionally, they are at risk of replay attacks if they want to use the “Bitcoin Unlimited chain” as well.

Bitcoin Unlimited users would suffer similar inconveniences, though their initial block confirmations wouldn’t be as slow, as they’d have support from the hash-power majority.

To counter that, however, Bitcoin Unlimited users would be unsure as to whether “their” chain would continue to exist at all. If the one megabyte chain should ever overtake the “Bitcoin Unlimited chain” in length (really: total proof of work), Bitcoin Unlimited nodes would automatically switch back to the one megabyte chain. Accordingly, they would dispose of (“orphan”) the entire “Bitcoin Unlimited chain” since the split, even if that chain is thousands of blocks deep. All “their” transactions would be forgotten, perhaps costing lots of people lots of money.

If a group of hardcore one-megabyte supporters and speculators can make this scenario seem even slightly plausible, self-fulfilling prophecy dynamics can pose an existential threat to the “Bitcoin Unlimited chain”: no one wants to hold value on the chain that may be discarded.

If Everyone Does Switch to Bitcoin Unlimited

But let’s assume the switch to BUIP001 goes smoothly. All significant Bitcoin implementations adopt the new configurable options, and all users and miners update their software accordingly.

Once again — even in this scenario — there is no technical reason that all users will converge on a single chain in a meaningful way. Different users can configure their nodes to remain out of consensus for the rest of their lives.

As a simple example, a minority of miners can configure both MG and EB to one megabyte, while they set Excessive Acceptance Depth (AD) to 10,000,000. In other words, these nodes will mimic the current one-megabyte block size limit for about two centuries — regardless of what the rest of the network does.

Meanwhile, a majority of miners can set MG and EB to create and accept blocks up to two megabytes.

Now, as soon as one miner mines a two-megabyte block, the majority of miners will build on this block and extend this chain. The minority of miners, however, ignores this chain practically forever: exactly as described in the previous section of this article.

And it would include the same risks as previously described as well. If the one-megabyte chain ever overtakes the two-megabyte chain in length, the two-megabyte chain is completely discarded. Even after thousands of blocks.

If Everyone Limits AD to Four Confirmations

Bitcoin Unlimited users can have a stronger degree of convergence on a single chain by technical means, if they keep their AD setting relatively low. The default setting in Bitcoin Unlimited is four: An excessive block requires four blocks mined on top of it to be considered valid.

But this presents problems as well.

The first problem is that even with this low default, any transaction with less than five confirmations is much less secure than it is now. Say a transaction shows three confirmations in a user’s wallet. That user has no way of knowing whether an alternative blockchain is being mined with a competing (double-spent) transaction, that already has four confirmations. This could happen at any time.

If that alternative chain reaches its fifth confirmation first, the user’s chain is discarded, and his incoming transaction lost — even though it had three confirmations.

Of course, “orphaned blocks” do already exist, and users that require more security should wait for more confirmations.

But barring exotic and expensive types of malicious attacks, three orphaned blocks can currently really only result from freak coincidence. Different groups of miners must coincidentally find three blocks at almost exactly the same time, three separate and subsequent coincidences, in order for the network to experience that many orphans.

Bitcoin Unlimited, on the other hand, throws a new factor into the mix, adding a reason for the network to experience three orphaned blocks. Miners not only race to extend the longest valid chain, but also vote on protocol rules between chains. This process would also be visible and quite predictable for attackers, and therefore easily exploitable.

The second problem is that having to keep AD at the default of four confirmations for security reasons essentially defeats the purpose of BUIP001. While Bitcoin Unlimited is supposed to hand control of the block size limit over to both users and (all) miners, low AD levels ensure that even the slightest majority of miners can always overrule local block size settings by simply mining a series of bigger blocks. This makes MG and EB meaningless for everyone else: “placebo controls.”

Indeed, AD proposes an odd choice: Either nodes and miners set a high AD for relative autonomy, but risk splitting the network with potentially harmful consequences; or these nodes and miners pick a low AD to improve the level of convergence — but only because they effectively give up control to a majority of miners. (And if the intention is to give up control to a majority of miners, there are more straightforward solutions available.)

Under Adversarial Conditions

Things get worse under adversarial conditions.

If not everyone wants what’s best for Bitcoin, and instead some entities — for whatever reason — would rather see Bitcoin fail, the security assumptions of BUIP001 degrade further. And the more funds an adversary has at its disposal to cause turmoil, the worse Bitcoin Unlimited’s convergence mechanism would perform.

First off, node signaling is trivially spoofed. Anyone with the resources to spin up “fake” (economically irrelevant) nodes could pretend that there is widespread user support for a certain block size limit level, while in reality there is not. If miners go by these signals, they may fork the chain with less user support than expected.

Additionally, a malicious miner can often split the network. Such a miner could monitor the EB levels signaled by other miners (which is not as easily spoofed), and intentionally mine a block that falls right in between what these miners will accept. If some 50 percent of hash power accepts blocks up to two megabytes, and the other 50 percent supports bigger blocks, a 2.01 megabyte block would be ignored by the first 50 percent, and accepted by the other 50 percent.

Assuming the default AD of four is maintained, the chain could split for more than an hour. As explained in the previous section, the Bitcoin network(s) would be very unreliable during this period, as the chain on either side of the split may be discarded.

An adversary controlling only 0.7 percent of global hash power could cause this level of turmoil about once every day. And unless the overwhelming majority of miners already agree on their EB anyways, that sweet spot to abuse the network should always exist.

Furthermore, as a result of this attack, half of all miners would reach their AD thresholds, opening their “sticky gates."" This may allow for a second wave of attacks. Now, the malicious miner has about 24 hours to mine an even larger block, that — ironically — only the initially smaller-block side of the chain would accept because their sticky gates are open, and the initially larger-block side of the chain would reject. This would create another split.

Last, if and when this new ""sticky gate chain"" reaches the AD thresholds of the remaining nodes, all sticky gates are open, and there is no block size limit at all. An adversary can now mine blocks that are so big they may fragment the chain as not all nodes can keep up — perhaps due to bandwidth constraints, latency or other machine limits. 

Emergent Consensus

While Bitcoin Unlimited arguably offers more personal autonomy to users, it does not ensure technical blockchain convergence. But this is not new. To some extent, it is even touched on in Bitcoin Unlimited’s FAQ.

Yet, Bitcoin Unlimited proponents do expect users to converge on a single blockchain. This is explained by what is perhaps best considered Bitcoin Unlimited’s underlying philosophy: “Emergent Consensus.”

Rather than a purely technical mechanism, Emergent Consensus is a conviction that all participants in the Bitcoin ecosystem have a strong enough (economic) incentive to find consensus on a single blockchain, even if their software does not do this automatically.

The next article will take a closer look at this Emergent Consensus philosophy.

Author’s note: This article is not a complete overview of all the problems that could result from BUIP001. Most importantly, it ignores trade-offs and weaknesses that derive from an oversized (or floating) block size limit itself, like node centralization, miner centralization, or fee economics, to instead focus on (a lack of) blockchain convergence.

But as explained in “How Bitcoin Unlimited Users May End Up on Different Blockchains,” BUIP001 does not include a technical consensus mechanism as reliable as in Bitcoin’s current consensus rules.

Instead, Bitcoin Unlimited relies on a philosophy often referred to as “Emergent Consensus.”

(Note: If you are not sure how Bitcoin Unlimited works, or what the technical weaknesses of BUIP001 are, make sure to first read “A Closer Look at Bitcoin Unlimited’s Configurable Block Size Proposal” and “How Bitcoin Unlimited Users May End Up on Different Blockchains.”)

“Emergent Consensus”

BUIP001 does not ensure machine consensus; users can configure their nodes to split into different blockchains, either intentionally or unintentionally. Instead, Bitcoin Unlimited relies on “Emergent Consensus.” This is a conviction that participants in the Bitcoin ecosystem have a strong enough economic incentive to converge on a single blockchain, such that they will converge on a single blockchain. If their software does not automatically realize this, users are expected to configure their settings to make it happen. After all, it benefits everyone to be on the same blockchain and to be able to transact with one another.

How this Emergent Consensus should form is not really documented, however. While some have made analogies — with flocks of birds, for example — it’s not clear how these apply to Bitcoin, exactly.

That said, it is possible to draw out a scenario that many Bitcoin Unlimited proponents roughly envisage. As a first step, users should signal what size of blocks they will accept with the Excessive Block Size (EB) setting. Then, miners — incentivized to satisfy market demand — should increase (or decrease) the block size limit accordingly. Finally, if these new blocks exceed some users’ EB, these users are expected to follow regardless, either because their Excessive Acceptance Depth (AD) setting is triggered, or maybe because they’ll reconfigure their nodes manually.

As explained in “How Bitcoin Unlimited Users May End Up on Different Blockchains,” this scenario does present some problems. For one, if a user’s EB signaling is trivially spoofed by an adversary, miners can be tricked into thinking a block size limit increase has more support than it does — or perhaps malicious miners can themselves trick users.

And for the (remaining) users, this scenario presents an odd choice: Either they set their AD settings low to remain in consensus, but essentially give up much of their autonomy to miners; or they set their AD settings high to protect their autonomy, but risk splitting the network.

Off-Chain Coordination

To counter some of the problems described, Emergent Consensus can also be established through debate on forums, blog posts, chat rooms and other media. Realistically, it may even require this kind of off-chain coordination, to some extent.

For example, while mining pool ViaBTC wants to hard fork to a two-megabyte block size limit, that is not what the pool is currently signaling with its EB settings. If it did, that could be abused to split the network. Instead, ViaBTC signals support for one megabyte and in their “miner guide” proposes to hard fork to two megabytes once at least 75 percent of hash power acknowledges support.

However, this kind of off-chain coordination is not unique. Groups of people have coordinated and achieved consensus through discourse for a long time. But such systems often either have a leader or tend to break down and split into factions once the number of participants reaches a certain size. Other popular open-source projects, for example, sometimes consist of hundreds of incompatible forks.

And this is probably even more true under adversarial conditions. If the people in these groups don’t really know or trust one another, they have no way of knowing whether the other people are telling the truth or lying. Even a single adversary can pretend to be many users and communicate many false preferences. This makes coordination and reaching consensus a very difficult problem to solve.

In fact, this is the Byzantine Generals’ Problem. That is exactly the problem Satoshi Nakamoto attempted to address.

With a track record of about eight years, Bitcoin’s main technological achievement is a math-based protocol that realizes strong, fast, scalable and automated machine consensus for large groups of people who do not necessarily know or trust one another. Bitcoin is reasonably “Byzantine Fault tolerant.”

Bitcoin Unlimited proponents believe that Bitcoin’s economic incentives — the incentive for users to all remain part of the same Bitcoin blockchain — is in itself sufficiently Byzantine Fault tolerant. But that is, so far, largely unproven. No altcoin relies on similar assumptions, nor is there a publicly available testnet where the BUIP001 configurations are actively used.

What Bitcoin Unlimited Changes

That said, part of the same Bitcoin Unlimited philosophy is that Bitcoin relies on a sort of Emergent Consensus anyway.

Rather than merely relying on math, code or protocol, many really see Bitcoin as a consensus between people first and foremost. People choose to partake in the system, people give it value, and sometimes — like during the August 2010 and March 2013 blockchain forks — people have to coordinate “off-chain” to determine which chain is valid.


As such, BUIP001 doesn’t fundamentally change anything. Users choose to run Bitcoin Unlimited. Node software can already be (re-)compiled. And a social consensus may have to form “off-chain” either way.

But by making this control more explicit and easier to handle, and assuming users actually use these options, Bitcoin Unlimited does rely on the human consensus aspect to a much larger extent. Rather than opting into a protocol once and relying on machine consensus from then on, users need to take on a much more proactive role. As one Bitcoin Unlimited proponent noted, shortly after miners had to reconfigure their nodes in response to a bug that briefly forked the network earlier this week: “This IS part of how Bitcoin works. It’s not meant for people sleeping at the wheel.”

It is true that BUIP001 doesn’t introduce anything that wasn’t possible before. As an open-source project, users and miners could always recompile their Bitcoin software to do anything that Bitcoin Unlimited allows. But of course, that in itself is not an argument in favor of BUIP001. Just because users could, that does not mean they should.

So far, Bitcoin has had several forks that lasted for several blocks, caused by technical failures. The August 2010 blockchain fork was needed to revert the creation of billions of bitcoins out of thin air, which required orphaning an hour-long chain. The only reason that the event wasn’t catastrophic is that bitcoin was hardly used as money back then. During the March 2013 blockchain fork, however, the network was unreliable for real users, and at least one person was double-spent, while several miners wasted valuable resources mining an orphaned chain. The same is true for the July 2015 blockchain fork, where miners were urged to switch to fully validating mining pools, and many have learned from that mistake.

Indeed, developers, miners and the rest of the Bitcoin community have generally tried to avoid these types of crisis events as much as they possibly can.

In contrast, Bitcoin Unlimited seems to embrace them as an upgrade mechanism.

2017/2/10,"Better Bitcoin Privacy, Scalability: Developers Making TumbleBit a Reality","TumbleBit is probably one of the most promising technological advancements built on top of Bitcoin to date. Not only does it offer one of the best — if not the best — privacy related innovations so far, it can also provide significant scaling benefits as a payment hub. The solution is also fully compatible with the current Bitcoin protocol and, most important, it is in an advanced stage of development.

“The prospect is good that before summer we will have software that regular users can safely use,” one of TumbleBit’s inventors, Ethan Heilman, told Bitcoin Magazine.

NTumbleBit

TumbleBit has made a good deal of progress in little time. The idea was first proposed last summer by Heilman, Leen AlShenibr, Foteini Baldimtsi, Alessandra Scafuro and Sharon Goldberg. The group of university researchers also coded up a proof of concept and even made successful test transactions on Bitcoin’s blockchain. Shortly after, in September, Heilman and AlShenibr presented their proposal at Scaling Bitcoin Milan, where it was very well received: enthusiasts even made two different trailers celebrating the innovation.

Inspired by its potential, author of the book “Programming The Blockchain in C#” and NBitcoin developer Nicolas Dorier started working on his own implementation of TumbleBit in the C# programming language, called NTumbleBit.

“His work is very impressive, so we decided to move over to it, and NTumbleBit is now the official TumbleBit implementation,” Heilman explained. “Much progress has been made over the past months, and we are now working to ensure that the software is as secure as it can be, and as tested as it can be. We are also building the operational tools necessary for it to be deployed in production.”

TumbleBit merges several cryptographic tricks to allow for a completely trustless coin mixing service. In “Classic Tumbler mode,” all users connect through a central TumbleBit server and send coins to one another in such a way that everyone receives as much as they sent. Using a series of clever cryptographic tricks, this is done so no one can steal coins and no one knows who’s sending bitcoins to whom, not even the central server. Hundreds of users can participate at the same time, thereby obfuscating blockchain trails and, in turn, vastly improving Bitcoin privacy for everyone involved.

Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Dorier explained how this is done with his NTumbleBit implementation.

“Users will need to use a Bitcoin Core full node as a wallet; pruning mode is fine, so they don’t need to store the entire blockchain,” he said. “Then, the NTumbleBit client slowly drains all the coins from the wallet, and connects to the NTumbleBit server to mix them. Completely different coins are returned to the user, preferably to an HD public key for light wallets, though the Bitcoin Core wallet is an option too. The whole process can take a couple of hours depending on the amount to mix, but then everyone will have a completely different batch of coins.”

Dorier completed a first iteration of the NBitcoin software and has stepped back from active development.

Usability

Now, others are picking up where Dorier left off.

As an important next step, the co-author of Dorier’s C# Bitcoin book, Ficsór Ádám, traveled to Tokyo — where Dorier lives — to help with Tor integration.

Anonymizing through Tor may be needed to ensure that the NTumbleBit server can operate as a hidden service. Not all regulators will be very happy with the existence of such a coin mixing tool, and it is possible TumbleBit server operators may encounter trouble when providing the service. (This is also one of the reasons Dorier hasn’t tested the implementation on main net himself, and is instead sticking to testnet.)

But Tor integration is also very much required for TumbleBit to work as advertised, at least in Classic Tumbler mode, Ádám explained.

“In Classic Tumbler mode, everyone is effectively sending bitcoins to themselves,” he said. “Everyone receives new bitcoins, so it breaks the blockchain links. But if everyone communicates with the TumbleBit server through their own IP addresses, that server can easily re-establish the link: it can simply link the IP addresses of sending and receiving Bitcoin addresses and conclude it’s the same person. That’s solved with Tor.”

And then, of course, TumbleBit must actually be made usable — and not only usable for command-line techies, but for regular users as well. After all, the greater the number of people who use TumbleBit, the greater the number of Bitcoin addresses that get mixed together. This increases the anonymity set and therefore benefits everyone’s privacy, including that of command-line techies.

This step is being realized by Dan Gould. An undergraduate at Boston University, Gould is working on a graphic user interface for NTumbleBit. This user interface should make mixing coins with TumbleBit as easy as clicking a button.

All in all, Heilman expects that the first working and usable release of NTumbleBit may be available within months.

“It’s hard to say with certainty, but many of the pieces are in place, and there should be even more people working on NTumbleBit in March, including myself and Leen,” he said.

Payment Hub

Finally, TumbleBit is capable of more than just increasing privacy.

TumbleBit in Classic Tumbler mode may be the best mixing solution for Bitcoin so far (ValueShuffle is another candidate). But in “Payment Hub mode,” a TumbleBit server can, indeed, act as a payment hub. Not unlike the lightning network, this allows users to transact with other users “off-chain” for an extended period of time. If both a customer and a merchant are connected to the TumbleBit server, for example, the customer can make a payment in bitcoin, while neither the customer nor the merchant (nor the tumbler) learn anything about each other’s Bitcoin addresses.

“While we have no timelines yet, we are definitely building Payment Hub mode as well,” Heilman acknowledged. “But our first goal is Classic Tumbler mode; that is 95 percent of the work from a coding perspective.”

And, as with so many of Bitcoin’s tech innovations, TumbleBit could also benefit from Segregated Witness (“SegWit”). The protocol upgrade proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team would solve Bitcoin’s long-standing malleability bug; however, adoption of the proposal currently seems uncertain.

“SegWit is an across-the-board win for anything doing anything with payment channels,” Heilman said. “The biggest advantages are for TumbleBit in Payment Hub mode, as it would allow for more flexibility in payments and an overall smoother user experience. If SegWit happens, then some of the research I'm working on now to improve TumbleBit will happen on Bitcoin. If SegWit doesn't happen, TumbleBit will still happen exactly as we planned, but my further research will probably target Litecoin or other coins with malleability fixes.”",Technical,0.4404
2017/2/15,How Satoshi Messed Up His Math (and How These Academics Just Fixed It),"Satoshi Nakamoto’s math doesn’t quite add up.

In chapter 11 of the Bitcoin white paper, the pseudonymous author explained that an honest mining majority will always outrun a dishonest minority. As a key innovation in digital currency, this ensures transactions are practically irreversible once they have sufficient confirmations, effectively solving the double-spend problem.

However, as first explained by Israeli mathematician Meni Rosenfeld back in 2012, Satoshi made some simplified assumptions. While Bitcoin mining is a random process, Satoshi did not fully take into account that honest miners can be just as lucky or unlucky as dishonest miners can.

Cyril Grunspan, mathematician at École Supérieure d'Ingénieurs Léonard de Vinci, and Ricardo Pérez-Marco, mathematician at the French National Center for Scientific Research, now have taken this randomness into account. The two Parisians published a new paper, finally correcting Satoshi’s “mistake.”

“Satoshi wrongly assumed that honest miners use exactly as much time to find a block as they would on average,” Grunspan told Bitcoin Magazine. “However, this is actually a rough approximation of reality, since the time used by honest miners to mine a block is not deterministic. Therefore, the distribution of the number of blocks mined by the attacker is actually — what is called — a ‘negative binomial distribution.’ Not the assumed ‘Poisson law.’”

In essence, the Bitcoin white paper assumes that two factors are needed to calculate how irreversible a transaction is. Satoshi rightly assumed that the share of total hash power available to the attacker is one factor: as an attacker controls more hash power, more confirmations are needed. And Satoshi rightfully assumed that the number of confirmations is another factor: the more confirmations a transaction has, the more secure it is.

Grunspan and Pérez-Marco now show how a third factor comes into play: the deviation from average mining time — “luck” — the honest miners have in finding blocks. If they are very lucky, and find blocks faster than the average, their chain will probably be further ahead; the attacker will have had less time to secretly mine an alternative chain. On the other hand, if the honest miners are unlucky and find blocks slower than the average, they will probably be less far ahead: thus, the attacker will have had more time to mine an alternative chain.

What This Means

The good news, as now conclusively shown by Grunspan and Pérez-Marco, is that the basic premise of the white paper still holds up. Bitcoin works as intended.

“In this paper, we show that the probability of double spends drops exponentially to zero as the honest mining majority finds more blocks,” Grunspan said. In other words, it becomes increasingly difficult for minority attackers to catch up and overtake the honest majority.

That said, the security assumptions as stated in the white paper need to be tweaked a little. Rather than just accounting for the amount of hash power an attacker has and the number of blocks the attacker is behind, this third factor must also be considered. In their paper, Grunspan and Pérez-Marco have now published exactly how much this matters.

“This is interesting information that can be used by merchants to monitor risk,” Grunspan said on the relevancy of their calculations. “Let’s say a merchant always waits for six confirmations before sending his goods to a customer, as that is the level of risk he is comfortable with. That’s 60 minutes on average. But sometimes he’ll have to wait for two hours before six blocks are found. If that happens, the double-spend risk is also higher. So for the same level of security, he’ll actually have to wait for a seventh confirmation. While if the confirmations come in much faster, he should be fine even with five confirmations.”

As double-spend protection is arguably at the heart of Bitcoin’s innovation, the mathematical simplification in Satoshi’s work is notable, especially for mathematicians. Grunspan does allow, however, that simplifying assumptions in a white paper is also understandable.

And, perhaps, it reveals another hint about Bitcoin’s origins.

“Satoshi was a genius,” concluded Grunspan. “But he was not a mathematician.”",Technical,-0.34
2017/2/24,Bitcoin’s Capacity Increase from Segregated Witness Could Kick in Fast,"Segregated Witness (SegWit) is a proposed soft-forking change to the Bitcoin protocol that, among other things, increases capacity of the network. In addition to an estimated doubling of the block size limit, SegWit is also viewed as a key improvement for layer-two solutions such as the lightning network and TumbleBit.

One of the key criticisms of SegWit up to this point has been the fact that the increased capacity enabled by this upgrade is not implemented as soon as the change is activated; however, it’s now looking much more likely that SegWit could offer a nice bump in capacity shortly after activation.

It should be noted that this critique of SegWit’s increase in the block size limit looks at Bitcoin only from a bird’s-eye view. On an individual user basis, the benefits of increased capacity are seen as soon as the user upgrades. In other words, it’s unclear if the “slow” nature of SegWit’s increase to the block size limit on a macro level even matters.

Why Segregated Witness Is Not an Instant Block Size Limit Increase

The reason that it was originally thought that Segregated Witness would not offer much in terms of increased capacity right out of the gate is that wallets, exchanges and other creators of transactions must also complete their own upgrades before the benefits of SegWit could be seen on the network.

Since each user must effectively opt in to the increased capacity offered by SegWit, the growth in capacity would be seen when users start using SegWit transactions rather than when the protocol change is initially activated.

It should be noted that some Bitcoin Core contributors have downplayed the amount of time it would take for service providers to implement SegWit-related changes into their own software.

Another common argument against the capacity increase offered by SegWit has been that none of the in-progress lightning networks are ready for production use. While there aren’t any bitcoin wallet providers that have implemented lightning payments in their own software, Lightning Labs did recently release an alpha version of their lightning network daemon.

Work is also progressing on an implementation of TumbleBit.

Major Wallet Providers Are Ready for Segregated Witness

Since the issue of SegWit’s slow block size limit increase was first raised over a year ago, many different companies and projects in the Bitcoin ecosystem have become SegWit-ready or are at least prepared to implement the change if and when it is nearing activation. Perhaps most notably, Blockchain.info has implemented the necessary changes to allow their users to make SegWit transactions once the change is activated.

He told Bitcoin Magazine that once BitGo has has rolled out new SegWit addresses for their wallets, customers would be able to update their software development kits. At that point, it would just be a matter of their customers spending through the existing non-SegWit UTXOs in their wallets.

“Customers have every incentive to upgrade as it cuts their fees in half,” added Davenport. “And our customers’ wallets are very active, so old outputs would be quickly spent. I estimate BitGo alone could free up about 60 KB more block space.”

With a 1 MB block size limit, 60 KB basically amounts to 6 percent of the maximum potential block size. The effective increase in block space availability would be greater than Davenport’s 6 percent estimate if SegWit transactions were used in that newly freed-up space.

Although BitGo is not yet SegWit ready, Davenport claims the bitcoin wallet provider could make the necessary changes in a matter of weeks. “We haven’t prioritized it, as we see little chance of it activating soon,” he explained.

While Blockchain.info’s impact on SegWit adoption as a creator of a large chunk of total bitcoin transactions is obvious, there’s an added bonus to BitGo’s adoption of the improvement. Due to the way the upgrade works, SegWit’s impact on capacity is increased as more people use multisignature transactions. This is relevant because multisig is essentially BitGo’s bread and butter.

""Although Davenport claims BitGo accounts for roughly 6 to 7 percent of all daily transactions on the Bitcoin network, he estimates that the company also accounts for greater than 80 percent of all multisig transactions.""

Segregated Witness Is Still Awaiting Activation

Of course, SegWit’s activation on the Bitcoin network is far from a done deal. Miner support for the proposed improvement has stagnated at roughly 25 percent, and the current implementation calls for support from 95 percent of the network hashrate.

In recent months, nearly every bitcoin exchange and wallet provider of note has at least stated their intention to implement the necessary changes to prepare for the activation of SegWit, but many mining pool operators have yet to signal support for this change.

2017/3/2,The Latest Twist to the Block Size Debate Is Called a “UASF”,"Just when Bitcoin’s long-lasting scalability dispute appeared to have reached a deadlock, a pseudonymous mailing-list contributor may have presented a way out.

Segregated Witness (SegWit), the Bitcoin protocol upgrade proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team, would roughly double Bitcoin’s block size limit, while laying the groundwork for further scaling solutions. But this proposal that requires 95 percent of hash power support to activate has been slow to gain miner adoption. And there is little indication this will change anytime soon.

Now, there may be an alternative route to activation.

“[T]he signaling methodology is widely misinterpreted to mean the hash power is voting on a proposal and it seems difficult to correct this misunderstanding in the wider community,” a so-far unknown person under the pseudonym “shaolinfry” noted on the Bitcoin-development mailing list and the BitcoinTalk forum last weekend.

And:

“The alternative discussed here is ‘flag day activation’ where nodes begin enforcement at a predetermined time in the future.”

This alternative is called a “user activated soft fork” or “UASF.”

Hash Power Activated Soft Forks

Soft forks are changes to the Bitcoin protocol that tighten up the rules. Transactions or blocks that would have been valid under the old rules become invalid under the new rules.

An interesting property of soft forks is that some users can upgrade to the new set of rules, while other users do not, or at least, not yet. They would all remain part of the same network, use the same blockchain and transact in the same currency; it’s just that some users may be looking at slightly different data.

“Soft forks are backwards compatible and opt-in,” shaolinfry argued in a follow-up email. “So long as they are well written and bug free, users should, at worst, be agnostic towards them because they have a choice whether to safely use the new feature or not, without preventing others’  enjoyment of the feature.”

Over the past couple of years, soft forks were mostly implemented by hash power activation. This utilizes the fact that miners decide which valid transactions they include in blocks anyway. A majority of miners can reject certain types of transactions and blocks from the blockchain if they violate the new soft fork rules, even transactions that “old nodes” would still consider valid.

Segregated Witness as proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team is a soft fork. But with this soft fork proposal in particular, hash power activation seems to be approached as something akin to an election.

Which, shaolinfry argued, it is not:

“[A] problem with supermajority hash power signaling is it draws unnecessary attention to miners which can become unnecessarily political. Already misunderstood as a vote, miners may feel pressure to ‘make a decision’ on behalf of the community: who is and isn’t signaling becomes a huge public focus and may put pressures onto miners they are unprepared for.”

The alternative, shaolinfry therefore proposed, is to introduce UASFs as an activation method.

UASF

The concept of a UASF is actually even more straightforward than a hash power activated soft fork.

Rather than miners, it’s the Bitcoin economy — individual users, merchants, exchanges, wallet providers and other economic actors — that activates the soft fork with the software they run. At a specific point in time, the Bitcoin economy tightens up the rules of the system, activating the soft fork. From that point on, everyone simply rejects transactions and blocks that break the new rules.

Realistically, the miners would then have to follow the new rules as well, or at least take certain safety precautions to avoid accepting invalid blocks and transactions. If they don’t, they risk producing blocks the economy deems invalid and rejects. The miners would not be able spend the coins they earned in the block reward, deposit them at an exchange nor otherwise use them. For all intents and purposes, they would not have earned bitcoins at all, and instead wasted resources producing a worthless block.

To earn a block reward that has actual value, miners will therefore need to do what the economy wants them to do, shaolinfry argued:

“The hash powers’ role is to select valid transactions, and to extend the blockchain with valid blocks. Fully validating economic nodes ensure that blocks are valid. Nodes therefore define validity according to the software they run, but miners decide what already valid transactions get included in the [blockchain].”

Like all soft forks, a UASF would still be an opt-in proposition for regular users, assuming it activates smoothly. If some users don’t like SegWit, for example, they can choose not to upgrade. Meanwhile, other users can enjoy the benefits SegWit offers.

Drawbacks

While the concept of a UASF is straightforward, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s easy to pull off. Compared to hash power activated soft forks, UASFs introduce two increased risks. And not unlike hard forks, if things go badly, Bitcoin can split into two incompatible networks, blockchains and currencies.

The first risk is that coordination can be difficult. Most important, it’s hard to know for sure whether a UASF is really backed, and will be enforced, by the economy. Support from centralized services — exchanges, wallet providers, payment processors — can perhaps be gauged, but individual Bitcoin nodes are trivially spoofed. And if only a minority of the economy enforces the new rules and a majority enforces the original rules, Bitcoin would split in two.

Second, even if a significant majority of the economy does enforce the soft fork, a determined (or perhaps very lazy) majority of miners can still frustrate the upgrade. If these miners are willing and able to waste energy mining the “old” chain, any non-upgraded user would follow this “miner chain,” rather than the valuable “economy chain.” This user would be susceptible to double-spends, at least for as long as these miners are willing and able to waste resources.

That said, these risks are bigger with hard forks, and similar problems can occur even with hash power activated soft forks, as the BIP66 blockchain split showed.

As noted by shaolinfry:

“Validation has always had a strong requirement.”",Technical,-0.4404
2017/3/7,Guest Post: Chain Splits and Resolutions,"An often misunderstood topic is that of chain splits and how they are potentially resolved. With the recent proposal from Shaolinfry discussing User Activated Soft Forks (UASF) getting much attention, these misunderstandings must be clarified to fully understand the implications of chain splits and their potential resolutions.

Types of Forks

Miners can create chain splits through the deliberate orphaning of blocks that appear to be valid to some clients. Users maintain a set of consensus rules that they require of all blocks. When users disagree about the sets of consensus rules to enforce, they will follow a different chain. To simplify discussion, we’ll skip the case where the consensus rules are agreed upon, but miners decide to orphan blocks for other reasons, and cases where there are more than two sets of consensus rules.

In the following examples, there are two sets of rules, the Red rules and the Yellow rules. In these examples, the Red rules are original rules being enforced, and the Yellow rules are the modified rules. Orange rules are the combination of both Red and Yellow rules (both rule sets agree that these blocks are valid).

Incompatible Hard Fork

An incompatible is the simplest type of chain split to understand. At a certain block height, some users decide to implement a new ruleset. In this case, the new ruleset is completely independent of the original rules.



Incompatible Hard Fork


A hard fork occurs after some miners decide to mine on the new ruleset, and some continue on the old ruleset. No block produced under the new rules is valid under the old rules, and vice versa. The Ethereum/Ethereum Classic split is an example of this kind of split. In this case, the chains are eternally split with no chance of ever converging, no matter how much work is mined into each chain.

Semi-Compatible Hard Forks

A semi-compatible hard fork occurs whenever the rulesets intersect, but there are some blocks that are valid on only one of the chains for each chain.



Semi-Compatible Fork

In these cases, miners can prevent a chain split by mining only Orange rule blocks. However, once a miner mines a Red or Yellow block, the chain splits. It is possible for the chains to converge if miners eventually put together an exclusively Orange chain starting from when the users accepted Yellow rules that surpassed the total work of both of the other chains. If they ever did this, both the Red/Orange and Yellow/Orange chains would be orphaned by Red/Yellow clients, and they would see a single chain. There are no major forks of this type that I am aware of.

The best bet for miners in this case (depending on the specifics) would typically be to just mine Orange blocks, preventing any chain split. By doing so, miners are effectively turning a Semi-compatible fork into a Soft Fork.

Compatible Hard Fork

In a hard fork, the ruleset expands, to include all of the previous rules, but also allowing other conditions.



Hard Fork

When the rules expand, as soon as a miner mines a block with the Yellow rules, the chain splits. This type of split will diverge as long as the Yellow chain contains more work than the Orange chain. One danger in this type of split is that if the Orange chain contains more work, the Yellow chain will be orphaned. Users of the Yellow chain must not only be sure that a vast majority of hashpower will be on this chain initially, but will continue to be on this chain for eternity. Examples of this type of fork include Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited.

Soft Fork

A soft fork is when the ruleset is tightened and the Yellow rules are completely covered by the Red rules (thus only Orange and Red rulesets).



The chain split can occur whenever a miner creates a Red block. Users who use the Red ruleset will follow that chain, and users who use the Yellow ruleset will follow the Orange chain. In this case, if the majority of hashpower ever starts enforcing the Orange rules, the Red chain will become orphaned. This type of fork occurred in Bitcoin’s history numerous times with changes such as BIP66, CSV, CLTV, and is in the proposed SegWit Soft Fork.

Reorganization Risk and Split Risks

Both massive reorganizations and chain splits present dangers to users and miners. A massive reorganization can cause previously accepted transactions to disappear, which will guarantee that a large number of people will lose money in the process.

In this case, for example, perhaps a year ago you were paid 10BTC for your car, and a year later, that transaction essentially disappears from the ledger and your chain is abandoned. You have no car and no Bitcoins. This type of behavior would cause a great loss of confidence in the currency. Depending on the type of split, a massive reorganization will only affect users of the looser ruleset. Users of the tighter ruleset will never get reorganized.

A chain split also presents risk. The value of Ethereum took a tumble after it split from Ethereum Classic. It added confusion to the marketplace (Which is really Ethereum? The one with the original rules, or the one with the rules the centralized Ethereum Foundation enforces today?). A chain split affects all users adversely. There are cases where a split may be preferred (say, two groups have vastly different interests and are best served following their own wants, rather than compromising).

Mitigating Risk

Risk for most of these forks can be mitigated by both miners and users, in most cases.

For an incompatible hard fork, no mitigation plan can occur. The chain IS splitting, so long as some miners and some users want it to. There is nothing that can happen. This is the equivalent of getting a divorce decree and parting ways, never to interact again.

For a semi-compatible soft fork, miners have the power to prevent both a chain fork and massive reorganization. If the majority of miners choose to mine only Orange blocks, users will remain on one chain and reorganizations will be limited to a small number of blocks.

For a compatible hard fork, risk is exclusively on the Yellow rule users. Their best mitigation is to ensure the majority of the economy is on their side. It’s also important to make sure the majority of the miners are also on their side initially, otherwise the chain will not split. Without the majority of the economy, the value of the Orange blocks will be greater, thus pulling miners interested in profit to their side, leading to a massive reorganization.

Extreme care must be taken in this scenario (something that was not present with Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, nor the proposed Bitcoin Unlimited). The former would activate with a mere 75% of hashpower, and Bitcoin Unlimited has no threshold for activation.

For a soft fork, the risk is exclusively on the Red rule users. Their best mitigation strategy is to ensure that they have the economy on their side, and the vast majority of miners following the Red rules OR the vast majority of miners on the Orange rules.

This may seem a bit counterintuitive, but if the vast majority of miners are mining the Orange rules, then they will remain in consensus with the Orange users and will not get Orphaned. Miners can mitigate this by only mining blocks in the Orange set and orphaning the Red set.

Miners have a significant role in mitigating this risk. In every case except the Incompatible Hard Fork, the miners can prevent a chain fork. For the semi-compatible hard fork, they can do this by converting it into a soft fork. For the compatible hard fork, they can only do this by rejecting the hard fork. For the soft fork case, they do this by enforcing the soft fork. However, even without the miners doing this, users have an incentive to protect themselves by enforcing the Orange rules and rejecting anything does not meet them. This means rejecting hard forks and enforcing soft forks.



Epilogue: Escaping a Miner-Imposed Ruleset Change

Many, including Jeff Garzik, have cast suspicion upon soft forks because they do not give users a choice. The nature of Bitcoin and other Proof-of-Work based blockchains cannot prevent miners from enforcing stricter rules than users agree to. However, users do have power  —  by invoking an incompatible hard fork.

In this case, users will force the chain to split by introducing a new ruleset (which may include a proof-of-work change, but does not require one). This ensures users always have an escape from a miner-imposed ruleset that they reject. This way, if the economy and users truly reject a soft fork rule change, they always have the power to break away and reclaim the rules they wish. It may be inconvenient, but the same is true of any attack by the miners on users.",Technical,-0.9403
2017/3/7,Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 Released: What’s New?,"Today marks the official release of Bitcoin Core 0.14.0, the fourteenth generation of Bitcoin’s original software client launched by Satoshi Nakamoto eight years ago. Overseen by Bitcoin Core lead maintainer Wladimir van der Laan, this latest major release was developed by nearly 100 contributors over a six-month period.

Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 features a significant list of improvements. Compared to some previous releases, however, most of these concern “internals” of the software: performance improvements that take place under the hood but may not be very noticeable for everyday users.

That said, here are some of the more notable changes.

“Assumevalid” Blocks

Whenever a new node bootstraps on the network, it syncs the entire blockchain. It downloads and verifies all blocks that were ever mined, and verifies all transactions in all of these blocks. Unfortunately, this can take quite some time. Even new, high-end laptops often require more than a full day to catch up. For older or lower-grade machines, it takes even longer.

“Assumevalid” significantly speeds up this process. In essence, Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 nodes assume that all transactions up to a certain block are valid. While a syncing node still verifies the proof of work for all blocks, and records the entire transaction history, it no longer checks signatures and similar data for each individual transaction.

The assumption as to which block is valid is configurable. By default, it’s block 453354 for Bitcoin Core 0.14.0. But users who do want to fully verify every single transaction, even those dating years back, still can.

It’s also worth noting that, as opposed to a checkpointing system that establishes that a specific block must be part of the blockchain, the assumed valid block is not necessarily binding. A Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 node will readily switch to an alternative blockchain without the assumed valid block, if that alternative blockchain is longer.

Improved Fee Estimation

As Bitcoin blocks have been filling up, particularly over the last year, not all transactions sent over the network fit into the very next block. As a result, miners usually prioritize transactions that include the most fees. Transactions that include more fees have a higher chance of being included in the very next block or shortly thereafter. Transactions that include lower fees are outbid and take longer to confirm.

Of course, not everyone needs their transactions to confirm as quickly. Users who send bitcoins to an exchange because of rapid price movements may be in a rush to have their transactions confirmed. Meanwhile, users who move bitcoins between their own wallets may be more patient. 

Since Bitcoin Core 0.10.0, users have been able to adjust their fees accordingly. They can manually include higher fees if they are in more of a rush, and lower fees if they are not. Bitcoin Core 0.11.0 and 0.12.0 both refined the fee estimation software, and Bitcoin 0.14.0 now includes another set of improvements, which in particular makes the algorithm more robust in edge case situations. 

Additionally, the default confirmation target was decreased from 25 blocks to 6 blocks; most transactions made from Bitcoin Core should confirm within an hour even if the user doesn’t touch the fee settings.

Opt-In Replace-by-Fee for Sending

In addition to the improved fee estimation, Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 users have another option to speed up their transactions.

First introduced a year ago with the release of Bitcoin Core 0.12.0, Bitcoin transactions can be marked with a “replace-by-fee” flag. Senders of a transaction can replace their initial transaction with a newer transaction that includes a higher fee. This allows them to “skip the line” and have their transaction confirmed faster.

Up until this point, Bitcoin Core only included opt-in replace-by-fee in the node behavior: it accepted and forwarded transactions with replace-by-fee flags (instead of rejecting them as double-spends). But Bitcoin Core users could not utilize opt-in replace-by-fee to bump their own fees; so far only users of wallets like Electrum or GreenAddress could.

Now, opt-in replace-by-fee has been added as a remote procedure call (RPC) option in Bitcoin Core 0.14.0. This means that users working from the command line, or on applications built on Bitcoin Core, can utilize replace-by-fee, too.

Manual Pruning

Bitcoin’s blockchain is over 100 gigabytes in size and at its current rate is growing about 50 gigabytes each year. All that data needs to be stored, which can present a significant burden for users running a full node.

That’s why Bitcoin Core 0.11.0 introduced blockchain pruning. Users can get rid of older blocks once they are verified, so running a full node doesn’t require as much disk space.

But up till now, users could only prune starting from a fixed number of blocks. With pruning set at 1000 blocks, for example, Bitcoin Core kept exactly the latest 1000 blocks. Whenever a new block was added, the oldest block was discarded, to keep the total at 1000.

Unfortunately, this meant that certain applications relying on Bitcoin Core couldn’t really utilize pruning. For example, a payment processing application — for merchants that want to accept bitcoin but prefer not to rely on external services like BitPay or Coinbase — may in some cases need to figure out whether a valid payment was made in an older block. If that block is already pruned, the application can’t do its job.

Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 therefore allows for more specific pruning. Instead of keeping a set number of blocks, users can prune the blockchain starting from a specific point in time, a specific block height, and keep all blocks that were created since.

Combined with another new feature called “importmulti,” Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 can import and timestamp addresses, for example, from the aforementioned payment processing application. Using the timestamps to establish when a specific address was created, Bitcoin Core knows from which point in time blocks are relevant for the application and won’t prune these blocks.

Block Relay Improvements

Whenever a new block is mined, it is transmitted over Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer network, until each node received it. Unfortunately, latency on this network can benefit pooled mining as well as geographic clusters of miners, incentivizing a more centralized mining topology.

Increasing block propagation speed has therefore been a central point of focus for the Bitcoin Core development team for some years now, and Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 includes another batch of improvements.

Perhaps most important, Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 nodes forward blocks to their peers sooner. Where nodes would previously verify a block in its entirety before sending it to connected nodes, Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 starts the forwarding process as soon as the proof of work checks out.

While many miners today do use alternative relay networks as well, increasing speed on Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer network reduces the reliance on these networks and even benefits these relay networks where they connect to the peer-to-peer network.

And …

As mentioned, the improvements listed above are really only the tip of the iceberg. Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 includes a list of additional performance improvements, varying from low-level RPC changes, to changes in the graphical user interface (GUI), and anything in between. For a full overview of all improvements, see the Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 release notes.",Technical,-0.9926
2017/3/9,You Really Should Run a Bitcoin Full Node: Here's Why,"On day one of the 2017 MIT Bitcoin Expo, Sia Co-Founder David Vorick, who has contributed to Bitcoin Core, gave a presentation on the important role played by full nodes in digital currency networks. In his view, economically relevant full nodes are the ones that have “voting” power (for lack of a better term) in attempted hard-forking changes to the rules of Bitcoin.

What Is the Role of the Full Node?

Early in his talk, Vorick focused on the general role played by full nodes on the network. “Full nodes validate transactions on the Bitcoin network,” he stated. “Bitcoin has this longest-chain rule where the chain with the most work in it is the one that everybody follows, except this chain also has to follow all of the rules that the network has. The full nodes are the ones [that] check that the chain follows the rules, and if a chain doesn’t follow the rules, it doesn’t matter how much hashrate is behind it, that chain is ignored.”

According to Vorick, of all the different types of Bitcoin users, full nodes are the only ones that check that the rules are followed. Those who run an SPV node or use some sort of web wallet are putting their trust in others to verify that certain rules are being followed correctly on the most-work chain.

“They’re faster,” Vorick said in terms of SPV nodes. “They download all the headers. They make sure that they are on the chain with the most work, but they don’t actually check that the chain with the most work is legal or is valid.”

Vorick went on to state that SPV nodes are essentially betting that the rest of the network will sufficiently handle the validation process for them.

“SPV nodes just blindly have faith in the broader network to do this process that makes sure that the longest chain is always valid,” Vorick continued. “They don’t actually know. They’re just assuming that the broader network is going to keep them safe.”

Without full nodes, Vorick says, miners are given the ability to do whatever they want. “If people can spend each other’s money [or] if miners can [produce] money out of nowhere, you have a useless system,” he added.

Upgrades in Bitcoin

Vorick also talked about how upgrades are made to the Bitcoin network. When talking about upgrades, he was referring to hard forks specifically. He also referred to soft forks as patches.

“Soft forks don’t actually change the rules; they just are more creative about how they use the rules,” Vorick explained.

In terms of attempted hard forks, Vorick claimed there are three potential outcomes. In one, the hard fork could fail and everyone may decide to ignore the failed chain. Vorick pointed to the recent block larger than 1 million bytes accidentally mined by Bitcoin.com as an example of a failed upgrade.

Another possible outcome from an attempted hard fork is that economic activity continues to take place on both chains. Vorick referred to this as a “partially successful upgrade,” and he used the split between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic as an example of this outcome.

The third possible outcome mentioned by Vorick is a successful hard fork with new rules where the new chain becomes the only chain people use and everyone ignores the old chain. Besides the hard fork that resulted in the split between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, the Ethereum chain has also had multiple successful hard forks.

Economically Relevant Full Nodes Have the Power

When determining the level of success achieved by an attempted upgrade, Vorick claimed that it ultimately comes down to the desires of the full nodes. “If you’re not running a full node, sort of your opinion on whether or not you like a hard fork is less relevant because, ultimately, if you’re not validating the rules and someone gives you a transaction following a different rule set, you don’t have a way to detect that,” he explained. “So you can’t actually weigh in on an attempted hard fork, an attempted upgrade.”

Vorick then compared full nodes to representatives in a democracy; however, he also pointed out that some full nodes are much more economically relevant than others. BitPay, for example, has a bigger say in what happens than a full node sending and receiving one small payment per month.

According to Vorick, users can be dragged along with miners and large businesses if the cost of running a full node is too high. “If full nodes are expensive to run, only people who are capable of running nodes really have any say in what happens in a contentious upgrade,” he added.

As an example, Vorick pointed out that Ethereum Classic may not have ever existed if it cost too much for the original Ethereum chain’s early supporters to run full nodes.

“I would advocate that, right now, full [Bitcoin] nodes are too expensive,” Vorick concluded.",Technical,0.9593
2017/3/15,This Security Researcher Found the Bug That Knocked Out Bitcoin Unlimited,"For over a year, attackers have had the ability to crash Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic nodes. Yesterday, someone actually did it. According to websites like Coin Dance, the number of Bitcoin Unlimited nodes fell sharply from almost 800 to less than 250 in a matter of hours. Bitcoin Classic was hit shortly after.

One day earlier, the security researcher who found the vulnerability had reached out to Bitcoin Magazine.

“I am quite beside myself at how a project that aims to power a $20 billion network can make beginner’s mistakes like this.”

The Vulnerabilities

Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic are forks of Bitcoin Core that intend to increase Bitcoin’s block size limit. Both launched in 2015 and have been maintained by their own development teams since. While Bitcoin Classic was a relatively popular alternative to Bitcoin Core last year, Bitcoin Unlimited has been gaining traction lately. The world’s largest mining pool — AntPool — announced it would switch to Bitcoin Unlimited, as have several smaller pools.

But not everyone believes that is a good idea.

“I am rather dismayed at the poor level of code quality in Bitcoin Unlimited and I suspect there [is] a raft of other issues,” a security researcher identifying herself only as “Charlotte Gardner” told Bitcoin Magazine on Monday.

Communicating over email, Gardner said she was auditing the software for her own use, but quickly came to the conclusion that it’s highly unsafe: “What concerns me is that this software is now being used by a huge portion of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem.”

Gardner revealed that she had submitted two vulnerabilities — “critical remote crash vulnerabilities” to be exact — to the Bitcoin Unlimited development team.

The first one is known as a “NULL pointer dereference,” the second a “reachable assertion.” In both cases, attackers can send especially crafted messages to Bitcoin Unlimited or Bitcoin Classic nodes to make these nodes crash. On an open peer-to-peer network like Bitcoin’s, this means that an attacker can get a list of Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic nodes from publicly available sources, like Bitnodes, and simply knock every single one of them offline.

“I’m surprised no one has noticed them yet,” Gardner told Bitcoin Magazine one day before the attack took place. “I guess not many people actually use the Bitcoin Unlimited software. But with their ‘rise,’ attackers may take more interest.”

The Disclosure

When contacting Bitcoin Magazine on Monday, Gardner did not immediately want to make the vulnerabilities public. That would have been irresponsible, she explained, as the bugs could still be exploited before the Bitcoin Unlimited development team had the chance to fix it.

But she did also submit the vulnerabilities to Mitre’s Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. This ensures that Mitre discloses the bugs in one month from now, which pressures the developers to actually fix the problem in time.

However, even following this responsible disclosure, Gardner thought there was a risk that the vulnerabilities would be abused as soon as they were fixed in the Bitcoin Unlimited code repository. After all, at that point the problem isn’t really solved: anyone running the released Bitcoin Unlimited software is still vulnerable until they download and run the new, revised version. This opens a window for attackers.

“The problem is, the bugs are so glaringly obvious that when fixing it, it will be easy to notice for anyone watching their development process,” she said.

It now appears that is exactly what has happened. While the Bitcoin Unlimited developers did indeed fix the issue shortly after it was pointed out to them, they did so with far too conspicuous a GitHub commit message, Gardner told Bitcoin Magazine once it appeared the bugs seemed fixed and before the attacks began.

“Their commit message does ring alarm bells. I’m not sure if anyone will notice, but they probably should have obfuscated the message a bit more. The wording might attract closer scrutiny. But if it went unnoticed for this long, maybe it will go unnoticed.”

Clearly, it did not.

As Gardner warned, it didn’t take long for attackers to exploit one of the vulnerabilities: the first attacks happened shortly after the bugs were fixed. A little later, user “shinobimonkey” took the issue to Reddit, Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd tweeted about the bug and social media blew up.

Someone then even published exploit code for anyone to use, and before long most Bitcoin Unlimited nodes were down, to be followed by many Bitcoin Classic nodes.

“This is exactly why there is supposed to be a ‘responsible disclosure’ protocol,” Gardner told Bitcoin Magazine after the attacks took place. “But then it doesn’t help if the software project is not discreet about fixing critical issues like this.”

Code Quality

This is not the first time the code quality of Bitcoin Unlimited or Bitcoin Classic has been scrutinized.

As the best-known example, the bitcoin.com mining pool, which runs Bitcoin Unlimited, mined an invalid block caused by a bug last January. All energy invested to produce the block was wasted, while mining pools that spy mined on top of the invalid block wasted some energy as well.

Before that, Bitcoin Core developers had already warned about buggy code on several occasions. On the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Matt Corallo said that he had found Bitcoin Classic’s flexible transactions codebase to be “riddled with blatant and massive security holes.” On Reddit, Gregory Maxwell pointed out that Bitcoin Unlimited nodes were crashing because the development team removed code that shouldn’t have been removed.

Addressing Bitcoin Unlimited lead developer Andrew Stone in response to yesterday’s events, Maxwell suggested there are more problems with Bitcoin Unlimited’s codebase that have not yet been abused:

“There are vulnerabilities in Unlimited which have been privately reported to you in Unlimited by Bitcoin Core folks which you have not acted on, sadly. More severe than this one, in fact.”

Perhaps the main problem for Bitcoin Unlimited, as pointed out by information security expert Andreas Antonopoulos, is that it lacks a significant development community to perform proper quality analysis. The number of developers working on Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic is relatively small, and the code that included the exploited vulnerability was merged after being reviewed by only one person — not a lot for security-critical code protecting people’s money.

Gardner agreed with this assessment:

“In this case, the vulnerabilities are so glaringly obvious, it is clear no one has audited their code because these stick out like a sore thumb,” she said. “I’m astounded the mining industry are running this software. But since they are, and a lot of people could get harmed, the best I can do, other than recommending they don’t use Bitcoin Unlimited, is to disclose the issues and hope they are competent enough to fix it.”

If a majority of miners (by hash power) switch to Bitcoin Unlimited and decide to mine blocks bigger than one megabyte, while at least some users stick to the current Bitcoin protocol, the network and blockchain can split in two. In that case, there may be two different types of Bitcoin tokens: “BTC,” which follows the current Bitcoin protocol, and “BTU,” which follows the new Bitcoin Unlimited protocol.

The good news is that each bitcoin would effectively be copied onto the Bitcoin Unlimited chain. If you hold bitcoin right now, you will hold both BTC and BTU after a split.

The bad news is that a coin-split can be messy and risky. This is mainly because, at first, all BTCs and all BTUs will be stuck together. You will need to separate them somehow; otherwise you can lose your BTC or your BTU.

This guide will provide you with the basics to stay safe during a coin-split, and make sure you make it to the “other side” with both your BTC and BTU intact.

Author’s note: If you want to play the BTC/BTU markets as soon as possible and you are fine with taking risks, and/or you really know what you are doing, this article is probably not for you. (Perhaps try this Electrum article instead.)

If you mostly just want to make sure not to lose your BTC or BTU, read on …

Before the Coin-Split (That’s Now)
First of all, be aware that a coin-split is a high-risk situation. There is a real chance a sort of cyber-battle will break out between the two camps, perhaps even escalating to the point where bitcoin’s exchange rate(s) drops sharply, possibly to zero. Make absolutely sure you are not holding more value in bitcoin than what you are willing to lose.

If you do decide to hold on to your bitcoins, the single most important piece of advice is this: control your own private keys.

If you are storing your bitcoins on an exchange, in a custodial wallet like Coinbase, Circle or Xapo, or on any other service that holds your private keys for you, you may or may not eventually receive coins on both ends of the chain. Several exchanges have so far suggested you may but have made no guarantees. And at least one exchange, GDAX, has explicitly indicated you may not.

If you’re using any of these kinds of services to store your bitcoins, you need to create your own wallet. Send your bitcoins to this new wallet; this wallet now holds your private keys.

What kind of wallet you want to use is up to you. That said, here are some basic solutions:

If you don’t care about transacting with either BTC or BTU anytime soon, and really just want to keep both as a long-term investment, printing your private keys on a paper wallet is one option. This option, however, is only really secure if you follow strict security precautions, which you can find here.

Another option is to get a hardware wallet. Any of the hardware wallets listed on bitcoin.org will keep your private keys secure. One hardware wallet provider in particular, Trezor, has explicitly acknowledged that users will have access to their coins on both ends of the chain if a coin-split happens.

Regular wallets are about as secure as your computer (or phone) is. Since most computers and phones are not all that secure, these are not ideal for large amounts. With that in mind, all mobile wallets and desktop wallets listed on bitcoin.org will store your private keys for you. Additionally, a full node like Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots gives you a little extra security during a coin-split, as you’ll see below.

In any case: Make sure you make backups of your keys! Most wallets require you to do this when installing; don’t skip this step.

During the Coin-Split
The first thing to note is that Bitcoin Unlimited has not set a ""flag date"" to fork. This means that theoretically, a fork could happen at any time. Realistically, however, it will depend on miner coordination, and it will probably be obvious to even casual Bitcoin observers when a fork is close to happening.

If Bitcoin Unlimited does fork, things could get messy for anywhere between a couple of hours to a couple of days, or longer.

Unfortunately, Bitcoin Unlimited currently does not include “replay protection.” This means that post-fork, transactions on both sides of the fork will look identical. If a transaction is picked up by both networks — for example, because the receiver of a transaction re-transmits the transaction on the other network — that transaction may be valid on both chains. This is called a “replay attack.”

As such, spending coins on one end of the chain could make you accidentally spend the equivalent coin on the other side of the chain. Instead of paying someone only BTC, you may unintentionally send BTU as well — or vice versa. This is how the BTCs and BTUs are “stuck together.”

The best way to prevent replay attacks is simple: do not send any transactions. Not until it is clearer to everyone what the post-fork situation looks like.

If you use Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots as a wallet and you want to accept BTC, that should still be fine. (Someone who didn’t read this article may accidentally send you the equivalent in BTU, though. If this happens, you should probably return the funds later on.)

Bitcoin Unlimited, on the other hand, does not include “wipeout protection.” If the amount of mining power on the BTC chain ever overtakes the BTU chain, the entire BTU chain will be discarded (unless users on the BTU chain coordinate fast enough to prevent this in unconventional ways).

Unless and until it is absolutely clear that Bitcoin Unlimited emerges as a definitive winner forever, accepting any BTU is very risky, and you probably shouldn’t do it at all.

After the Coin-Split
If both chains survive, and you control your private keys, you will have coins on both sides of the fork. But as mentioned, it will be tricky to spend coins on one chain without accidentally spending the equivalent on the other side.

Fortunately, there are ways to avoid these replay attacks. The most straightforward solution requires brand-new coins, mined after the split. These new coins are the only coins that do not exist on both chains and cannot, therefore, be spent on both. Combining these new coins with old coins effectively splits the BTC from BTU.

This coin-splitting can, and probably will, be a bit complex. But some exchanges will likely set up coin-splitting services and take care of most of the complexity behind the screens. You’d just need to send your bitcoins to an exchange, and the exchange will credit your account with BTC and BTU. (They should even replay the transaction for you, to make sure they indeed receive both your coins and can split them for you.) If you want, you can now also sell your BTU for BTC (or fiat currency), or the other way round.

There may also be other solutions to split your coins in the event of a coin-split, perhaps even trustless solutions. But that remains to be seen.

After the split, there will probably be wallets for both coins soon enough. Of course, you may need to upgrade your existing wallet or download a new wallet if and when this happens. This also remains to be seen. (Do not accept any transactions on your wallet before this is clear.)

Further specifics on what to do after a coin-split will be announced on Bitcoin Magazine (and most likely on bitcoin.org and other sources of information) if and when a coin-split occurs and we have a better understanding of the post-fork situation.

Oh, and when you, years from now, want to use the funds stored on your paper wallet, don’t forget you now own both BTC and BTU! (Wallets like Electrum and Blockchain allow you to upload the private keys, and you’ll probably need to go through the same splitting ceremony.)

If only one chain survives, operations should continue at some point. However, it’s not exactly clear what this post-fork landscape will look like. Perhaps you’ll have to upgrade your wallet. This will also be announced on Bitcoin Magazine if and when it comes to it.

If neither chain survives, the Bitcoin experiment has failed, and your private keys will probably be worthless.",Technical,0.296
2017/3/27,How Light Clients Can Protect Themselves From a Bitcoin Coin-Split,"Bitcoin could soon split in two. If Bitcoin Unlimited miners start mining blocks exceeding one megabyte, these would be rejected by full Bitcoin nodes like Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Knots. This could result in two different and incompatible blockchains and networks, each with their own currency: Bitcoin’s “BTC” and Bitcoin Unlimited’s “BTU.”

While full nodes would know which protocol to follow, for many light clients — like almost all mobile wallets — things would not be so clear. One type of light client in particular, Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) wallets, often rely on data received from random nodes. These could be Bitcoin nodes or Bitcoin Unlimited nodes. Therefore, users will have no way of knowing whether they’re seeing BTC or BTU in their wallet interface. They could inadvertently accept one currency, while thinking they’re accepting the other.

But a recent Bitcoin Improvement Proposal by Bitcoin Knots maintainer and Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr can solve this.

Simplified Payment Verification

Simplified Payment Verification was first described by Satoshi Nakamoto in the Bitcoin white paper. SPV wallets do connect to Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer network directly, but request only a bare minimum of data. They currently check blocks for proof of work to make sure these aren’t created out of thin air. And to calculate their balance, they check if any bitcoins were sent to or from their specific Bitcoin addresses.

The problem with SPV wallets is that they can be fooled by miners. For example, a miner could create a block that has a valid proof of work but which spends bitcoins that don’t belong to the miner. The SPV wallet has no idea that these bitcoins don’t belong to the miner, so it would accept the transaction as a valid payment.

Likewise, an SPV wallet doesn’t check for Bitcoin’s block size limit. So, if a split happens, these wallets will check for proof of work but won’t know that a block is invalid according to the (current) Bitcoin protocol. If Bitcoin Unlimited has the longest chain by proof of work, and an SPV wallet receives data from at least one Bitcoin Unlimited node, it blindly follows the Bitcoin Unlimited chain instead.

As an unfortunate consequence, this means that users of SPV wallets could unknowingly accept BTU, when they think they’re accepting BTC. Their wallet can’t tell the difference, and if they are not paying attention to Bitcoin’s scaling debate, they may not even know there was a split. It’s only when they spend their coins, deposit them in a different wallet or send them to an exchange that they’ll find out they don’t own any BTC; they own BTU. Or more accurately: they owned BTU, and now they have to hope that the merchant, the other wallet or the exchange accepts BTU or returns it to them.

And that’s not taking into account that the Bitcoin Unlimited chain may at some point be discarded altogether. If that were to happen, their coins would suddenly disappear from their wallet.

Fraud Proofs

In the Bitcoin white paper, Satoshi Nakamoto proposed a solution for these attack vectors. If a full node detects an invalid block, Nakamoto suggested, it should send an “alert” to SPV nodes. This solution has not been developed, however, and it is unclear whether it really can be.

This explains why some Bitcoin developers have always been wary of the current implementation of SPV wallets. And perhaps none more than Luke Dashjr. (Dashjr even refers to these wallets as “pseudo-SPV” or “pSPV”; he believes their lack of security doesn’t warrant the term “SPV” as described in the Bitcoin white paper.)

Now, Dashjr is proposing a partial fix to the problem, specifically designed for the block size limit. Digging into the weeds of Bitcoin’s hashing algorithm, the Bitcoin developer thinks he has figured out a way to determine whether a block exceeds one megabyte with only the proof of work hash, and a sort of alert first suggested by Nakamoto (now called a “fraud proof”). While an SPV wallet won’t know the exact size, it will know when a block exceeds one megabyte.

These fraud proofs will need to be sent from full nodes, like Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots. Once at least about a quarter of all Bitcoin nodes on the network have upgraded to provide fraud proofs, SPV nodes that have integrated the solution should connect to at least one of them and be relatively reliable.",Technical,-0.9833
2017/4/12,"Christian Decker on Bitcoin Network Improvements, Tradeoffs and Finding the Block Size “Sweet Spot”","At the core of Bitcoin’s scaling debate has been the block size limit. For better or worse, the majority of the discussions about scaling in the Bitcoin community have mostly been focused on this one variable.

As an oversimplification of the current debate: Some would like to see an increase in block size which would enable more on-chain transactions per second; others would like to see the block size limit remain low in an effort to limit the cost of operating a full node while moving some types of payments above the base Bitcoin protocol to secondary layers such as the Lightning Network and sidechains.

In early 2016, a research paper was released in which the relationship between increased on-chain capacity and increased costs of operating a full node were explored. The paper, titled On Scaling Decentralized Blockchains, explained that blocks must not exceed 4 megabytes if the goal is to prevent more than 10 percent of the full nodes on the network from being overwhelmed by the demands of the network. This 4 megabyte metric is often brought up during discussions around the proper block size limit for Bitcoin.

According to Christian Decker, an infrastructure tech engineer at Blockstream and one of the co-authors of the paper, Bitcoin network communication has improved over the past few months which, the paper explained, has affected the tradeoffs.

Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Decker to gather more information related to what the Bitcoin network can handle today in terms of block sizes.

Clearing Up Misconceptions Around the Study

Decker first wanted to clarify a common misconception of the research presented in the paper on scaling decentralized blockchains:

“Our results are not binary, in that they are not showing a threshold up to which nothing happens and going just beyond [which] bad things start to happen,” Decker explained. “What we do is show that there is a tradeoff between block size and the guarantees that confirmations give us.”

According to another paper co-authored by Decker, titled Information Propagation on the Bitcoin Network, an increasing block size will also increase the blockchain fork rate, which means confirmations in the current version of the blockchain become less reliable for users.

“What we can compute are upper bounds on block size, after which the system will definitely become unstable, e.g., never converge to a unique ledger state,” Decker continued. “However the tradeoff between block size, confirmation guarantees, and centralization pressure is continuous: Even small changes have an effect. We show that the tradeoff exists and that it must be taken into consideration, but the decision about what the sweet spot in this tradeoff is, is a political issue and less a technical one. If network participants are happy to have a less decentralized network in exchange for an incremental transaction rate increase, that's their decision.”

While Decker said he is convinced that a moderate block size increase is possible without incurring too many negative effects, he also noted that the precedent set by such a move needs to be taken into consideration.

“There are natural limits to the size that the network can support, namely our worst case thresholds, beyond which we cannot go,” Decker stated. “An increase today could signal that in case of block space contention we can always just increase the block size, which is definitely not true.”

Improvements to the Bitcoin Network

According to Decker, the fundamental analysis provided by On Scaling Decentralized Blockchains is still relevant, but there have been incremental improvements achieved over the past few months that have had a noticeable effect on the tradeoffs described in the paper. Decker pointed to Bitcoin Core contributor Matt Corallo’s work on the FIBRE relay network and Compact Block Relay as specific contributors to network communication improvements.

Decker also runs BitcoinStats.com which tracks the efficiency of information propagation around the Bitcoin network. He recently updated the site with new data that, in his view, shows the propagation of blocks around the network is much faster than it was before Corallo’s improvements were implemented.


Screenshot 2017-04-10 at 2.26.10 PM.png

According to Decker, a comparison of block propagation times between now and one year ago show that a 3 megabyte block today has an equivalent propagation time of a 1 megabyte block from one year ago. It took a 1 megabyte block 6.5 seconds to reach half of the network a year ago, while it takes roughly 2 seconds today. However, Decker added that size increases have increased longtail propagation time, which means it now takes longer for a block to reach every single node on the network.

“Both [FIBRE] and [Compact Block Relay] employ forward error correction to reduce the amount of data to be shipped around the world and recombine blocks from multiple sources instead of relying on a single source,” Decker explained. “This creates geographically distributed seeds from which the blocks are then forwarded to the remaining peers.”

In the past, Corallo and BTC.com’s Kevin Pan have told Bitcoin Magazine that FIBRE and Compact Block Relay have also led to a decline in the number of empty blocks mined on the network.

What Can Bitcoin Handle Today?

At this time, further analysis on what impact the implemented network improvements have had on Bitcoin’s ability to handle blocks larger than 4 megabytes has not been made available. “I am continually monitoring the network propagation, and need to aggregate them and re-evaluate our analysis,” Decker said.

“What is safe strongly depends on the requirements of the user, the tradeoff is still valid, it just shifted slightly due to the increased efficiency,” Decker added.

According to Decker, extrapolating a new throughput limit based on the improvements in how efficiently data is shipped around the world may be simplistic. In other words, a threefold improvement in network communication does not necessarily mean the 4 megabytes number in the original paper would be 12 megabytes if it were written today.

“These one-time efficiency increases have certainly moved the throughput limit at which bad things definitely happen upwards, but whether it is at 12 megabytes, I'm not sure,” explained Decker. “As I mentioned, it's not a binary threshold, just an upper limit, and putting a number on it just does not mean that lower values are safe.”

In conclusion, Decker added that there are some types of transactions that will never make sense as on-chain transactions due to the intrinsic costs involved. “There will always be use-cases which are not fit for on-chain payments.” he stated. “There is also a privacy increase in using off-chain transfers, since they no longer leave a permanent trace in the blockchain.”

In Decker’s view, off-chain protocols, such as the Lightning Network or Duplex Micropayment Channels, are desirable for long-term scalability because they evolve much faster and do not rely on consensus from the entire ecosystem to enable.

“I think Segregated Witness is both a malleability fix, enabling these higher level protocols, and a safe block size increase, which does not set the dangerous precedent of just bumping the block size [limit] when there is block size contention,” Decker stated.",Technical,-0.1531
2017/4/20,How Bitcoin Extension Blocks Are Backward Compatible — and How They’re Not,"Through a splash in the media, Purse and its in-house-built alternative Bitcoin implementation Bcoin recently presented their scaling proposal, dubbed “To the Moon.” Where Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited all attempt to increase Bitcoin’s block size limit with a hard fork, and Bitcoin Core developers prefer a Segregated Witness soft fork (SegWit), Purse CEO Andrew Lee announced a third approach: extension blocks.

Extension blocks were actually first proposed by Bitcoin Core developer Johnson Lau in 2013 (as “auxiliary blocks”), and again earlier this year. The solution generally shares many of the virtues of hard forks: extension blocks allow for almost any protocol change. But they share one significant benefit with soft forks: extension blocks are backward compatible.

Well, sort of …

Soft Forks

Soft forks are protocol changes that add new rules or tighten up existing ones. “Old nodes” — as we’ll call them for now — will consider a soft-forked chain valid because it doesn’t break any “old rules.” This makes soft forks backward compatible: they allow old nodes to coexist on the same network with “new nodes” that enforce the soft fork.

While soft forks can only add or tighten rules, they can be cleverly used to extend Bitcoin’s capabilities. To do this, soft forks typically utilize special Bitcoin addresses known as “anyonecanspend.” (They’re actually “outputs,” not addresses, but for simplicity’s sake ignore that for now.)

If these anyonecanspend addresses hold any bitcoins, it means that anyone can spend them; no cryptographic signature or anything else is required … or so it seems to old nodes.

But that’s not what new nodes, enforcing the new rules, see. The new rules prescribe that the bitcoins in these anyonecanspend addresses can only be spent under specific conditions, defined by the soft fork. These new rules can, for example, prescribe that a certain amount of time must have passed (CLTV) or that a signature must be included in a new part of a Bitcoin block (SegWit).

Extension Blocks

Extension blocks resemble soft forks, but quite literally take the concept to another level.

An extension block itself looks a lot like a normal Bitcoin block, which we’ll call a “base block.” Like a base block, an extension block mostly includes a bunch of transactions.

But there is a difference. A base block is cryptographically linked to the previous base block and to the next base block, chaining all base blocks chronologically to form Bitcoin’s blockchain. An extension block, on the other hand, links only to one corresponding base block. Extension blocks “peg along” base blocks.

Similar to most soft forks, extension blocks utilize anyonecanspend addresses. But now, these anyonecanspend addresses act like enter and exit points, to and from the extension blocks.

When a transaction is sent from a base block to an extension block, an old node is tricked. From the perspective of the old node, the coins are sent to a typical anyonecanspend address on the base block. The coins never leave the base block as far as the old node is concerned, and in fact the old node doesn’t even see the extension block.

But from the perspective of a new node, the bitcoins are really sent to a whole new address on the extension block — an “extension address.” This extension address behaves more or less like a normal Bitcoin address.

Interestingly, these bitcoins can then even start to circulate from extension address to extension address, from one extension block to the next. As such, new nodes see the coins moving around and changing ownership. At the same time, old nodes do not see anything and think the bitcoins are still stuck in the original anyonecanspend address.

A new node can also send the bitcoins from their extension address back to a normal address on the base block. This is done by tricking old nodes again: from the perspective of the old node, the coins are finally moved from the anyonecanspend address. Only a new node knows where the coins really came from.

Once the bitcoins are back in the base block and a normal address, old and new nodes see the same thing.

As perhaps the main benefit of extension blocks, they don’t need to adhere to the original Bitcoin protocol in almost any way. This opens up a whole category of new possibilities. The extension blocks can perhaps offer more programmability like Ethereum or Ethereum Classic, or more privacy like Monero, Zcash or Mimblewimble.

Bcoin’s proposal is modest, however: “To the Moon” extension blocks are mostly just bigger than normal blocks (by a so-far unknown amount), so they can handle more transactions. They also include Segregated Witness, and some added benefits specifically crafted to support the lightning network on top of the extension blocks.

Complexity

While extension blocks in general, and To the Moon in particular, can work technically, they do present some drawbacks.

At the heart of these drawbacks, To the Moon is more technically complex than other scaling solutions proposed so far, including all hard forks as well as a Segregated Witness soft fork. This also makes them more complicated to implement.

And from a user perspective, To the Moon would leave old nodes in the dark more than most soft forks do. While old nodes don’t know how coins on soft-forked anyonecanspend addresses can be spent, with extension blocks, old nodes don’t even know where coins are. This means that old nodes can’t trace the history of a coin and perhaps in some cases temporarily can’t even spend it. (This could be the case if a blockchain reorganization takes place; this can cosmetically change what a transaction from an extension block to an old node looks like.)

As such, not everyone loves To the Moon. Johnson Lau, the original proposer of extension blocks, argues that To the Moon “failed to meet the very important requirement of a softfork: backward compatibility.” He instead still considers extension blocks “more as an academic topic than something really ready for production use.” Similarly, Bitcoin Core developer and Bitcoin Knots maintainer Luke Dashjr warns that extension blocks “are a risk of creating two classes of ‘full nodes,’"" where non-upgraded nodes are ""left insecure like pseudo-SPV (not even real SPV) nodes.” And Bitcoin Core developer Matt Corallo dismisses the idea that extension blocks should be considered opt-in at all — instead “the entire network is forced to trust the extension block,” a “pretty terrible precedent.”",Technical,-0.9959
2017/4/23,Bitcoin Core 0.14.1: SegWit Signalling and Memory Accounting,"The Bitcoin Core project, launched by Satoshi Nakamoto eight years ago and today led by Wladimir van der Laan, aims to release a new major release of the software about once every six months. Such a release (0.12.0, 0.13.0, 0.14.0…) includes most of the improvements made since the last major release.

In between major releases, the Bitcoin Core project often offers minor releases (0.12.1, 0.13.1, 0.13.2…). These either include soft fork upgrades, which are included in minor releases to make opting out as easy as possible. Or they include bug fixes and other modest improvements.

This weekend marks the official release of a new minor release: Bitcoin Core 0.14.1.

Here’s what the newest iteration of the first most-used Bitcoin implementation has to offer.

SegWit Signaling

Perhaps the most noteworthy change in the new release affects miners, and in particular concerns Segregated Witness (SegWit), the protocol upgrade at the heart of Bitcoin Core’s scaling roadmap.

Segregated Witness is a soft fork, which means that non-upgraded nodes will remain part of the same network as upgraded nodes. This is technically also true for miners; they can continue to mine blocks without including any SegWit transactions if they so choose. (Though, if they do not upgrade at all, they may want to take some precautions to avoid mining on top of invalid blocks.)

Bitcoin Core 0.14.1 now also offers miners the option to exclude any Segregated Witness transactions even if the soft fork activates. They can continue to mine blocks that only include “old style” transactions if they prefer.

Additionally, Bitcoin Core 0.14.1 miners that prefer to exclude SegWit transactions will, by default, still signal support for the upgrade regardless. After all, SegWit activation shouldn’t really be a problem for them: With Bitcoin Core 0.14.1, they are technically ready to avoid invalid blocks, and they can themselves create blocks without SegWit transactions all the same.

Memory Accounting

For normal, non-mining users, the biggest change in Bitcoin Core 0.14.1 is probably an improvement in memory use.

Bitcoin nodes keep a buffer of recent changes to the state of the blockchain (the “UTXO-set”) in memory. Recent changes are most likely to change again, and keeping this in memory lets nodes access it as fast as possible. This way, nodes can accept and validate transactions and blocks rapidly, and forward them accordingly, thereby benefiting the whole network. Once in a while, the current state of the UTXO-set is “flushed”: This is when the data is stored on disc more permanently.

Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 showed some problems estimating how much headroom is needed in memory to perform this flush. This could have detrimental effects on low-end systems in particular, like some Raspberry Pi’s, and other computers with limited memory. In Bitcoin Core 0.14.1, memory usage for the UTXO-set is calculated more accurately, which should help well-configured machines run more smoothly.

Additionally, Bitcoin Core 0.14.1 includes a number of smaller bug fixes and optimisations.

The next major release, Bitcoin Core 0.15.0, is expected around autumn of this year.

2017/5/10,Litecoin Has Now Deployed Segregated Witness,"It’s official. Litecoin, one of the oldest and biggest altcoins by market cap, deployed Segregated Witness (SegWit) today. The protocol upgrade that was originally developed for Bitcoin and proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team locked in on Litecoin two weeks ago, and was enforced by a majority of hash power on the Litecoin network as of a couple of hours ago.

The Segregated Witness soft fork activated without major issues — though there was an early slip up by the biggest Litecoin mining pool on the network.

“F2Pool had a hiccup where they were not mining Litecoin correctly. For some reason their LTC pool was returning a BTC template to miners. We reached out to them and they fixed it right away,” Litecoin inventor Charlie Lee told Bitcoin Magazine.

SegWit

Launched in 2011, Litecoin was one of the first altcoins to gain significant traction. As opposed to some newer altcoins like Ethereum, Ripple and Monero, Litecoin is a straight fork of Bitcoin’s codebase but with a different mining algorithm and some changed parameters, such as faster confirmation times. This similarity to Bitcoin does mean that Litecoin suffers from similar weaknesses as Bitcoin, like transaction malleability.

And, indeed, that it can adopt similar solutions and improvements, like Segregated Witness.

While Litecoin inventor Charlie Lee has been advocating for activation of the soft fork since late 2016, miner support initially did not follow. This changed following the Global LTC Roundtable Meeting, an online meeting held amongst prominent stakeholders in the Litecoin industry, who are based particularly in China. The participants agreed on “Litecoin Global Roundtable Resolution 001 (2017),” which, among other things, holds that the mining pools would activate SegWit.

With its SegWit activation, the “silver to Bitcoin’s gold” has immediately reclaimed a place in the spotlight, and the markets have been taking notice. Having lingered in Bitcoin’s shadow for years at price levels below $5, Litecoin’s exchange rate surged almost tenfold in anticipation of SegWit. The altcoin reached almost $40 today and is trading around $33 at time of publication.

Bitcoin

Perhaps even more important, some prominent Bitcoin projects — like .NET Bitcoin library NBitcoin and wallet mSIGNA — announced to port their work to Litecoin now that it has enabled SegWit. Even more notable, Lightning Labs will roll out a version of their lightning network implementation on Litecoin, while ACINQ has tested their lightning software on the altcoin, too. Similarly, Bitcoin Core developer Johnson Lau, one of the authors of SegWit, has indicated that he will realize smart-contracting solution MAST on Litecoin.

Further down the road, Segregated Witness enables more innovations that could be deployed on Litecoin first. Confidential Transactions, Schnorr signatures and TumbleBit are all in the works for Bitcoin, and shouldn’t take too much effort to port to Litecoin.

Lee himself, furthermore, hopes that atomic swaps will soon see the light of day, enabling an instant and trustless altcoin exchange and lightning network type of transactions across different digital currencies.

“SegWit opens up the doors to many amazing features that can be added to Litecoin,” Lee said. “These include Lightning Network, MAST, Confidential Transactions, Schnorr Signatures and more. I think Litecoin can show Bitcoin that SegWit is indeed the best way to improve the protocol. So I think it will help get that happening sooner on Bitcoin.”

Segregated Witness is still pending activation on Bitcoin, where it requires 95 percent hash power support. It has stagnated at around 30 percent so far.",Technical,0.9945
2017/5/23,These Two UASFs Could Activate SegWit,"Segregated Witness (SegWit), the Bitcoin protocol upgrade proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team, was originally designed to activate via the Bitcoin Improvement Protocol 9 (BIP 9) standard, a hash-power signalling mechanism. This would allow the Bitcoin ecosystem to coordinate the upgrade relatively safely through miner readiness.

But with the SegWit proposal in particular, BIP 9 no longer serves just to signal readiness. Miners as well as users increasingly see BIP 9 as a sort of miner vote on the desirability of the protocol upgrade. And some miners even seem to utilize it as a negotiation chip for protocol development.

The pseudonymous developer who goes by the name “Shaolinfry” considers this an abuse of the coordination mechanism. He therefore recently proposed an alternative activation scheme: a user-activated soft fork, better known as a “UASF.”

Shaolinfry also drafted two specific UASF proposals: BIP 148 and BIP 149. Both of these are currently “in the running” for user adoption. And speaking with Bitcoin Magazine, Shaolinfry, at least, seems sure that one of them will be accepted by the network.

“There is no universe in which SegWit will not get activated.”

SegWit and the UASF
A soft fork is a change to the Bitcoin protocol that introduces new rules or tightens existing ones. This makes soft forks backward compatible: nodes that did not upgrade should remain part of the same Bitcoin network.

Segregated Witness is a soft fork that would increase Bitcoin’s block size limit and solve some longstanding protocol issues. While it’s always hard to say with conclusive certainty, the proposal seems to have broad support within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Many wallets, exchanges and other companies in the space have indicated they are ready for it, while an overwhelming share of reachable nodes on the network have implemented the solution, too.

As per BIP 9, the current implementation of SegWit activates if about 95 percent of hash power signals support within a two-week difficulty period before November. However, hash power support has so far stagnated at around 30 percent.

This apparent mismatch between the ecosystem and hash power support is why some — like BIP 9 co-author Rusty Russell — are increasingly thinking the activation method was a mistake.

And Shaolinfry does, too.

“The main issue with BIP 9 is that it has a veto of only about 5 percent of hash power,” Shaolinfry explained. “That veto could be intentionally or unintentionally triggered. Intentionally, like how miners are currently blocking SegWit activation. Or unintentionally due to upgrade apathy.

“Miner activation also draws attention to mining pool operators politically. The whole world is paying attention to who is and isn’t signaling. That is undesirable. And what if the soft fork is for something that could make governments angry? We know this is the case in China for anonymity features, and increasingly in the United States as well.”

As such, Shaolinfry proposed activating SegWit through a UASF.

The idea behind any UASF, in short, is that users simply activate the soft fork at an agreed-upon point in time. If these users represent a majority of the Bitcoin economy — exchanges, merchants, users — miners are financially incentivized to follow the new soft fork rules. If they don’t, they could mine invalid blocks (according to the majority of the Bitcoin economy), and the “bitcoins” they earn would be worth less — or worth nothing at all.

Once a majority of hash power does follow these financial incentives and enforces the new rules, the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem should automatically follow, just like with any other soft fork.

BIP 148
The first UASF proposal drafted by Shaolinfry is BIP 148.

BIP 148 is an interesting take on a UASF because it is actually designed to trigger the existing BIP 9 SegWit-activation threshold.

“If you want to redeploy SegWit, you must wait for the current deployment to expire by November of this year because many Bitcoin nodes won’t accept it otherwise,” Shaolinfry explained. “BIP 148 is a way to make the current BIP 141 deployment activate before November. That’s faster, and has the advantage that more than 70 percent of nodes has already upgraded.”

Specifically, starting on August 1, BIP 148 nodes will reject any Bitcoin blocks that do not signal support for Segregated Witness via BIP 9. So, if the majority of the Bitcoin economy enforces BIP 148, miners will have to signal support for SegWit in order not to have their blocks rejected.

Once these miners do signal support for SegWit, this signaling would also trigger all the “normal” SegWit nodes on the network. All these nodes would then enforce SegWit, even if they didn’t participate in the BIP 148 activation themselves.

And, from a game theory perspective, it may even be viable for a relatively small minority of the Bitcoin economy to get BIP 148 activated. Miners should have little to lose by signaling support for SegWit, but something to lose from not signaling: a smaller total number of users to sell their bitcoins to. As such, even a modest but committed BIP 148 user base could potentially be enough.

Finally, echoing his Medium post on Litecoin’s SegWit activation, Shaolinfry noted that even the possibility of such a UASF could be enough to make miners signal support — without even needing nodes to actually enforce it.

BIP 148: Risks and Incentives
There are, however, some risks. These are why some prominent Bitcoin Core developers — like Blockstream CTO Gregory Maxwell and Chaincode Labs Co-Founder Suhas Daftuar — consider BIP 148 too disruptive.

Per BIP 148, otherwise valid blocks would be rejected merely because they don’t include a signal. The rejection of these blocks would waste miners’ resources and detrimentally affect Bitcoin’s security.

Moreover, if only a minority of hash power enforces the new rules — either because they ignore financial incentives or because only a small minority of the economy enforces the new rules in the first place — the Bitcoin blockchain could split in two. There would be a “SegWit chain” and a “non-SegWit chain.” That would open up a new can of worms, where the risks for users on both ends of the chain are not the same.

“The incentives are clearly there for miners to follow the economy,” said Shaolinfry in response to this criticism. “But indeed, there is a chain split risk if less than 51 percent [of] miners comply and run BIP 148. However, even in this circumstance, the non-BIP 148 chain is asymmetrically disadvantaged, and will almost certainly be completely wiped out. The SegWit chain will always be more valuable, and once a majority of miners switches to that chain, the non-SegWit chain will disappear altogether.”

Furthermore, from a certain threshold on, the risk of a chain split become smaller as it gathers more support. This is why another prominent Bitcoin Core developer, Luke Dashjr, is throwing his weight behind the proposal.

And to avoid these kinds of risks, there could be another twist to BIP 148 as well, Shaolinfry pointed out:

“The interesting thing about BIP 148 is that any majority of miners can trigger it — it doesn’t have to be 95 percent. If 75 or even just 51 percent of hash power starts rejecting non-signaling blocks per August 1, they will always claim the longest chain. So really, all miners will from then on have to signal support and activate SegWit — or have all their blocks orphaned by the network.”

Finally, Shaolinfry may also release code — “Segsignal” — to allow miners to signal whether they will deploy BIP 148 and under what condition. Using this, miners could, for example, agree to activate SegWit through BIP 148 if, and only if, 51 percent indicates that they are willing to.

“This should remove any risk of a chain-split, even a short-lived one,” Shaolinfry said.

BIP 149 (and BIP 8)
Shaolinfry’s alternative UASF proposal is BIP 149.

BIP 149 utilizes an entirely new soft fork activation mechanism: BIP 8. BIP 8 resembles BIP 9 in that it initially allows miners to activate the soft fork through hash power. However, as opposed to BIP 9, the soft fork proposal doesn’t just time out by the end of the activation period. Instead, it sets an activation deadline. If that deadline is reached, nodes activate the soft fork regardless of hash power support.

There is a particular technical advantage of BIP 149 over BIP 148: it is less intrusive for miners. While BIP 148 effectively forces miners to signal, with BIP 149 miners don’t actually have to do all that much. They can support SegWit if they want to. If not, they may want to run a so-called “border node” to filter invalid transactions and blocks post-activation, but that’s about it.

Shaolinfry plans to implement BIP 149 in dedicated Bitcoin software if BIP 148 doesn’t succeed, and when the current BIP 9 SegWit proposal has expired by mid-November. The activation deadline for BIP 149 is then scheduled for early July 2018.  

Some developers, like Maxwell, are in no rush to activate SegWit and consider BIP 149 preferable. But others, like Dashjr, believe it will take too long.

Shaolinfry himself noted:

“BIP 149 is not too slow from a technical point of view. But, I do think the longer SegWit isn’t activated, the more gremlins and obstacles are going to besiege Bitcoin. So if the ecosystem rallies around BIP 148, that would bring this nightmare to a close.”",Technical,0.9721
2017/5/24,DCG’s Bitcoin Scaling Proposal and What it Needs to Succeed,"Spearheaded by Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group (DCG),  this week over 50 companies signed and published a “Bitcoin Scaling Agreement” on Medium. The agreement intends to put an end to Bitcoin’s long-lasting scaling debate. 

Whether it actually will is a another question.

Here’s what the agreement entails, how it compares to existing scaling proposals and what it requires to succeed …

What the Agreement Entails
The DCG agreement is based on the “SegWit2MB” proposal, originally floated by RSK Founder and Chief Scientist Sergio Demian Lerner. This proposal couples activation of Segregated Witness (SegWit), the centrepiece of Bitcoin Core’s scaling roadmap, with an added block-size-increase hard fork down the road. While SegWit itself offers an increase to two to four megabytes, the added hard fork should double this to a maximum of eight megabytes.

According to the Medium post, the soft fork will be activated “at an 80% threshold,” (presumably) referring to hash power. And the hard fork will be activated “within six months.”

However, it seems that different signatories have different interpretations of what this actually means. Some claim that SegWit will be activated as a soft fork first, followed by a separate block-size-increase hard fork later. Others suggest that the soft fork will come first, but in such a way that it would trigger hard fork code, which still activates later. Yet others suggest that both the soft fork and the hard fork will be activated at the same time. And some even think the hard fork will come first, followed by SegWit activation later.

While these kinds of details may still need to be worked out, over 50 companies signed the agreement. Combined, they currently represent more than 80 percent of hash power on the network and, according to these companies, $5.1 billion USD in transaction volume as well as 20.5 million Bitcoin wallets.

But there are telling omissions, too. Perhaps most notably, no Bitcoin Core developer is party to the agreement, nor were any of them even present at the meeting. Similarly, none of the entities that fund Bitcoin Core developers — like Chaincode Labs, Blockstream or MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative — signed on. And of course, some 50 companies are only a segment of the Bitcoin industry in the first place; several big players are still missing.

Last but not least, Bitcoin’s broader user base is not involved with the agreement either, nor is the agreement in any way tied to community support.

How the Agreement Compares to Existing Scaling Solutions
Like the DCG agreement, Bitcoin Core’s scaling roadmap includes Segregated Witness as well. It also suggests that a hard fork to further increase the block size limit could be needed in the future, though it does not specify a specific point in time. Most Bitcoin Core developers also believe that a hard fork requires at least a year to prepare, perhaps more. As such, both Bitcoin Core and the DCG agreement share activation of SegWit as a first step in their scaling plans — but not the hard fork part.

However, the SegWit activation mechanism that is part of the DCG agreement slightly differs from the current activation mechanism implemented in Bitcoin Core. Most important, the DCG agreement lowers the required hash power threshold from 95 to 80 percent. And because of how SegWit is designed, activation through the DCG agreement is incompatible with all SegWit-ready Bitcoin nodes on the network.

It may be possible to work around this issue, however. As proposed by Bitmain Warranty engineer James Hilliard, SegWit activation can be made compatible between the DCG agreement and Bitcoin Core, though it’s a bit “hacky.” In short, if miners signal support for SegWit along the DCG agreement with at least 80 percent of hash power, this 80 percent can also start to completely reject any block that does not signal support for SegWit. This activates the current SegWit proposal by Bitcoin Core, as that would reach its 95 percent threshold as well.

Down the road, the DCG agreement’s hard fork is very unlikely to be implemented in Bitcoin Core for a number of reasons, but most importantly because it is contentious.

Other scaling proposals, like Bitcoin Unlimited’s Emergent Consensus or Bcoin’s Extension Blocks, are not necessarily incompatible with the DCG agreement, or at least they don’t need to be.

What the Agreement Requires to Succeed
What the agreement requires to succeed depends on your concept of “success.” But it will be a challenge by any definition.

First off, it should be noted that the proposal — which allows for blocks of up to 8 megabytes — may not be safe. While the full extent of the block size issue is outside the scope of this article, suffice it to say that some think that 8 megabyte blocks are, in fact, a significant risk.

Perhaps even more important, code needs to be written, and it is not yet clear who will actually do this. Moreover, this code should really be reviewed and tested extensively: the plan is to have it carry billions of dollars’ worth of value. This will not be easy to do within six months; perhaps impossible.

Then, this code must be brought into production. For the hard fork in particular, this means that everyone effectively needs to integrate and switch to the new protocol. If all signatories of the agreement accomplish this, it would probably be sufficient to at least get this new protocol running.

It seems obvious that the signatories of the DCG agreement hope that the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem will also switch to the new protocol once the fork takes place. In that case, the new protocol would (probably) be considered the new ""Bitcoin” by everyone.

But given the contention of the proposed hard fork, this currently seems very unlikely.

While it’s impossible to predict the future, it seems almost certain that at least some segment of Bitcoin developers, miners, companies and — most important — users will reject the fork. They will stay put on the existing protocol even if that means it takes much longer for blocks to confirm, or they will roll out a user activated soft fork, or perhaps they will even deploy a counter–hard fork. Under any of these scenarios, the Bitcoin blockchain would “split” into two chains, or more.

The real challenge, therefore, is to get people to use the new chain. And, if that is desired, to get them to consider it the “real” Bitcoin. This will probably be a much harder challenge than forking itself, even for all the companies involved in the DCG agreement.

And most important, for the agreement to succeed in any way at all (perhaps even under a different name than “Bitcoin”), it will require the signatories to follow through. The Bitcoin protocol is difficult to change, and promises or Medium posts alone don’t have any impact on it whatsoever, as several similar commitments have proven in the past.",Technical,0.4939
2017/5/25,Bcoin Protocol Gets Major Development Funding With New Agreement,"Purse has announced a new agreement with Bitmain Technologies, F2Pool, Bitcoin.com and Bixin that will allocate millions of dollars to its bcoin protocol development.

When working with Bitcoin, decentralization is king. Purse CEO Andrew Lee, through bcoin, extends that logic to the Bitcoin protocol itself.

“For Bitcoin to take off, we need multiple implementations with even market share,” Lee explains in a Medium post. “Decentralizing protocol development will lead to multiple clients, diverse communities, more developers, better security and more innovation.”

So what is bcoin? Put simply, Bitcoin was written in C++ coding language, which has a steep learning curve and remains a bit out of reach for many developers. Bcoin helps to solve that problem by re-implementing Bitcoin in Javascript, arguably a more widely used language. This opens the door for more innovation in Bitcoin because more developers will be able to create apps and protocol improvements in Javascript instead of the more complex C++. In October of 2016, Purse announced that it would be running its online market service on top of bcoin.

An important feature of this new agreement is that the participants will gain no equity in any of the projects that arise from the funding. “Bitmain, Bitcoin.com, Bixin and F2Pool donated funds for a non-equity stake to specifically help with supporting the development of multiple implementations. Similar companies also donated to Parity (who is working on a Rust implementation of Bitcoin). The more client diversity Bitcoin has, the better,” explained Steven McKie, head of Growth & Product Content at Purse, in correspondence with Bitcoin Magazine. “Bcoin remains an independent project.”

As for how the funding will be allocated, McKie explains, “The funding will help directly with onboarding and training new developers to commit to the bcoin full-node implementation, open-source project.”

The timing of this announcement is important as it comes almost immediately after the announcement of the 2MBHF + SegWitSF agreement. According to McKie, “Bcoin will work to implement support for the 2MBHF + SegWitSF proposal into the codebase as we stated in our support for the proposal.” This funding agreement will go a long way toward helping that initiative.

“Bcoin is built for modularity and for developers to quickly be able to start utilizing Bitcoin’s robust global network and start hacking together useful tools and applications. Our full node is built on a stack that is attractive to as many developers as possible (node.js). Bcoin has support for all of Bitcoin’s latest features; it’s secure and production-tested by companies like Purse, BitPay, Bixin, Ripio and Bitwala — with more to come.”",Technical,0.4939
2017/5/31,A Bitcoin Beginner’s Guide to Surviving the BIP 148 UASF (updated),"This is a re-write of A Bitcoin Beginner’s Guide to Surviving a Coin-Split, specifically addressing issues associated with the upcoming BIP 148 UASF. (Update: And the BCC launch.)

July 26th update: With BIP91 activated, it seems increasingly unlikely there will be a Bitcoin 148/Legacy Bitcoin split at all. And while August 1st will see the launch of a new coin, Bitcoin Cash (BCC), this coin should include strong replay protection. All you need to do to be able to access your BCC is control your bitcoin (BTC) private keys on this day. This article includes information on how to.

There is a chance Bitcoin will experience a chain-split on August 1st. A segment of all Bitcoin users plans to activate a user activated soft fork (UASF) as described in Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 148 (BIP 148). Specifically, their nodes will reject any Bitcoin blocks that do not signal support for Segregated Witness (SegWit), the centerpiece of Bitcoin Core’s scaling roadmap.

If a majority of miners (by hash power) does not signal support for SegWit through BIP148 on August 1st, but at least some do, Bitcoin’s blockchain will split in two. In that case, there would be two types of Bitcoin tokens, which we’ll refer to in this article as “148 BTC” for coins on the soft forked chain, and “Legacy BTC” for coins on the chain that did not activate the soft fork. 

Update: There are now some alternative scenarios to keep the chain as one, mainly through alternative activation methods. But for simplicity's sake, this article will assume that these methods fail. More information on these alternative scenarios can be found here.

Update: There is now also more than one way in which Bitcoin can ""split"". Or more precisely, August 1st will see the launch of a new coin, ""Bitcoin Cash (BCC)"" or ""Bitcoin ABC (ABC)"", that gives all current bitcoin (BTC) holders the equivalent of their holdings in these new coins. This was unknown at the time of publication of this article, and is therefore not covered extensively. Many of the same security precautions apply, however, so if you follow this guide, all your coins (including BCC/ABC coins) should be safe. For more information, see this article.

The ""good"" news is that each bitcoin would effectively be copied to both chains. If you hold bitcoin right now, you will hold both 148 BTC and Legacy BTC after the split.

The bad news is that this coin-split can be messy and risky. And if you’re not careful, you could lose funds.

This guide will provide you with the basics to keeping your funds safe during the UASF and will help to make sure you make it to the “other side” with all your coins intact.

Author’s note: If you want to play the 148 BTC/Legacy BTC markets as soon as possible and you are fine with taking risks, and/or you really know what you are doing, this article is probably not for you: It’s a beginner’s guide.

Before August 1
First off, be aware that a chain-split can create a high-risk situation. There is a chance that some sort of cyber-battle will break out between the two camps, perhaps even escalating to the point where bitcoin’s exchange rate(s) drops sharply, possibly to zero. Make absolutely sure you are not holding more value in bitcoin than what you are willing to lose.

If you do decide to hold onto your bitcoins, the single most important piece of advice is this: Ensure that you control your own private keys.

If you are storing your bitcoins on an exchange, in a custodial wallet like Coinbase, Circle or Xapo, or on any other service that holds your private keys for you, you may or may not eventually receive coins on both ends of the chain. In fact, if these kinds of services aren’t well-prepared, there could be scenarios where you don’t get any coins at all. So far, very few exchanges have given any kind of guarantee.

So if you’re using any of these kinds of services to store your bitcoins, you need to create your own wallet. Send your bitcoins to one or several Bitcoin addresses in this new wallet. This wallet now holds your private keys.

What kind of wallet you use is up to you. That said, here are some basic solutions:

The only wallets that are entirely trustless are full node wallets, like Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots. These verify all protocol rules, but they can be a bit resource intensive to use. If you don’t care about transacting with bitcoin (either 148 BTC or Legacy BTC) anytime soon and really just want to keep both as a long-term investment, printing your private keys on a paper wallet is another option. This option, however, is only really secure if you follow strict security precautions, which you can find here. Alternatively, you could get yourself a hardware wallet. Any of the hardware wallets listed on bitcoin.org will keep your private keys secure.

Most regular desktop or mobile wallets, as listed on bitcoin.org, are about as secure as your computer or phone is. Since most computers and phones are not all that secure, these are not ideal for large amounts. With that in mind, all mobile wallets and desktop wallets listed on bitcoin.org will store your private keys for you.

In any case: Be sure to make backups of your keys! Most wallets require you to do this when installing: don’t skip this step.

On, and Perhaps (shortly) After, August 1
If a majority of hash power signals support for Segregated Witness through BIP148 on or before August 1st (or BIP141 or BIP91 before August 1st), the protocol upgrade should activate smoothly. In that case, you’re fine, even if you didn’t prepare at all.

Update: Even in the case of a smooth upgrade, it looks like Bitcoin Cash will still emerge. All it requires is some hash power and/or value dedicated to this chain.

But it’s also possible that a majority of hash power will not go along with the BIP 148 UASF on August 1st, in which case the chain could split. If you hold your private keys, you will then have both 148 BTC and Legacy BTC.

Such a chain-split could resolve in several ways.

If at any point on or after August 1st, the 148 BTC chain becomes the chain with most accumulated proof of work, both BIP 148 nodes as well as Legacy nodes would switch to the 148 BTC chain. As such, the Legacy BTC chain should be discarded, resolving the situation. It would have been a temporary split, and you should be fine if you held onto your private keys. You can now continue to use bitcoin as usual.

Update: This is not true for BCC. BCC will continue to exist for as long as there is any hash power and/or value dedicated to this chain.

But unless and until this happens (or other types of precautions are taken), there is always at least a theoretical risk that the Legacy BTC chain can be overtaken and be discarded like this. That chance should decrease as time goes on, but will realistically exist for days, and maybe even longer — even if no blocks are found on the 148 BTC chain.

As such, buying or accepting Legacy BTC after the split — and especially shortly after the split — is very risky. These bitcoins can quite literally disappear if the 148 BTC chain overtakes the Legacy BTC chain. Therefore, it’s not recommended that you buy or accept any Legacy BTC — if you do, at least be aware of and comfortable with the risk that your money could cease to exist.

Update: Buying or accepting BTC is not a problem if the only ""split"" is with the BCC chain.

BIP 148 nodes will never acknowledge the Legacy chain, so these will not switch regardless of which chain has more hash power. However, it is very risky to buy, accept or hold 148 BTC, too. Most importantly, there is no guarantee that 148 BTC will continue to be used. While that is of course true for any cryptocurrency, due to slow mining difficulty adjustments, a potentially hostile environment, and the continued possibility for SegWit to activate on the Legacy chain after all, it’s probably more true for 148 BTC. Additionally, block confirmations may be very slow for quite a while, which could make using 148 BTC for transacting impractical.

If you want to accept 148 BTC regardless, you need to run a BIP 148 full node as a wallet. You can find more information about that here, and you can find software downloads here.

Update: If you want to accept BCC, you'll need a dedicated BCC wallet.

On top of the Legacy BTC chain being discarded or the 148 BTC chain withering away, there is another big risk: replay attacks.

In case of a chain-split, transactions on both sides of the fork will look identical. If a transaction is picked up by both 148 BTC and Legacy BTC nodes — for example, because the receiver of a transaction retransmits that transaction — the transaction may be valid on both chains. This is called a “replay attack.”

As such, spending coins on one end of the chain could make you accidentally spend the equivalent coin on the other side of the chain. Instead of paying someone only in 148 BTC, you may unintentionally send Legacy BTC as well, or vice versa. 148 BTC and Legacy BTC are initially “stuck together.”

The best way to prevent replay attacks is simple: Do not send any transactions. At least not until it is clearer to everyone what the post-fork situation looks like. It's also best not to send any transactions the last day or two before August 1st, just in case they don't confirm in time.

Update: The replay risk is more complex for BCC. If you want to be on the safe side, it's still best to not send any transactions, at least for as long as BCC has any meaningful value to you.

After the Chain-Split
In case of the BIP 148 UASF, it is a bit hard to say what “after the chain-split” actually means.

If the 148 BTC chain gets more accumulated proof of work, it should be the only chain to survive, and the split would be over. All 148 BTC would then simply be bitcoins (BTC) again.

But if that doesn’t happen fast, and even if the 148 BTC chain appears non-active, a chain-split could, at the very least, linger for a while. Miners could start mining on that chain at any time. As such, the 148 BTC chain can in theory always wipe out the Legacy BTC chain.

And there are also possible scenarios where the two chains — 148 BTC and Legacy BTC — coexist. What’s more, even a scenario where more than two chains emerge can’t be taken out of the equation. In these scenarios, you will have coins on both (or all) sides of the fork. 

But as mentioned, it will be tricky to spend coins on one chain without accidentally spending the equivalent on the other(s). And the bad news is that splitting these coins can be a bit complex. (It will typically require freshly mined or double-spent coins.)

The good news, however, is that some exchanges will likely set up coin-splitting services and take care of most of the complexity behind the screens. You’d just need to send your bitcoins to an exchange, and the exchange will credit your account with 148 BTC and Legacy BTC. (They should even replay the transaction for you to make sure they indeed receive both your coins.) At that point, if you want, you will be able to sell or trade your coins.

If the split persists, there should be wallets for both (or all) coins soon enough. Of course, you may need to upgrade your existing wallet or download a new wallet if and when this happens. This outcome also remains to be seen. Do not accept any transactions on your wallet before this is clear. Note that the situation could remain uncertain for weeks!

Further specifics on what to do after a coin-split will be announced on Bitcoin Magazine (and most likely on bitcoin.org and other sources of information) if and when a coin-split occurs and we have a better understanding of the post-fork situation.

Update: Most of this holds up for BCC, except that it's very clear what ""after the chain-split"" means: it's August 1st and onwards.",Technical,0.296
2017/6/6,OpenTimestamps Has Timestamped the Entire Internet Archive — Here’s How,"OpenTimestamps, a project led by Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd, just made sure the Internet Archive cannot be forged.

Well, sort of. In a blog post published last week, the developer and consultant explained how he used his OpenTimestamps project to timestamp all the Internet Archive’s 750,000,000 files onto Bitcoin’s blockchain. This means that no one — not even the Internet Archive itself — can modify this collection of books, videos, images and other records; not unnoticeably.

Here’s how he did it.

Merkle Trees
The effort is an interesting showcase of the OpenTimestamps project, an open-source and freely available timestamping service.

OpenTimestamps works by combining two cryptographic tools.

The first of these is a Merkle Tree, a cryptographic structure of hashes.

Any piece of data can be hashed, which means it’s scrambled and condensed into a short string of numbers: a hash. This string of numbers is seemingly random; it can’t really be used for anything in itself, not even to reconstruct the original data.

But it can be used as a sort of check. Anyone who has access to the original data can hash this data once again, and will get the exact same hash. Meanwhile, even if the original data is altered minimally (perhaps a picture includes an extra pixel), the resulting hash turns out completely different. A hash proves that the data you have is the exact same data used to create a hash.

A Merkle Tree, then, hashes multiple hashes together. Two hashes become one hash. And another two hashes also become one hash. Then these two resulting hashes become a new hash, so all four hashes are now represented by a single hash. And these four combined hashes can perhaps be hashed together with the hash of four other combined hashes, to once again conclude into a single hash. Etcetera. Because this hashing of hashes can continue in perpetuity, a Merkle Tree can ultimately “store” virtually unlimited amounts of data.

The real magic of a Merkle Tree is that any of the original data included in the tree can be checked against the single remaining hash of a Merkle Tree: the “Merkle Root,” even without requiring any of the other data hashed into the Merkle Tree. You just need to know where in the tree to find the hash.

The second piece of the puzzle is establishing when that Merkle Tree was created.

Bitcoin’s Blockchain
Establishing when a Merkle Tree came into existence is done by utilizing the power of Bitcoin’s blockchain. Literally, Bitcoin’s power-consuming, proof-of-work system guarantees that data must have existed at a certain point in time.

The Bitcoin blockchain is essentially a cryptographic structure, just like a Merkle Tree. But while a Merkle Tree merges hashes into a single compact hash, the blockchain merges them into a timeline. Each Bitcoin block is hashed and included in the next block. That block is hashed too and included in the block after that.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s proof of work makes it so that each of these blocks requires real resources to mine. Right now, this already costs thousands, perhaps even tens of thousands, of dollars per block.

This is what makes Bitcoin’s history immutable.

“Changing history,” for example, by removing a transaction from an old block, cannot be done by simply removing that transaction. That would entirely change the hash of the block that included the transaction, invalidating that block. That would in turn invalidate the subsequent block as well, as it doesn’t include the valid hash from the previous block, and as such it would invalidate all blocks that came after it.

Instead, the only way to change Bitcoin’s history is to completely re-mine it. An old transaction can only be “removed” from a block by mining that same block again, without the transaction. And then you’d need to mine the next block, and the block after that … all the way until you’ve mined the longest chain. (Technically, the chain with the most accumulated proof of work.)

This will become very expensive very quickly. Even without any competing miners, proof of work requires that re-mining a day of Bitcoin’s history should cost hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of energy. With competing miners to catch up on, you need at least a majority of hash power.

Especially with competing miners, rewriting even a couple weeks of Bitcoin history is practically unaffordable for anyone … never mind re-writing a couple of years.

And to top if off, re-writing this much history would be very obvious too. Many Bitcoin users would notice and would possibly take precautions to make it impossible.

OpenTimestamps
OpenTimestamps combines the magic of Merkle Trees with the immutability of Bitcoin’s blockchain.

To showcase it, Todd took 750,000,000 hashes of files from the Internet Archive last week to combine them all into one Merkle Tree. The “root” of that tree, then, was placed into a Bitcoin transaction. He sent that transaction over the Bitcoin network to have it included in the Bitcoin blockchain. This is now a couple of weeks ago and virtually impossible to ever revert.

As a result, almost the entire Internet Archive is now hashed into Bitcoin’s blockchain. Anyone can take any document from the Internet Archive and verify that it existed in its current form four weeks ago. If the hash checks out, the document has not been altered since, nor could it have been created later.

Finally, to make this timestamp actually useful, the OpenTimestamps team — specifically Riccardo Casatta, Luca Vaccaro and Igor Barinov — created an accessible search interface and an in-browser timestamp verifier. With it, anyone can easily browse through the Internet Archive’s database and immediately see whether the records check out with the corresponding hash, as embedded in Bitcoin’s blockchain.

2017/6/14,Bitmain Responds to UASF With Another Bitcoin Hard Fork Announcement,"Major Bitcoin mining hardware producer Bitmain today announced that it may launch a “hard fork” in August. Labeled a “contingency plan,” the announcement is a response to the upcoming user activated soft fork (UASF), as defined by Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 148 (BIP148) — and the wipe-out risk that comes along with it.

After an initial 8 megabyte proposal, Bitcoin Classic, the Hong Kong roundtable consensus, Bitcoin Unlimited, and SegWit2x, this marks the sixth time the Chinese mining giant has announced support for a hard fork in the space of two years.

Here’s what their latest proposal looks like.

Hard Forks, Coin-Splits and Altcoins
On August 1st, a segment of the Bitcoin community will activate the BIP148 UASF. These users and miners will only accept Bitcoin blocks that signal support for Segregated Witness (SegWit), the protocol upgrade proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team. If, at that point, a majority of miners (by hash power) does not signal support for SegWit through BIP148, Bitcoin’s blockchain and currency could split in two: a coin-split.

Now, with Bitmain’s hard fork announcement, it seems there could be a third part to the split … sort of.

Bitmain refers to its announced hard fork as a “UAHF” or User Activated Hard Fork. While perhaps a clever play on UASF, this is not a very accurate term because the “contingency plan” will actually be very explicitly activated by Bitmain — and Bitmain alone.

Moreover, use of the term “hard fork” is questionable in this context as well. Originally, at least, the term referred to a change to the Bitcoin protocol that makes previously invalid blocks or transactions valid. But for it to be a change to the Bitcoin protocol, it arguably at the very least requires the Bitcoin ecosystem to follow these new rules. Under Bitmain’s own stated condition this wouldn’t be the case, at least not to the full extent. 

Rather, the “UAHF” will only be launched in response to a successful BIP148 UASF. It is thus more or less assumed that not everyone will adopt the new rules, which indeed seems likely. Technically, at least, Bitmain’s “hard fork” would be better described as the creation of an entirely new coin that shares a common history with Bitcoin.

For purposes of this article, Bitmain’s version of Bitcoin will be called “Bitmain’s Bitcoin.”

Bitmain’s Bitcoin
So what. specifically, will Bitmain’s Bitcoin look like?

Bitmain announced it will create Bitmain’s Bitcoin exactly 12 hours and 20 minutes after the UASF activation, though this is configurable. At that specific point in time, under Bitmain’s new rules, a block must be included in the blockchain that’s bigger than one megabyte. This will automatically “split” the chain — or create a new chain depending on how you look at it. All existing full Bitcoin nodes would reject this block and ignore this chain, and would continue to follow the chain adhering to Bitcoin’s current consensus rules. 

From that point on, Bitmain will first mine on Bitmain’s Bitcoin chain privately for three days. After these three days, Bitmain will “officially” launch Bitmain’s Bitcoin to the public if three circumstances are met. 

First off, the BIP148 UASF must have been successful enough to have gained significant hash rate. Second, there must be strong market demand for Bitmain’s Bitcoin. And third, the non-BIP148 side of the split must not be doing great, comparatively.

Then, if launched, Bitmain’s Bitcoin will accept bigger blocks. The statement mentions an initial limit of up to 8 megabytes, though this is slightly ambiguous as the same blog post mentions there will be “no hard-coded consensus rule” at all. The hardware manufacturer does add that miners should impose a “soft limit” of less than 2 megabytes, which is really more like a recommendation. Additionally, Bitmain writes that there will be a new protocol limit on “sigops,” which, in short, should counter some potential attack vectors on bigger blocks that could otherwise significantly slow down propagation times. 

For the longer term, Bitmain lays out a “future roadmap” that includes a version of Segregated Witness, Extension Blocks, Bitcoin NG, Lumino, Schnorr signatures, Weak Blocks, and Bitcoin Unlimited-inspired base block size increases up to almost 17 megabytes in two years. Overall, this “future roadmap” part of the announcement does not seem very concrete yet, however. 

What This Means for You, and What This Means for Bitcoin 
The good news is that anyone who holds bitcoins (meaning: their private keys) at the time of a split will receive coins on both (or all) sides of the chain. In other words, you will get free ""Bitmain bitcoins"", which you can keep, sell or spend as long as someone is willing to accept them as payment. Bitmain will even implement replay protection on Bitmain’s Bitcoin, which means that there should be no risk of accidentally spending the same (copied) coin on both chains.

From a broader Bitcoin and scaling perspective, the chances of BIP148’s success may have actually increased, due to this announcement. If Bitmain follows through on their blog post, it means the company will take hash power that could have otherwise frustrated the UASF “off the table,” to mine on Bitmain’s Bitcoin chain. As a result, there is a greater chance that BIP148 miners will claim the longest chain versus non-BIP148 miners, avoiding a coin-split on the original blockchain. Additionally, Bitmain’s blog post seems to have angered some Bitcoin users that were so far undecided, further increasing support for BIP148.

The other scaling proposal in the running is SegWit2x, which is also supported by Bitmain. SegWit2x code should, according to its timeline, be up and running before August 1st. If that deadline is met, it may or may not prevent a coin-split in the first place, depending on its compatibility with the BIP148 UASF. But since this proposal has been mostly developed in private, the status of this project — as well as its (in)compatibility with Bitmain’s “contingency plan” — remains largely unclear.

And of course, in the end, it's possible that neither BIP148, nor SegWit2x, nor Bitmain's Bitcoin will gain much traction. Status quo could prevail, in which case not much would change at all.",Technical,-0.1027
2017/6/15,Samson Mow Introduces Liquid Networks at Blockchain Forum in Canada,"Blockstream’s Samson Mow and Paycase’s Joseph Weinberg unveiled the Liquid network yesterday at the Blockchain Association of Canada’s Government Forum in Ottawa, as a step forward in the ongoing Bitcoin scaling debate.

The Liquid network is a federated sidechain designed to provide new features and benefits to exchanges, users, and businesses by leveraging a sidechain which will process transactions more quickly and efficiently than the main Bitcoin blockchain.

Sidechains like the Liquid network offer automated real-time audit, a secure open protocol, and unforgeable secure tokens, all of which can be used over the open internet.

Samson Mow, Chief Strategy Officer with Blockstream told Bitcoin Magazine:

“There's a preference from some people to scale on-chain with block size increases, but that's a technical dead-end. Scaling off-chain with sidechains means leveraging proven technology that's already available, and will be far superior to static blocksize increases for trivial on-chain scaling gains.”

Mow explained:

“Sidechains allow for new innovations in security models and features, plus the added benefit of faster and more cost efficient transactions - if more businesses were utilizing sidechains for use cases involving recurring transactions, they would take some pressure off the main Bitcoin blockchain.”

He noted that there are strong indications that cryptographic federations and sidechains in general are a good solution to better distribute networks that currently hold the potential for centralized systemic risk.

“In the case of Liquid, it will also improve bitcoin interchange liquidity, and accelerate trading and security for a large percent of today’s global and currency-paired BTC trading,” added Mow.

Mow explained that Liquid networks or “Liquid” represents a point-to-point sidechain that provides near-instant, secure transfer of assets (bitcoin initially), all while user and exchange environments remain separate from the movement of the underlying value.

Paycase CEO Joseph Weinberg told the audience that they have been working with users, enterprises, financial institutions and others on solutions that leverage strong federations.

Weinberg told Bitcoin Magazine:

“Sidechains become even more interesting when you have multiple sidechains from an interoperability perspective. As you tokenize the world, you see this marketplace of all assets being liquefied and then rapidly traversed, similar to how currents move liquid water around the world.

“It's this frictionless flow and interoperability that our economy here in Canada and our geo-political and economic partners around the world are really well positioned to adopt and champion into the mainstream.”

Samson Mow Introduces Liquid Networks' at Blockchain Forum in Canada

Strong Federations and Sidechains
In order to function, a Liquid network requires explicit trust of a group of parties, governance guarantees whereby you have rule adherence and a network of many participants responsible for network consensus.

While accelerating trading in bitcoin, this system will build an infrastructure that leads to a “trustless” exchange for users.

Best use cases include cryptographic assets, central bank currency issuance, land titles/registries, credit issuance and settlement between large institutions.

Mow noted that what Lightning Networks can do for smaller transactions, the Liquid Network can do for larger transactions between companies and exchanges.

Currently, Liquid Beta participants include Bitso, Bitfinex, Bitt, BTCC, Coins.ph, Streami, Paycase, The Rock Trading, Unocoin and Zaif. Discussions continue with other partners.

Bank of Canada Is Interested in Liquid Networks
While in Ottawa, Mow and Weinberg met with representatives from the central Bank of Canada. Weinberg told us:

“We met with the Bank of Canada and had some great discussions with them about blockchain technology, and use cases and systems like Paycase's cross-border transaction platform Traverse and Blockstream's Elements platform.

“There is a sense that the media misrepresented the Bank’s recent comments on the Jasper experiment, which was actually a well-balanced and accurate assessment of the technologies they've trialed to date. I think they're still very much interested in evaluating blockchain technology.”

Weinberg added: “We are also working on other sidechain initiatives that leverage strong federations and confidential assets via the elements project both in Canada and globally that require multi-participant governance guarantees and explicit trust.”

He added that they are excited going forward, not just about Liquid networks but the whole interoperation and weaving of different technology stacks in the ecosystem to enable new use cases and leverage all the great layers of the blockchain stack that are being built around the world.

2017/6/15, Op Ed: Here's Why All Rational Miners Will Activate SegWit Through BIP148,"A segment of the Bitcoin community is preparing a user activated soft fork (UASF), using Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 148 (BIP148). If they go through with it, there could be two types of “Bitcoin” on and after August 1st, which this article will refer to as “148BTC” for the BIP148 side of the split, and “LegacyBTC” for the non-BIP148 side.

At time of the split, 148BTC nodes will no longer recognise the LegacyBTC chain as valid — no matter how much hash power mines on this chain. 148BTC would basically just be its own coin.

But the opposite is not true. Because BIP148 is a backwards compatible soft fork, LegacyBTC nodes will recognise the 148BTC chain as valid if it ever becomes the longest chain (that is, most total proof of work). Once this happens, the entire LegacyBTC chain since the point of split would be “re-orged” away: it would disappear. Then only the 148BTC chain will be left, which this article will refer to as “UnifiedBTC.”

What follows is an examination of the scenario of the BIP148 soft fork under a set of four starting assumptions. And: an explanation of why the game theoretical implications of this scenario suggest that rational miners will activate SegWit through this soft fork.

The Starting Assumptions
This is not the type of article that examines all possible scenarios of the BIP148 UASF. These scenarios are plentiful and as varied as the human imagination.

Instead, this article takes four presumably reasonable starting assumptions and draws the single most likely scenario from there.

These starting assumptions are:

1) BIP148 does get activated, and at least some hash power is attributed to 148BTC no matter what. Or, more specifically, enough hash power is dedicated to this chain to eventually reach the point where mining difficulty is re-adjusted to normal, two-week levels. This is a strong commitment, but keep in mind that almost any amount of hash power would eventually reach this point, while producing hash power becomes cheaper over time.

2) All else being equal, the market would value 148BTC (or UnifiedBTC) more than or equal to LegacyBTC. In other words, if hash power, re-org risks, or related considerations played no part, the market would prefer a bitcoin that has SegWit activated through BIP148 over a bitcoin that does not. Or at least, the market wouldn’t mind it if a bitcoin had SegWit activated through BIP148, and would value it equally to a bitcoin that does not. (This includes a bitcoin that has SegWit activated through a different activation method later on.)

3) Both the market and at least a majority of miners (by hash power) behave in a rational, profit-maximizing way and have sufficient information to do so.

4) There is no hard fork, counter soft-fork, checkpoint or anything like that on the LegacyBTC side of the split. This would equate the creation of a new coin, and just make it so that users and miners can pick and choose as they would among altcoins. That being said, even in most of these cases the game theory described in this article still holds up. (Notably, Bitmain’s claimed “contingency plan” would ensure that it holds up stronger.)

Interestingly, not all of these starting assumptions even need to be true. In the style of a Keynesian beauty contest, it’s actually enough if a majority of miners (by hash power) thinks they are true, or if they think that other miners think they are true, or if they think that other miners think that other miners think they are true... and so on.

It should also be noted that this article omits some nuance; for example, regarding potential hash power attacks, fee levels on different chains, pruned nodes, a possible AsicBoost advantage, or developer support. While all this may skew miners’ behavior to some extent, none of it should fundamentally change the dynamic described here.

The Market’s Options
More than anything else, bitcoin gains value from holders: the people and entities that accept bitcoin in trade and hold on to it as a store of value. This also includes miners after they’ve mined new bitcoins and hold on to them, which Bitcoin’s protocol rule forces them to do for at least 100 blocks after the coins have been mined.

Once the UASF is activated on August 1st, all holders will have a choice of three options:

1) 148BTC or UnifiedBTC

2) LegacyBTC or nothing

3) Both 1 and 2

Option 3 will mostly represent holders who don’t send or receive any coins until the situation is resolved. This has no bearing on the game theory of a BIP148 coin-split, so we’ll ignore this option.

The other two options, 1 and 2, may seem strange to you. You may have thought that there will simply be a choice between LegacyBTC and 148BTC in much the same way the Ethereum split simply resulted in a choice between ETH and ETC. But that's not the case.

This is because if you choose to hold 148BTC, should a re-org happen at any time in the future, you will instead be holding UnifiedBTC.

On the other hand, if you choose to hold LegacyBTC, should a re-org happen, you'd find yourself holding nothing at all.

So holders really have the option between “batches” — not just two types of bitcoins that happen to exist at a specific point in time.

‘148BTC or UnifiedBTC’
When BIP148 activates, under the stated assumption, at least some hash power will be attributed to 148BTC. This could be very low compared to LegacyBTC: perhaps 10 percent, perhaps 1 percent, or perhaps even less. But no matter how low the hash power is, 148BTC will then “exist.”

Now remember that, all else being equal, 148BTC — or UnifiedBTC — should be worth more than LegacyBTC, or at least as much. The market will prefer a bitcoin that has SegWit activated through BIP148 over a bitcoin that does not.

From a pure, trading perspective, then, it’s easy to see why it will make sense to invest in 148BTC at any price lower than (or equal to) LegacyBTC, especially if you’re buying 148BTC with LegacyBTC. If 148BTC trades at a mere percentage of LegacyBTC’s exchange rate, it could potentially offer a 100x return on investment.

Of course, in reality, not all things are likely to be equal. Most importantly, 148BTC may find itself with much less hash power support, which will result in lower utility (slow confirmation times) and lower security (cheaper to perform 51%-attacks).

Nevertheless, keep in mind that this means that low hash power is the main reason why this investment case may not hold up.

Hash Power and Value
In a normal situation, where miners act as rational profit-maximizing entities, hash power tends to follow price. Miners want to make as much money per hash as possible, so they mine the most profitable coin. If a coin gains in value, more miners will point their machines to this coin. When a coin loses value, miners will increasingly switch to another coin or turn their machines off completely. This is clearly seen in the altcoin markets, for example.

However, this coin-split scenario is not a normal situation. Under the stated assumptions, the main reason 148BTC won’t be valued as much as LegacyBTC, is that it may not have as much hash power.

But this means that an increase in hash power should also increase 148BTC’s price.

And that makes intuitive sense. If 148BTC goes from 0 percent of total hash power (between 148BTC and LegacyBTC) to 1 percent, it improves from “unusable” to “more than one set of transactions per day”: not unlike typical fiat transfers — just less of them. At 15 percent hash power, SegWit will activate before the timeout of November 15th, further increasing utility. And at 33 percent, LegacyBTC miners can no longer 51%-attack the 148BTC chain without re-orging the LegacyBTC chain away. Increased hash power would likely increase 148BTC’s price.

Moreover, with only 51 percent of total hash power, 148BTC turns into UnifiedBTC and will therefore account for 100 percent of total value. This suggests that a single percentage of hash power increase would, on average, increase 148BTC’s price by more than a percent.

And the opposite is just as true.

If LegacyBTC ever drops a single percentage from 50 percent of total hash power to 49 percent, it will (eventually) turn into “nothing,” and its value will drop significantly: to zero. By extension, if LegacyBTC ever decreases from 51 percent to 50 percent of total hash power, it should increase the risk of this scenario playing out, which should also decrease its price. And that should also be true for any hash power decrease.

This is important because it flips the normal situation, where hash power mainly follows price, on its head. For 148BTC, increased hash power should further increase price. While for LegacyBTC, decreased hash power should further decrease price.

Game Theory: A Primer
The basic idea behind game theory is that rational players in a game can anticipate the moves of other rational players and make the best mathematical decisions accordingly.

As a simple example, let’s say Alice auctions off a dollar to Bob and Carol. (And for those well-versed in game theory, don’t confuse this example with the better-known and paradoxical dollar auction; we’re keeping it simple here.)

Bob is first to bid, and could bid 1 cent to win a grand total of 99 cents. But of course, Carol could then outbid Bob for 2 cents. Then Bob and Carol could go through the motions of bidding 3 cents, 4 cents, 5 cents… up until one of them bids 99 cents. It makes no sense to bid a dollar for a dollar, while it always makes sense to outbid your opponent up until 99 cents, so 1 cent profit is the maximum each can win.

Now, if Bob and Carol are both rational, they both already know they could win the maximum if they’d just bid 99 cents straight away: they know that’s what they should do if they want to win the maximum. Moreover, if Bob gets to act first, and he knows that rational Carol will bid 99 cents on her first turn, Bob definitely needs to bid 99 cents, or he’ll lose out on his cent.

The important takeaway is that because Bob can anticipate the outcome of a bidding race, and assumes Carol can too, there would be no bidding race. Bob would end the auction with one bid.

BIP148’s Game Theory
Not unlike Bob and Carol in Alice’s auction, rational bitcoin miners can anticipate how other rational bitcoin miners as well as rational bitcoin markets will act after the BIP148 split … in order to prevent a split.

Let’s say the market initially expects 148BTC to gain only 1 percent of total hash power. 148BTC currently doesn’t exist yet, so that would basically be an increase from zero to one.

Now, remember that for 148BTC, increased hash power further increases price, while for LegacyBTC, decreased hash power further decreases price. So if one percent of total hash power were to mine 148BTC, the market should (eventually) push the price of 148BTC higher than 1 percent of the total. Meanwhile, the market should also (eventually) push the price of LegacyBTC down to below 99 percent of the total.

But of course, if the market now expects 148BTC to (eventually) have more than 1 percent of total price, miners should also be expected to (eventually) dedicate more than 1 percent of total hash power to 148BTC, and less than 99 percent to LegacyBTC. After all, hash power also follows price. It always does.

And yet again, if the market expects 148BTC to (eventually) have more than 1 percent of total hash power, this should drive the expected price up even higher. And it should push the expected LegacyBTC price even lower.

As a result, we’re in a situation resembling Bob and Carol's bidding race. 148BTC’s expected hash power increases 148BTC's expected price … which increases expected hash power, which increases expected price. The exact opposite is true for LegacyBTC.

This can ultimately only lead to one conclusion. Both rational markets and rational miners should expect 148BTC to eventually be the only coin standing, as UnifiedBTC.

Now, if miners expect only UnifiedBTC to be left standing eventually, it is of course smart to switch from LegacyBTC to 148BTC before other miners do. And if all miners know that all miners know this, and all miners know that all miners know this, they have only one rational decision to make. Like Bob in Alice’s auction, miners should switch to 148BTC immediately.

Moreover, knowing that all rational miners would switch to 148BTC immediately makes it even more irrational for any individual miner not to switch immediately. He’d be wasting hash power on blocks that would be rejected — orphaned — by other miners.

That is, of course, if miners think the stated assumptions hold up.",Technical,0.9984
2017/6/16,"BIP91: The SegWit Activation ""Kludge"" That Should Keep Bitcoin Whole","Bitcoin’s long-lasting scaling debate appeared to be heading toward a climax lately, with two proposals gaining significant traction. At one end of the fence there is Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 148 (BIP148), a user activated soft fork (UASF) originally proposed by the pseudonymous developer “shaolinfry.” On the other, there’s SegWit2x, an agreement forged between a significant number of Bitcoin companies and miners.

The good news is that both of these proposals have a short-term solution in common: both plan to activate Segregated Witness (SegWit) this summer. The bad news is that the activation method of the two has differed, which could lead to a coin-split.

As of today, it seems this schism will be avoided — at least initially. The SegWit2x development team plans to implement BIP91, a proposal by Bitmain Warranty engineer James Hilliard that cleverly makes the two conflicting activation methods compatible.

Here’s how.

BIP141
The current implementation of Segregated Witness is defined by BIP141. This version is included in the latest Bitcoin Core releases, and is widely deployed on the Bitcoin network. BIP141 is activated through the activation method defined by BIP9. This means that 95 percent of all blocks within a two-week period need to include a piece of data: “bit 1.” This indicates that a miner is ready for the upgrade. As such, SegWit would be activated if the vast majority of miners are ready for it.

Or that was the intention. So far, only some 30 percent of hash power is signaling support for the upgrade. There is a lot of speculation as to why this is the case, but it almost certainly has nothing to do with (a lack of) readiness.

That’s why other activation methods are increasingly being considered.

BIP148
BIP148 is a user activated soft fork (UASF), specifically designed to trigger BIP141.

On August 1st, anyone running Bitcoin software that implemented BIP148 will start rejecting all blocks that do not include bit 1, the SegWit signalling data.

This means that if a mere majority of miners (by hash power) runs this software, they will reject all blocks from the minority of miners that does not. As a result, this majority of miners will always have the longest valid chain according to all Bitcoin nodes on the network. Consequently, all deployed BIP141 nodes will see a chain that includes over 95 percent of bit 1 blocks, meaning SegWit would be activated on the network.

However, if BIP148 is not supported by a majority of miners (by hash power), Bitcoin’s blockchain could split in two. In that case, there would effectively be two types of Bitcoin, where one activated BIP148 and the other did not. This may resolve over time — or it may not.

SegWit2x
SegWit2x (also referred to as “SegWit2MB” or “the Silbert Accord”), is the scaling agreement reached by a numer of Bitcoin companies and over 80 percent of miners (by hash power), drafted just before the Consensus 2017 conference.

For some time, the details surrounding SegWit2x were not very specific. As the name suggests, all that was really known was that SegWit was included in the agreement, and that it included a hard fork to double Bitcoin’s “base block size” to two megabytes.

And, of course, SegWit was meant to be implemented using a different activation method. Like the original BIP141 proposal, SegWit2x was to be activated by miners through hash power. But where BIP141 requires 95 percent hash power support, SegWit2x would only require 80 percent. Moreover, SegWit2x readiness would be signaled using another piece of activation data: “bit 4” instead of “bit 1.”

This makes SegWit2x largely incompatible with BIP141, and especially with BIP148: Different nodes would be looking at different activation bits, meaning they could activate SegWit under different circumstances and at different times; and that would mess up SegWit-specific block relay policy between nodes, potentially fracturing the network.

BIP91
Now, it seems BIP91 has provided the solution.

BIP91 is a proposal by Bitmain Warranty (not to be confused with Bitmain) engineer James Hilliard which was specifically designed to prevent a coin-split by making SegWit2x and BIP148 compatible.

The proposal resembles BIP148 to some extent. Upon activation of BIP91, all BIP91 nodes will reject any blocks that do not signal support for SegWit through bit 1. As such, if a majority of miners (by hash power) run BIP91, the longest valid Bitcoin chain will consist of SegWit-signaling blocks only, and all regular BIP141 SegWit nodes will activate the protocol upgrade.

Where BIP91 differs from BIP148 is that it doesn’t have a set activation date, but is instead triggered by hash power. BIP91 nodes will reject any non-SegWit signalling blocks if, and only if, 80 percent of blocks first indicate within two days that’s what they’ll do.

This indication is done with bit 4. As such, the Silbert Accord can technically be upheld — 80 percent hash power activation with bit 4 — while at the same time activating the existing SegWit proposal. And if this is done before August 1st, it’s also compatible with BIP148, since BIP148 nodes would reject non-bit 1 blocks just the same.

This proposal gives miners a little over six weeks to avoid a coin-split, under their own agreed-upon terms. With a SegWit2x launch date planned for July 21st, that should not be a problem… assuming that the miners actually follow through.",Technical,-0.9657
2017/6/16,The Moonbeam Scaling Network: A “Semi-Decentralized” Scaling Solution,"Bitcoin exchange and hosted wallet provider Luno (formerly BitX) is developing a Bitcoin scaling solution called Moonbeam. Unlike the lightning network, Moonbeam does not require SegWit’s transaction malleability fix and would be able to operate on the Bitcoin network as it is today.

Moonbeam  aims to provide a way for multi-user Bitcoin platforms — such as exchanges, hosted wallets, and payment processors — to easily open standardized one-way payment channels with each other, and thereby offload the Bitcoin network from a growing number of transactions.

How Does it Work?
Moonbeam aims to take advantage of the fact that many Bitcoin transactions occur among multi-user platforms. Using Moonbeam, these platforms can open standardized one-way payment channel contracts with one another to facilitate payments. By taking these transactions off-chain, Moonbeam can reduce transaction fees for those who use it and benefit Bitcoin users generally by reducing congestion in the mempool.

These channels are simple smart contracts in which one party locks up a certain amount of bitcoins for a specified period of time (with the end point referred to as the “timeout”) for the purpose of sending payments to the other party. Before the timeout, the party that has locked up funds can send an unlimited number of off-chain transactions using those locked up bitcoins (until the channel runs out of bitcoins). Each channel involves only two on-chain transactions: one to open the channel and one to close it.

Because these intermediate transactions are off-chain, they are nearly instant. Without the need for a blockchain confirmation, the transactions only take as long as it takes to route an http request (think: loading a simple web page). These transactions would also be cheap. Only two transactions per channel require miner fees, and the rest are essentially free to the platform, though the platform could charge fees to its users.

The one-way payment channels used by Moonbeam are not a new invention. Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto embedded preliminary code for payment channels in the very first release of Bitcoin, and more recent protocol upgrades like CheckLockTimeVerify have further enabled this usecase. Bitcoin platforms could negotiate and implement these smart contracts on the blockchain today.

What Moonbeam aims to do is facilitate the creation of these channels between major payment platforms by using the Domain Name System (DNS) to route communications related to creating and using these channels. This way, high volume platforms can easily discover one another and enter into a payment channel smart contact using the standardized Moonbeam terms. Using the Moonbeam protocol, this process can happen automatically when it is more efficient to open a channel than sending payments on-chain.

Trust
The Moonbeam project overview indicates that it is “semi-decentralized.” It is labeled as such because while the Moonbeam network does not require platforms to trust one another, it does require users to trust their platforms. A hosted wallet with a Moonbeam address is a custodial account, where the platform is managing the funds, and credits and debits user accounts accordingly as users send and receive transactions. Exchanges such as Coinbase operate in this manner; users do not directly control their private keys. Moonbeam can be a useful tool for these services, but it will likely not be a suitable scaling solution for users who prefer to manage their own private keys.

Other Downsides
The Moonbeam specification document also mentions several other potential downsides. Among them is the cost of capital. In order to open these channels, sending platforms must commit capital in the form of bitcoin for a period of time. If the receiver does not use the channel, the sending platform must wait until timeout to regain control of the funds, entailing potentially large financing costs.

Another risk involves the use of DNS. DNS hijacking is an attack that involves rerouting domain name requests to an attacker’s server. These attacks could be used to receive payments over new channels that were meant for the authentic server.

While Moonbeam does not offer the level of decentralization of the lightning network, the fact that it does not require any fork to the network may may make it an attractive solution to Bitcoin’s scaling troubles in the short term. It could be implemented by hosted wallet providers as soon as the project is production ready.

The current state of Moonbeam can be found on the project’s Github.",Technical,0.3182
2017/6/20,Bitcoin Miners Are Signaling Support for the New York Agreement: Here’s What that Means,"As of today, over 80 percent of miners (by hash power) are including the letters “NYA” in the blocks they mine. This follows the publication of letters (translation) in which a group of Chinese Bitcoin companies — notably including most mining pool operators — announced that they would signal support for “the New York Agreement.”

Here’s what this means in the context of Bitcoin Core’s scaling roadmap, the upcoming BIP148 user activated soft fork (UASF) on August 1, 2017, and Bitcoin’s broader scaling debate.

The New York Agreement
The New York Agreement, sometimes referred to as “the Silbert Accord” or “SegWit2x,” is a scaling agreement forged within a significant group of international Bitcoin companies and published just before the Consensus 2017 conference in New York last May. Based on this agreement, a fork of the Bitcoin Core software client is being developed under the name “BTC1.” BTC1 developer Jeff Garzik announced the alpha release of this software last week.

While technical specifics for BTC1 are still being worked out, it seems that rollout of the New York Agreement essentially consists of two stages.

The first stage regards deployment of Segregated Witness (SegWit), the backwards compatible protocol upgrade originally proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team. With 80 percent has power support, BTC1 should actually trigger activation of the SegWit implementation embedded in Bitcoin Core clients and should also be compatible with BIP148 clients as long as activation happens before August 1st. With BTC1’s “official” release date set for July 21st, this should be possible.

The second stage concerns the deployment of the hard fork itself, which is not backwards compatible with older Bitcoin clients. This hard fork would double Bitcoin’s “base block size limit” to two megabytes, which combined with the block size limit increase brought by Segregated Witness should make for a total maximum of eight megabytes of block space. This is scheduled for exactly three months after activation of the first stage. So if the “BIP148 deadline” of August 1st is met, the second stage should go into effect before November 1, 2017.

Through letters published shortly after the announcement of the BTC1 alpha software, Chinese mining pool operators confirmed their intent to honor the New York Agreement. Additionally, they announced to include the letters “NYA” in their “coinbase strings.” That’s what we’ve been seeing today.

So what does this “NYA” string actually mean?

Signaling and Signaling
For each block miners mine, they get to send themselves one transaction that includes brand new bitcoins. This is called the “coinbase transaction.” (Not to be confused with the company “Coinbase.”) Like all transactions, this transaction can include a little bit of extra data that actually has nothing to do with the transaction itself. This is what miners sometimes use to “signal” information to the rest of the world.

But broadly speaking, there are really two types of “signaling.”

The first type is signaling support. This requires that actual Bitcoin software has been written to monitor the signals and, once these signals reach some kind of threshold, something actually activates in all of these Bitcoin clients. For example, code for the Segregated Witness soft fork as included in Bitcoin Core clients, will enforce the Segregated Witness rules once 95 percent of newly mined blocks include a specific piece of data in the coinbase strings. If that happens, all these nodes will actually reject transactions and blocks that break the SegWit rules. (Edit: It should be noted that SegWit signaling doesn't use the coinbase transaction for signaling, but the block header.)

The second type is signaling intent. As opposed to signaling support, signaling intent doesn’t actually do anything on a technical level. Rather, it's literally miners sending a message to the world, which has in the past, for example, been used to state a preference for a potential scaling solution. (While miners can also do this through letters or blog posts, coinbase signaling cannot possibly be faked, so it’s a bit more reliable.)

The recent “NYA” signaling is of the second type. It doesn’t actually trigger any code, but it instead lets the world know that the miners intend to support the New York Agreement. Specifically, they seem to indicate that they will be signaling support for the New York Agreement once the BTC1 client is officially released: presumably by July 21st, or at least in time for August 1st. (Though earlier is possible, too.)

But notably, most miners are not signaling support yet — even though it’d be possible to activate SegWit through existing activation methods implemented in Bitcoin Core or BIP148 clients straight away.

Hard Fork
The technical specifics for BTC1 are still being worked out, and that’s especially true for the hard fork part of it.

Right now, it seems that signaling support for SegWit2x should also trigger the hard fork code to be implemented in all BTC1 clients — but only three months down the road. So if SegWit activates before August, BTC1 users should start accepting, and potentially mining, “base blocks” larger than one megabyte by November. In fact, the first base block on the BTC1-chain, the “cut-off block,” will likely even have to be bigger than one megabyte.

But it’s far from certain that most non-BTC1 clients will follow this chain. Most notably, the odds of Bitcoin Core — currently the dominant client on the network — adopting the SegWit2x hard fork seem slim. None of the regular Bitcoin Core contributors were part of the New York Agreement, none of them support it, and contentious hard forks have so far not been implemented by the Bitcoin Core development team, more or less as a matter of policy. And even if the Bitcoin Core development team does merge the hard fork code, it would require all users to upgrade to this new version, which is probably even less likely.

As such, if BTC1 users — such as the New York Agreement signatories — follow through and actually run the software three months after the soft fork, there will likely be a split in the Bitcoin network. Some nodes will follow a chain with bigger blocks, some will stick to smaller blocks, and there would effectively be two different coins with a shared history.

But it is too soon to say how such a scenario will play out exactly —  or if it will happen in the first place. Three months is a long time in Bitcoin terms and, in the end, neither written agreements, nor signaling intent are binding on a Bitcoin protocol level.

2017/7/3,Countdown to SegWit: These Are the Dates to (Still) Keep an Eye On,"Bitcoin’s very public scaling debate is entering a crucial phase. Two of the most popular scaling proposals available today — BIP148 and SegWit2x — both intend to trigger Segregated Witness (“SegWit”) activation within a month, which means that the protocol upgrade could be live within two.

At the same time, there is a very real risk that Bitcoin “splits.” Both BIP148 and SegWit2x could diverge from the current Bitcoin protocol, which could in turn lead to even more splits.

Here is a list of dates for July, August and beyond to keep an eye on.

This article was last updated on August 8th.



Recap: Segregated Witness Activation


August 2nd update: Most of the information in this section is still accurate, but some of it is a bit outdated now. Keep in mind it was written about a month ago, before many of the recent developments occurred.

First, a brief recap on Segregated Witness and its potential activation methods.

SegWit is a backwards compatible protocol upgrade originally proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team. It has been a centrepiece of the scaling roadmap supported by Bitcoin Core since the protocol upgrade was first proposed in December 2015, and it is implemented on many active Bitcoin nodes on the network today. SegWit is now also part of the “New York Agreement”: an alternative scaling roadmap forged between a significant number of Bitcoin companies, including many miners. And Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 148, or BIP148, is a user activated soft fork (UASF) scheduled for August 1st that also intends to activate SegWit.

The difference lies in how the activation should happen.

The first and original option was proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team. Their SegWit code, defined by BIP141, activates if 95 percent of hash power within a single difficulty period of about two weeks signals readiness before November 15th. Assuming that the miners who signal readiness are actually ready to support the upgrade, risks of a split in Bitcoin’s blockchain and currency are minimal.

However, currently only some 40 to 45 percent of hash power is signaling readiness for BIP141. This is why a segment of Bitcoin users plans to activate SegWit with the BIP148 UASF. Starting on August 1st, their nodes will reject all blocks that do not signal readiness for BIP141. If this proposal is supported by any majority of miners (by hash power), these miners should always claim the longest valid chain, which should activate SegWit on all SegWit-ready Bitcoin clients and avoid a split. But if this proposal is supported by a minority of miners, a “BIP148 chain” would split off from the current protocol.

The New York Agreement, also referred to as the “Silbert Accord” or “SegWit2x,” plans to activate SegWit through BIP91. Like BIP148, all BIP91 nodes would reject any blocks that do not signal readiness for BIP141. But unlike BIP148, BIP91 nodes would only do this once 80 percent of hash power signals that they support BIP91, within a period about two days. This should also minimize the chance of a split.

However, the second step of the New York Agreement is a hard fork to double Bitcoin’s “base block size.” This change, as opposed to Segregated Witness itself, is not backwards compatible, and could therefore lead to a “split” as well.

There is also such a thing as miners signaling intent to support the New York Agreement, but this is effectively meaningless and will be ignored for the purpose of this article.

Now for the dates…

SegWit Timeline

July 14: BTC1 Deployment


The software client that resulted from the New York Agreement is a fork of the Bitcoin Core codebase, called “BTC1.” BTC1’s beta software was released on June 30th. But according to the SegWit2x roadmap, July 14th is the day that signatories to the New York Agreement should actually install the BTC1 beta software and test it for themselves.

This shouldn’t affect regular users or miners much, however.

July 17th update: Deployment of BTC1 is delayed by a couple of days, but not in such a way as to distort the remainder of the timeline.


July 21: BIP91 Signaling to Start


The SegWit2x development team aims for July 21st to be the day that BTC1 nodes are actually up and running, and, importantly, the day that miner signaling should commence.

This shouldn’t really affect regular users either.

But if you are a miner, you may want to help activate SegWit by signaling readiness for BIP91. (This is done by mining “bit 4” blocks; for example, by mining with BTC1 or with Bitcoin software that includes a BIP91 patch.)

July 17th update: Several mining pools have already started signaling support for BIP91, even before the announced signaling date. At the time of publication of this update, the hash power threshold has not yet been met, however.

July 21st update: BIP91 is now locked in. See below.


July 23 (at the earliest): BIP91 Lock In


The precise threshold for BIP91 activation requires that within a pre-defined series of 336 blocks, 269 blocks must signal readiness. That’s some 80 percent of hash power, over about 2 1/3 days. So assuming the SegWit2x roadmap is followed, BIP91 could, at the very soonest, lock in on July 23rd.

Again, this shouldn’t really affect regular users.

But if you are a miner and BIP91 does activate, you now have another day or two to comply with the BIP91 soft fork. If you don’t, you risk mining invalid blocks.

July 17th update: Since a number of mining pools have started to signal support for BIP91 early, the earliest BIP91 lock-in date has moved forward, too.

July 21st update: BIP91 is now locked in. See below.


July 25 (at the earliest): BIP91 Activation


On July 25th, another 336 blocks after BIP91 “lock in”, BIP91 could actually go into effect, at the soonest. Any blocks that do not signal readiness for Segregated Witness (per BIP141) should now be rejected by a majority of miners (by hash power).

This still shouldn’t really affect regular users.

But if you are miner, you should now only mine blocks, and only mine on top of blocks, that signal readiness for SegWit (BIP141). Else you risk having your blocks rejected by a hash power majority.

July 17th update: Since several mining pools have started to signal support for BIP91 early, the earliest BIP91 activation date has moved forward too.

July 21st update: The 80 percent hash power lock-in threshold for BIP91 was reached today (UTC). This means that BIP91 should activate on July 23rd. If at least a majority of miners (by hash power) actually does enforce BIP91 for the next couple of weeks, this should make BIP148 obsolete. For more information, see this article.

August 8th update: BIP91 and/or BIP148 have done its job: Segregated Witness (BIP141) is no past the point of return for lock-in. See below.


July 29: BIP91 ""Deadline""


If Bitcoin miners want to be sure to avoid a “split” in Bitcoin’s blockchain and currency as a result of BIP148 activation, July 29th is a first deadline day for them. 

July 17th update:  Since the next deadline is already missed (see below), July 29th is now the second deadline day for miners, not the first.

To ensure that BTC1’s BIP91 is activated in time to be compatible with BIP148, it should be locked in on this day at the very latest, say, before 08:00 UTC. (That’s 4 am on the U.S. east coast.) But sooner is better: The closer to the deadline BIP91 locks in, the bigger the risk it doesn’t activate in time.

If BIP91 has not activated by this deadline, Bitcoin may well be heading for a chain-split.

If this happens, and if you are a regular user, and you haven’t prepared for a potential BIP148 UASF chain-split yet, you now have two days left to do so. And you really should. This article explains how.

If BIP91 has not activated by July 29th and you are a miner, you now have two days to decide on which chain you will mine on August 1st: on the BIP148 chain, or on the original (“Legacy”) chain. July 17th update: Or perhaps on the Bitcoin ABC chain; see below.

July 21st update: BIP91 is now locked in. See above.


July 31: BIP141 ""Deadline""


If Bitcoin miners want to be sure to avoid a “split” in Bitcoin’s blockchain and currency as a result of BIP148 activation, July 31st is technically the miners’ second deadline day to avoid a split.

On this day (UTC), at the very latest, either BIP91 must activate, or BIP141 must lock in. In other words, if BIP91 did not lock in in time, there must now have been a two-week difficulty period in which 95 percent of hash power signals support for SegWit.

In reality, the chance is small that July 31st actually coincides with the closing day for a difficulty period. And even if it does, it’s unlikely that it will take until this day before it’s clear whether the 95 percent threshold will be met.

As such, both users and miners should have probably already prepared for a potential split, as explained for July 29th. But July 31st really is your last chance to get ready.

July 17th update: As of July 15th, this deadline can no longer be met.


August 1: BIP148 Activation


This is the day BIP148 activates, which makes it the third and final deadline day for miners to avoid a split.

On August 1st, at 00:00 UTC (note that this is still July 31st in the U.S.), all BIP148 nodes will start rejecting any blocks that do not signal readiness for Segregated Witness (per BIP141). If Bitcoin Core’s BIP141 or BTC1’s BIP91 have locked in and/or activated in time, there should be no chain-split.

If neither has happened, a majority of miners (by hash power) now have one last chance to avoid a chain-split: by supporting BIP148 themselves. This would ensure they always (re-)claim the longest valid chain according to all current Bitcoin nodes, and will activate SegWit through BIP141.

If BIP141, BIP91 nor BIP148 have attracted sufficient hash power by August 1st, but BIP148 does gain some traction, the chain could split on this day. If that happens, there will be two types of “Bitcoin,” which we’ll refer to as “148 Bitcoin” or “148BTC” for the BIP148 side of the split, and “Legacy Bitcoin” or “LegacyBTC” for the other side. (This split could resolve over time if 148 Bitcoin ever reclaims the longest chain, or if 148 Bitcoin is abandoned by all miners and users for good, but this is not the focus of this article.)

If you own bitcoin (that is: private keys) at the time of split you should automatically own both 148BTC and LegacyBTC. Though, to access both types, you probably need to download new software. That said, if you are a regular user, it is probably best to initially halt any and all transactions, at least until the situation is more clear. Failing to do so may cost you money! For more information, see this article.

If a split happens and you are a miner, you should have by now decided on which chain you’ll mine, and mine on that chain. (Of course, you can still switch at any time. You may simply want to mine the most profitable chain, for example.)

July 21st update: The 80 percent hash power  activation threshold for BIP91 was reached today (UTC). This should make BIP148 obsolete. However, if a majority of hash power does not actually enforce BIP91 by August 1st, the scenario described here does still hold up. For more information, see this article.

August 2nd update: BIP148 has now activated, and so far all is going well. Miners are mining SegWit-signaling blocks-only, which is compatible with both BIP91 and BIP148, which means that all Bitcoin nodes are united on one chain. Segregated Witness (BIP141) is currently scheduled to lock-in on August 8th.

August 8th update: Segregated Witness (BIP141) is now past the point of no return for lock-in. All Bitcoin nodes are still united on one chain.


August 4: Potential Bitcoin ABC Launch


Although the exact date is not set in stone, August 4th may see the introduction of a new type of “Bitcoin”: Bitcoin ABC.

Major Bitcoin mining hardware producer Bitmain recently announced that if BIP91 does not activate before August 1st and BIP148 is showing signs of life after August 1st, it will launch a “contingency plan.” More recently, the implementation to embody this contingency plan — named “Bitcoin ABC” — was announced at the Future of Bitcoin conference.

Bitcoin ABC will share a common history with Bitcoin up until August 1st, but will, for the first couple of days after that, probably be privately mined by Bitmain. It will also include several new and incompatible protocol rules, perhaps most importantly an increased block size limit.

If you owned bitcoin at the time of split — August 1st, 00:00 UTC — you should automatically own “Bitcoin ABC” as well. But you may, in that case, need to download software to be able to send (and receive) the coins. More information will likely become available if this event occurs.

If you are a miner you should be able to mine Bitcoin ABC on August 4th. (And perhaps sooner.)

July 17th update: It now seems a bit more likely that Bitcoin ABC will launch, regardless of BIP148. This launch is scheduled for August 1st, 12:20 (PM). It may still take a couple of days before Bitcoin ABC becomes widely accessible for miners and users.  At least one mining pool and exchange, China-based ViaBTC, has announced support for the coin, which it will list as ""Bitcoin Cash"", with the ticker ""BCC"".

July 21st update: Contraryto earlier reports, it appears that Bitcoin ABC will not include two-way replay protection. If you want to make sure you don't lose access to your Bitcoin ABC coins, you should not send any bitcoins (whether 148BTC or LegacyBTC) until you have ""separated"" your Bitcoin ABC coins. For more information, see this article. (Also note that Coinbase has explicitly stated that users will not have access to their Bitcoin ABC coins.)

August 2nd update: Bitcoin Cash (BCH), as the new cryptocurrency is now called, launched yesterday. While the project is off to a slow start when it comes to hash power and blocks, trading has opened, and it seems as if the coin could make it.

August 8th update: Bitcoin Cash (Bcash; BCH) is alive and well as an alternative cryptocurrency.


August 15: Potential BIP148 Proof-of-Work Change


While this date is not set in stone either, August 15th could see the introduction of yet another type of “Bitcoin,” which we’ll refer to as “NewPoW Bitcoin” or “NewPoWBTC.”

As a UASF, August 1st’s BIP148 fork should initially be effectuated by users — not miners. Users would start to reject any blocks that do not signal readiness for Segregated Witness (per BIP141). This should incentivize miners to follow the BIP148 chain (ideally, at least for BIP148 users, to the point where it’s the only chain left). But whether this will actually happen remains to be seen. So far, few miners have publicly indicated they will support the UASF.

If miner support on 148 Bitcoin remains low, (some of) its users may opt to implement a hard fork to change the proof-of-work algorithm. This would “fire” the existing group of miners by making their specialized ASIC mining hardware obsolete on the BIP148 chain, and could open the door for new miners — possibly re-decentralising the mining ecosystem back to home users with CPUs or GPUs. (At least temporarily.)

An open BIP148 “working group” on a channel of the ""Bitcoin Core Community"" Slack is currently working out the details to be proposed. But it seems that if by August 15th less than 15 percent of total hash power mines on 148 Bitcoin, this hard fork will be deployed. This would make the split with “Legacy Bitcoin” definite. It could technically also lead to another split on the 148 Bitcoin side, if some of its users decline to join the hard fork that changes the proof-of-work algorithm.

If you are a regular user and owned bitcoin at the time of the August 1st split, and you didn’t spend any until August 15th, you should now also own NewPoWBTC. If you bought or earned 148BTC between August 1st and August 15th, you should now (also) own NewPoWBTC.

But if you did spend bitcoins on any side of the split, that’s not as certain. Again, if you want to be on the safe side, don’t transact at all until the situation becomes more clear. (For more information, see this article.)

If you are one of the few miners that was mining on 148 Bitcoin with ASIC hardware, you may now want to point your hardware elsewhere — or shut it down completely. (This depends, of course, on whether or not it’s still profitable to mine 148BTC or anything else.)

And of course, anyone should by now be able to mine on NewPoWBTC without specialized ASIC hardware.

August 2nd update: As BIP148 has locked in and Segregated Witness seems increasingly likely to activate smoothly, there will almost certainly not be any proof-of-work change any time soon.

August 8th update: Segregated Witness (BIP141) is now past the point of return. BIP148 is virtually made obsolete, and a proof-of-work change will (almost certainly) not be needed.


Mid- to late- August: SegWit Lock In


If miners avoided a chain-split through BIP141, BIP91 or BIP148, Segregated Witness should at the latest lock in between mid-August or late August. This should be a bit a non-event if it happens through BIP91 or BIP148, as it would at this point be expected, and wouldn’t change much for anyone.

But what the lock-in means is that all SegWit-ready clients will start enforcing the new rules in the next difficulty period: after another two weeks. So if you are a regular user and would like to use the new features or want to maintain top-notch security, you now have two weeks to upgrade to software that enforces SegWit.

If a chain-split is not avoided, the situation could become far more complex. By mid-August, there could potentially be one, two, three or maybe even four “Bitcoins”: “148 Bitcoin”,  “NewPoW Bitcoin”, “Bitcoin ABC,” as well as “Legacy Bitcoin”.

At the time of writing this article, it’s hard to say how best to deal with this situation. For a regular user, it’s always best to hold onto your private keys, and it’s probably best not to transact at all until the situation resolves in some way or another. (For more information, see this article.)

For a miner, it’s probably best to just mine the most profitable chain.

August 2nd update: Segregated Witness lock-in is currently scheduled for August 8th. (The exact time and date depends on how fast new Bitcoin blocks are found.)

August 8th update: Segregated Witness (BIP148) is now past the point of no return for lock-in. (Technically, it will lock-in tomorrow; this is now virtually guaranteed.)


Late August to Mid-September: SegWit Activation


If a chain-split is avoided by miners, SegWit should activate around this time. If you’re running a compatible client by now, you can begin to enjoy the new features while maintaining top-notch security.

If a chain-split is not avoided, the situation is (still) too complex to predict.

August 2nd update: Segregated Witness activation is currently scheduled for around August 23th. (The exact time and date depends on how fast new Bitcoin blocks are found.)

August 8th update: Segregated Witness activation is still scheduled for around August 23th. (The exact time and date depends on how fast new Bitcoin blocks are found.)


Late October to Mid-November: SegWit2x Hard Fork (see update)


Toward the end of this year (though potentially even up to early 2018), the hard fork part of SegWit2x should take place. To be exact, this hard fork activates on BTC1 clients three months after SegWit locks in. This activation means that a “base block” bigger than 1 megabyte should be mined, which makes BTC1 clients incompatible with all Bitcoin clients that do not have the hard fork code implemented.

At this point in time, it seems almost certain that not everyone will change their software to support this hard fork. Bitcoin’s development community in particular has almost unanumously rejected the proposal, while several companies have indicated their intentions not to support the change, and not all users seem on board either. As such, this could lead to another chain-split. (Theoretically, this could lead to the fifth “Bitcoin,” though it seems very unlikely there would still be four ""Bitcoins"" by then in the first place.)

How to deal with this situation as a regular users will be announced on Bitcoin Magazine closer to the actual date.

If you are a miner and you were only running the BTC1 client to help activate SegWit with no intention to support the hard fork, you should make sure to switch back to a non-BTC1 client before this hard fork takes place.

July 17th update: As per the implementation of BTC1, this ""2x hard fork"" should actually activate three months after SegWit activation — not three months after (BIP91) lock in. This moves the hard fork date back by about a month, closer to late November or mid-December.

August 2nd update: With Segregated Witness activation currently scheduled around August 23th, the ""2x hard fork"" should happen around November 23th. (The exact time and date depends on how fast new Bitcoin blocks are found. Over a timespan of several months, this could possibly deviate by more than a week from November 22nd.)

August 8th update: With Segregated Witness past the point of no return for lock-in, the ""2x hard fork"" should happen around November 23th. (The exact time and date depends on how fast new Bitcoin blocks are found. Over a timespan of several months, this could possibly deviate by more than a week from November 22nd.) Apart from Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash (Bcash) the ""2x hard fork"" could lead to a third type of ""Bitcoin."" How likely this is to actually happen remains to be seen.",Technical,0.9986
2017/7/6,Voorhees: Bitcoin Will Probably Be Replaced If Scaling Resolution Not Found This Summer,"This week on Let's Talk Bitcoin, Erik Voorhees, CEO of Shapeshift, talks with Epicenter's Brian Fabian Crain and Sébastien Couture.

         Voorhees: Bitcoin Will Probably Be Replaced If Scaling Resolution Not Found This Summer
        
Bitcoin has always been seen as the king of the world of cryptocurrency due to its network effects and first-mover advantage, but ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees thinks bitcoin could be replaced as the top dog if a scaling resolution is not found this summer. Voorhees shared this point of view on the most recent episode of Epicenter with co-hosts Brian Fabian Crain and Sébastien Couture.

The debate over scaling Bitcoin has been the main topic of conversation in the ecosystem for the past two years, but it appears that the network will get the long-awaited Segregated Witness (SegWit) upgrade by August 1st.

During his appearance on Epicenter, Voorhees discussed his support for the SegWit2x proposal, his impression that many Bitcoin users aren’t paying attention to the scaling debate and whether Bitcoin needs an improved system of governance.

Is SegWit2x Bitcoin’s Short-Term Scaling Solution?
SegWit2x, which is supported by a large number of Bitcoin companies and miners, is a proposal for adding SegWit and a hard-forking increase to the block size limit to Bitcoin. Voorhees described himself as a “big proponent” of the proposal during his appearance on Epicenter, saying that it’s the “only viable, actual option to moving Bitcoin forward.”

“I want SegWit on Bitcoin as soon as possible,” said Voorhees. “I also want a hard fork to a larger base block size as soon as possible, and SegWit2x hopefully will make those things happen.”

Voorhees said that he is also bullish on the possible success of SegWit2x due to the declared support of the proposal from over 80 percent of the network hashrate.

According to Voorhees, the activation of SegWit2x will move Bitcoin out of a “trough of misery” that he believes the digital cash system has been in for the past two years, though he also believes the deployment of these changes has the potential to cause some volatility in the near term.

“This stagnation has been really horrible for Bitcoin,” said Voorhees.

In Voorhees’s view, the activation of SegWit2x on the Bitcoin network will lead to a rally in the bitcoin price that “will be unlike anything that people have ever seen before.” He also believes the activation of the scaling proposal will allow everyone in the ecosystem to refocus on building on top of Bitcoin rather than debating over the base protocol.

At one point during his Epicenter interview, Voorhees admitted that he almost doesn’t care which scaling proposal is activated on the network.

“I just want something to happen,” said Voorhees. “If this summer fails to find some kind of resolution to this debate, then I’m pretty bearish on bitcoin, and I think it’ll probably be replaced.”

Bitcoin’s Userbase is Much Larger Than /r/Bitcoin
Voorhees also discussed the Bitcoin community as a whole during his appearance on Epicenter, and he noted that Bitcoin’s userbase is much larger than some may realize.

“The community is so much larger than Reddit, and people that live on Reddit don’t realize this,” said Voorhees.

While the /r/Bitcoin subreddit is still a main hub of the community, Voorhees pointed out that both Blockchain and Coinbase have 10 million users each. By comparison, /r/Bitcoin has roughly 250,000 subscribers.

Voorhees then told a story of going to a recent Bitcoin meetup in Berlin, Germany, where Blockchain CEO Peter Smith asked the audience how many of them had heard of the SegWit2x proposal. According to Voorhees, about 5 percent of the crowd raised their hands.

Does Bitcoin Need a Better System of Governance?
Voorhees’s story about the Berlin meetup eventually turned into a broader conversation of how changes should be made to the Bitcoin protocol. Crain pointed out that some of the newer altcoins coming onto the market, such as Tezos, are heavily focused on the issue of network governance.

“It’s a slippery slope,” said Voorhees. “When you start having structured governance, you start moving toward an organization that can be compromised. As difficult as Bitcoin has been in making progress on this one debate, it also is showing immense resilience to change, which is good and bad — it depends what the issue at hand is. You have to be careful if you want something like a blockchain project to turn into a more traditional-looking organization with a hierarchical structure and certain people who make key decisions. That’s not necessarily the best way that a blockchain should exist.”

Voorhees then admitted that he does not know the best governance model for a blockchain, but he thinks it’s great that there is so much experimentation taking place in this area right now.",Technical,0.9935
2017/7/7,Lombrozo: Bitcoin Core Developers May Never Use Miner-Focused BIP 9 Signaling Again,"One of the key points of contention in the politicization of Bitcoin protocol development over the past couple of years has been the concept of miner signaling. While not intended to be a vote among miners to decide the future of the Bitcoin network, Ciphrex CEO and Bitcoin Core contributor Eric Lombrozo pointed out that miners are now using the signaling process as leverage in the discussion over Bitcoin scaling.

Lombrozo made the comments during a discussion with host Thomas Hunt and Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song on Hunt’s Mad Bitcoins YouTube channel.

“This whole signaling thing is a huge problem that I think created a very terrible narrative,” said Lombrozo.

What Is BIP 9?
BIP 9 is a method of rolling out soft-fork upgrades to Bitcoin. The short description of this process is that soft-forked changes will be enabled once 95 percent of miners have signaled to the network that they are ready for activation, using a trick called “version bits.”

“It was an arbitrary system created by developers in order to coordinate smooth soft-fork transitions,” said Lombrozo. “It was not designed to be a political system for voting on controversial issues ever — that was never the intention.”

Lombrozo also noted that, in the past, soft forks have been deployed on Bitcoin without any special treatment for miners, and BIP 9 was supposed to solve some of the issues miners could face during the deployment of a soft fork.

“It was introduced for the courtesy of miners to be able to reduce their orphan rates and reduce the probability that they’re going to end up mining blocks that are actually invalid — that was the real motivation behind it,” said Lombrozo.

According to Lombrozo, the goal is still to get nodes upgraded and enforce the rules of the soft fork; BIP 9 was simply a technique to coordinate with miners.

The Ciphrex CEO added that there was nothing like miner signaling in the original version of Bitcoin, and Satoshi Nakamoto never used miner signaling for the soft forks that he deployed on the network.

“It was a mechanism that was created way later,” said Lombrozo. “And once this mechanism was created, it was abused and turned against the developers to try to extort stuff. And now it’s being used against businesses to extort stuff from them.”

BIP 9 Does Not Work With Uncooperative Miners
According to Lombrozo, BIP 9 would not have been used for Segregated Witness (SegWit) if the contributors to Bitcoin Core knew then what they know now.

“If we considered that there had been this kind of, like, contentious or adversarial situation, then BIP 9 would not have been used,” said Lombrozo. “We would not have used the signaling mechanism because it obviously does not work under those kinds of circumstances.”

In Lombrozo’s view, miners are now using the effective veto power that comes with the miner signaling process outlined in BIP 9 as leverage in the discussions around scaling Bitcoin. He also believes Bitcoin Core developers may deserve some of the blame for using BIP 9 in the first place.

“But at the same time, we only had the best of intentions at the moment,” added Lombrozo. “We thought we’d gotten through all these disagreements and it seemed like the miners were for it and going to support it … Obviously, the adversarial case needs to be considered because it’s just the nature of this network and the way that it works.”

Lombrozo suggested that miners also used miner signaling as a sort of “propaganda” tool with Bitcoin Unlimited, even though there was no activation mechanism included in the code.

Never Use BIP 9 Again?
According to Lombrozo, miners now think they have some control over the protocol due to the use of the miner signaling process outlined in BIP 9.

“Miners started thinking, ‘Hey, maybe we have control over the protocol because of this whole signaling thing,’” said Lombrozo during his discussion with Hunt and Song.

Lombrozo claimed that “we’re never going to use BIP 9 to deploy anything almost for sure” if SegWit is not activated via the current BIP 9 deployment.

As an alternative, Bitcoin Core could turn to BIP 8, which is a variation of BIP 9 from pseudonymous developer Shaolin Fry that eventually activates a soft-forking change whether miners have signaled for it or not. Miners can still activate the change before it is automatically locked-in on the network, but approval from miners is not required before that lock-in takes place.",Technical,0.2662
2017/7/11,Op Ed: Why SegWit2x Makes No Sense,"A number of Bitcoin companies and miners have agreed to run code that will implement a hard-forking increase to the non-witness data in blocks roughly three months after the activation of Segregated Witness (SegWit). According to some of its proponents, the proposal, known as SegWit2x, is said to be the only viable solution to the Bitcoin scaling debate.

However, agreeing to initiate a hard fork without knowing how speculators will react to such a change comes with risks. If there is not full support for the hard fork from bitcoin holders, the end result could be a split of Bitcoin into two separate cryptocurrency networks, which could cause extreme brand confusion among the general public (depending on the severity of the split).

In addition to the potential risks of a permanent split of the community, SegWit2x also ignores tools that could be used to get the intended benefits of this particular hard-forking increase to capacity without the possibility of a network split.

Perhaps most troubling, SegWit2x ignores the reasons as to why Bitcoin is useful in the first place.

Speculators Call the Shots
While the original Medium post regarding the New York Agreement claimed the signatories accounted for $5.1 billion worth of monthly on-chain transaction volume (more than half of the entire network for April), the general view of SegWit2x from bitcoin holders is unclear at this time. Companies representing large amounts of bitcoin holdings (Digital Currency Group, Coinbase, Xapo, etc.) have signed onto the agreement as well, but we have yet to see speculators have the chance to set a price for the hard-forked chain.

As of now, the hard-fork portion of SegWit2x appears to be contentious, which means exchanges are likely to list both the original chain and the chain with a hard-forking increase to the block size limit. Companies that take custody of their users’ bitcoins will need to allow their users to withdraw both coins.

Although more than 80 percent of the network hashrate has agreed to run the SegWit2x code, it’s possible that speculators will prefer the non-hard fork chain. It’s also possible that a futures market could illustrate this point before the hard fork takes place.

Of course, miners could decide to mine at a loss and not listen to the market, which would theoretically go against the incentives of the Bitcoin system. If miners abandon the chain preferred by users, it’s possible that a proof-of-work change will be needed, as faith in the current miners may be lost.

Such a scenario could be disastrous for Bitcoin, which means miners (and everyone else in the ecosystem) should be incentivized to avoid it. But we’ll have to see what happens.

If These Companies Control Bitcoin, Then a Public Blockchain is Not Needed
The point of Bitcoin is that it allows everyone to have full control over their money without the need for a trusted third party. There is no third party in Bitcoin because no one controls the consensus rules. If someone is in control of Bitcoin’s consensus rules, then they’ve effectively become the third party that the system was designed to avoid in the first place.

With the New York Agreement, the signatories are basically saying they control the rules of Bitcoin (or at least the fork of Bitcoin that they’ve all agreed to run). If that’s the case, then the need for a public blockchain is less clear. Users would effectively be trusting these institutions with the rules of the system and ordering of transactions because they could decide to completely change the rules via a hard fork at any point in time. If the system is no longer trustless, Sybil attacks on the state of the blockchain can be thwarted by having trusted entities sign blocks rather than miners.

With that in mind, it may make more sense to launch a federated sidechain pegged to Bitcoin’s main chain instead of trying to turn the main chain into a trusted system. This would allow the main chain to retain Bitcoin’s core value proposition of permissionless money while the sidechain can process the microtransactions these companies desire.

The signatories of the New York Agreement could become the functionaries of the sidechain, where they’d control the consensus rules and sign blocks. This sort of setup makes much more sense if users are supposed to trust these entities anyway. A much more efficient transaction network can be created when proof-of-work and decentralization are thrown out the window.

In fact, this is exactly what Blockstream’s Liquid sidechain is supposed to achieve early next year. Ironically, some of the signers of the New York Agreement are supposed to be participants in Blockstream’s upcoming federated sidechain.

If there are no goals for SegWit2x other than increasing capacity on the Bitcoin network, then a federated sidechain is a much better alternative. There’s no risk of a chain split, capacity can be increased exponentially higher than the twofold increase offered by the hard-fork portion of SegWit2x, and other features, such as Confidential Transactions and faster block times, can also be implemented.

Put in this perspective, SegWit2x is completely nonsensical. I’m not sure what the New York Agreement will lead to over the next few months, but it appears to be unnecessarily risky.",Technical,-0.296
2017/7/13,Op Ed: The Value of Sidechains and Leveraging Their Potential,"Since Bitcoin’s launch in 2009, there has been a growing interest in tapping the potential of decentralized cryptocurrencies. However, any modifications to the consensus layer, the critical part of any cryptocurrency, must be handled with caution. Compared to other internet protocols, this makes it harder for Bitcoin to adopt new features and meet new demands. This is why sidechain technology has been proposed: It allows for the transfer of digital assets, including bitcoin, across different blockchains.

While most cryptocurrencies are incompatible, assets are not interchangeable; “fusion” lets sidechains build the financial ecosystem of cryptocurrencies. Using sidechains, we can easily create smart contract-based stocks, futures and other derivatives; there could be thousands of sidechains pegged to Bitcoin, all serving different purposes and having different features. Meanwhile, all of these sidechains benefit from the robustness, and maintain the coin scarcity, of the main chain.

So far, some of the sidechain solutions on the market include BTC Relay by ConsenSys, Rootstock by RSK, Elements by Blockstream and non-Bitcoin sidechains like Lisk.

BTC Relay
BTC Relay, born from the Ethereum Foundation and developed by ConsenSys, is believed to be the first functional sidechain project — although it’s technically perhaps better described as an “atomic swap.” The main principle of BTC Relay is that it connects the Ethereum network with the Bitcoin network in a safe and decentralized way.

BTC Relay allows users to verify Bitcoin transactions through smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. As such, the sidechain mechanism allows user to send transactions, not only to another address or account, but also to other blockchains.

Specifically, BTC Relay uses Bitcoin’s block header to create a tiny version of the Bitcoin blockchain. Ethereum Dapp developers can then verify the Bitcoin network activity by connecting to the BTC Relay smart contract. (It does so through a dedicated API.)

As a result, a typical use case of BTC Relay could look like this:

1. Alice and Bob agree to use the BTCSwap contract (user contract) to trade. Alice wants to buy ETH from Bob. Bob sends his ETH to the BTCSwap contract and the ETH will be locked.

2. Alice then sends BTC to Bob, and — importantly — she wants the BTCSwap contract to be informed so that the BTCSwap contract can release Bob's ETH deposit to her.

3. Alice calls the BTC Relay function using the Bitcoin transaction and the BTCSwap contract address. After the BTCRelay function has confirmed that the bitcoin transaction is valid, the BTCSwap contract will be triggered and will verify the Bitcoin transaction.

4. After the BTCSwap confirms the legitimacy of the BTC Relay address, Bob’s ETH will be released to Alice and the transaction is completed.



Rootstock
Rootstock (or RSK) is the first universal smart contract platform secured by the Bitcoin blockchain. Its goal is to implement complex smart contracts on a sidechain, adding value and functionality to the Bitcoin network.

The way this works is that when a Bitcoin user wants to use two-way anchors, he sends a transaction to a multi-signature address. The key holders of this wallet, the “federation,” can (for example) consist of several well-known companies.

The RSK blockchain uses the public key associated with the funding transaction to store the smart bitcoin (SBTC). This means that the private key that controls the bitcoins in this transaction can be used to control a corresponding amount on the RSK blockchain.

Although the public key and the private keys are similar, each blockchain uses a different format to encode addresses. This means that the addresses on the two blockchains are different.

Elements
The Elements sidechain is an open-source sidechain project developed by Blockstream. Like Rootstock, the project adopts two-way pegging to Bitcoin. In addition to smart contracts, the project also introduces many other innovative features, including private transactions, Segregated Witness and new instruction code to support more functions, among others.

Lisk
Lisk is a new generation of blockchain platform that adds each application to a separate sidechain of Lisk.

Users who have experienced Bitcoin and Ethereum are probably aware that features and data are added to the main blockchain, which leads to rapid blockchain bloat. Extra large block sizes require a long time to synchronize, which is a painful experience.

Lisk's sidechain model instead provides a way to solve the problem of network congestion under high transaction volume. Users just need to download the corresponding sidechain for a specific use case when using the relevant application. This greatly reduces the sync time for downloading unnecessary data and facilitates the efficient operation of the entire Lisk network. Also, the speed of the Lisk network promises to continue to accelerate over time, which ought to give it a special advantage.

A Model of the Bytom Sidechain
Bytom is an inter-operational protocol for multiple “byte assets.”

In order to operate different on-chain assets running on Bytom, developers can create a tiny version of a sidechain. Let’s use, for example, one version called “XRelay,” which functions similar to BTC Relay. Dapp developers can then connect to the API of XRelay via a smart contract to verify the network activities of “X Chain,” the alternative blockchain XRelay connects with. In this way, cross-chain communication can complete transactional and dividend distribution contained within the contract.

Bytom will support multiple types of digital assets (for example, gold, silver, etc). Each asset will be identified by an asset ID, which will be based on the “ODIN” protocol. With various asset IDs, we can confirm the categories of that asset.

The Bytom chain sorts all assets into two categories: the Bytom token (BTM) and all other digital assets. BTM is the native currency of the Bytom blockchain, which is a special token distributed to miners and other participants in the ecosystem. BTM is based on a Proof-of-Work mechanism to encourage miners to join in the system in a random and anonymous way.

The BTM could be used for

Costs of asset transactions, including the cost of running the smart contract;

Dividends of income assets; and

Deposits for asset issuance.

If the asset issuer, for example, decides to use BTC as dividends, he can lock in the corresponding amount of BTC via a sidechain and convert it into BTM at market rate. This process is executed by the type of Relay contract described through a cross-chain operation.

For example, if we want to swap BTM with Bitcoin, we can do it using a Bytom chain contract like this:

bytomchart
Sidechain technology is appropriate for the mission of Bytom: to build a market where “byte assets” and assets on different blockchains can interact and be exchanged freely. Bytom will facilitate the exchange, interoperation and flow of byte information and byte assets that are stores of value.

2017/7/15,Bitcoin Miners Miss the First BIP 148 “Deadline”,"Bitcoin miners at large have missed the first BIP 148 “deadline” to prevent a “split” in Bitcoin’s blockchain.

As Bitcoin’s scaling dispute appears to be heading for a climax, the next couple of weeks could prove pivotal. One scaling solution in particular, Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 148 (“BIP 148”), is scheduled to trigger activation of Segregated Witness (SegWit) on August 1, 00:00 UTC. As a User Activated Soft Fork (UASF), all users that run a BIP 148 node will then start rejecting any and all blocks that do not signal support for SegWit by the “deadline” — or, perhaps more accurately, “ultimatum” — set by BIP 148 users.

BIP 148 and SegWit are backward-compatible protocol upgrades, which means that non-upgraded nodes will still accept SegWit-signaling and SegWit-utilizing blocks. Therefore, if a majority of hash power in one way or another adopts SegWit before August 1, all current Bitcoin nodes would follow the same blockchain.

However, if only a minority of miners activates SegWit through BIP 148, Bitcoin’s blockchain and currency would “split” in two. This would result in two types of “Bitcoin”: one that activated BIP 148 and one that did not, while even more types of “Bitcoin” could emerge as a result. A split between BIP148-nodes and non-BIP148 nodes would last at least until a majority of hash power joins the BIP 148 chain, or until the BIP 148 chain is abandoned by all users and miners for good.

Miners essentially have three options to avoid such a split. This first option was to lock in SegWit before August 1 through the activation mechanism proposed by Bitcoin Core and implemented in many nodes on the network. This required 95 percent of hash power to signal support for the upgrade within a two-week difficulty period. Specifically, such a difficulty period consists of 2,016 of these sequential blocks, which means that a minimum of 1,916 blocks must signal support. Or, in other words, if more than 100 blocks — at least 101 of them — do not signal support for SegWit within a single difficulty period that ends before August 1, this BIP 148 deadline is missed.

Ignoring extreme statistical deviations or other unexpected events, the final difficulty period to end before August 1 started on Friday (UTC). And out of the first day and a half worth of blocks within this difficulty period, only about half of them signaled support for Segregated Witness. This means that the threshold of 101 blocks not signaling support has now been reached.

With two more BIP 148 deadlines ahead, the first one was probably also the most likely to be missed. Its threshold was the hardest of the three to achieve as it required the highest level of hash rate to succeed. Additionally, a large majority of miners (by hash power) indicates that they will activate SegWit through BIP 91 instead. This is the next BIP 148 deadline.

This next deadline will be on July 29. This is the last day that BIP 91 can activate in time to be compatible with BIP 148. In order to do so, 80 percent of hash power must have signaled support for SegWit2x within 2 1/3 days. As such, miners should at the very latest start signaling support for BIP 91 on the 26th of July. Though like the now-missed BIP141 deadline, which is technically not until August 31, the BIP 91 deadline could actually be either missed or met before July 29 as well.

If this next BIP 91 deadline is missed too, miners will have one more chance to avoid a “split.” A majority of hash power would have to activate SegWit through BIP 148 itself by August 1, 00:00 UTC. Alternatively, a majority of hash power could switch to the BIP 148 chain even after August 1 to reunite both chains, but this will likely cause significant disruption on the Bitcoin network(s), and potentially a loss of funds for users not aware of the risks.",Technical,-0.9771
2017/7/17,"BitPay CEO Stephen Pair Talks Bitcoin Hard Forks, SegWit2x and Sidechains","BitPay has been very much focused on the issues around transaction capacity on the Bitcoin network lately, which eventually led them to support the New York Agreement (also known as SegWit2x). In comments shared with Bitcoin Magazine, BitPay CEO Stephen Pair clarified the company’s view on the SegWit2x proposal and hard forks more generally.

While Pair has indicated that BitPay is working on off-chain payment solutions unrelated to the often-touted lightning network, BitPay would also like to see on-chain capacity increase by way of a hard fork during this “critical stage” of the technology’s adoption by more users.

In the interview, Pair noted that BitPay understands the concerns around implementing a hard-forking increase to the block size limit, but he also added that SegWit2x is the best option for scaling available right now.

You can read all of Pair’s responses to questions from Bitcoin Magazine below.

Bitcoin Magazine: When you were on Let’s Talk Bitcoin a few months ago, you said you didn’t think a hard fork would be a good idea at the time and Bitcoin would still be fine if it never forked, but now you are pushing SegWit2x. So, what changed?
Stephen Pair: Actually, I said that I didn’t think a contentious hard fork to Bitcoin Unlimited was the best way of increasing on-chain capacity.

Our view is that you need balance between the cost of putting a transaction in the blockchain and the cost of running a full node. Both will get increasingly expensive as Bitcoin adoption grows, but the system doesn’t make any sense to us if either one is substantially more expensive than the other.

At the moment we are in favor of SegWit2x because it is the least contentious option for activating SegWit (which will enable layer 2 payments innovation) while simultaneously alleviating congestion in the short term. Our view might be different if Bitcoin wasn’t at a critical stage of adoption (it is), or 2 MB blocks were a risk to the system (it isn’t), or layer 2 payments were production ready (they aren’t). At some point even layer 2 payments are going to put an immense amount of capacity pressure on layer 1.

The debate in the community is no longer primarily big block vs. small block; it is extremists on either side vs. moderates. SegWit2x allows most of the community to remain on the same chain for at least a little while longer. If SegWit2x fails, then we will likely have a chain split sooner rather than later, which, by the way, isn’t necessarily all bad. It would allow more freedom for people to pursue their vision of scaling. In many ways a split would make Bitcoin twice as likely to succeed.

BM: In a perfect world, would you prefer to activate SegWit now and then take a wait-and-see approach on a hard-forking increase to the block size limit?
SP: No, we believe a modest on-chain capacity increase is important as well. The concerns that many people have about doing so are related to increasing the cost of running a full node, the governance precedent it might set, and that increasing on-chain capacity becomes the path of least resistance and will reduce the incentive for layer 2 innovations. We fully understand and share these concerns, as I believe most supporters of SegWit2x do, but we still believe it’s the best of the available options.

BM: What are your thoughts on implementing a big block sidechain (federated or Drivechain) as a way to increase capacity while not affecting system requirements for running a main chain full node? Or would you prefer an extension block?
SP: There are many fans of Drivechain at BitPay and we are very optimistic about it. In fact, as we were working with the bcoin team on extension blocks, the topic of Drivechain came up quite a bit. I really wanted to figure out if there was an opportunity to enhance the extension block work into Drivechain (and there may yet be). The extension block implementation was simply a way of achieving a block size increase without requiring a hard fork, but we don’t view it as a long-term capacity solution.

I also want to mention UASF. While we like the idea of miners making informed decisions related to consensus rules based on the needs of their users (like us), we think an activist-led deployment of a soft fork is extremely dangerous. The plan for deploying extension blocks would likely have taken a very similar approach. We believe that the only appropriate and peaceful response to a failure to gain the support of the hashrate majority would be to create a safe hard fork with re-org and replay protection. In order to protect itself, we think the community should unambiguously reject the notion of an activist-led soft fork deployment.

Lastly, BitPay is going to follow the hashrate majority in the immediate and foreseeable future. That means that whatever consensus changes the hashrate majority adopts, we will as well. That is really the only option for us and our customers. In the longer term, if a fork of Bitcoin emerges that we think might better serve our needs and the needs of our customers, we may evaluate a transition to that fork. But at the present time, we believe the consensus changes embodied in SegWit2x are acceptable.",Technical,-0.1027
2017/7/18,This New Tool Can Help Bitcoin Users Deal With Stuck Transactions,"Samourai Wallet is becoming increasingly popular as a wallet that focuses on privacy and security for its users above all else, but a recent tool released by this wallet’s team of developers has a focus on user experience. The new app, called Bitcoin Afterburner, allows users of many different bitcoin wallets to boost transactions that have become stuck due to low fees.

The app works for transactions that have been sent or received, and it is compatible with all BIP 39 and BIP 44 wallets. Examples of compatible wallets include Mycelium, Blockchain.info, Airbitz and Electrum.

To get more details about Bitcoin Afterburner and the concept of fee bumping in general, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to the anonymous CEO of Samourai Wallet.

“Afterburner is one more example of how we are experimenting and developing ways of monetizing our business without resorting to accepting fiat or exposing our users to harmful KYC/AML collection,” said the CEO.

Samourai Wallet monetizes the Bitcoin Afterburner app by adding a $5.99 fee for helping users with their stuck transactions. This fee is added to the child-pays-for-parent (CPFP) transaction that is used to bump the user’s bitcoin transaction fee. CPFP is a process by which the recipient of a transaction can spend the inputs of an unconfirmed transaction by using them in a new transaction that has a higher fee (and incentivizes miners to mine both transactions at once).

The full question and answer session with the CEO of Samourai Wallet can be read below.

Bitcoin Magazine: Will fee bumping eventually become the norm on Bitcoin?
Samourai Wallet: We believe that over time as legitimate transactions start to fill block space, and a fee market begins to mature, wallets that have implemented sophisticated fee management mechanisms such as fee bumping will provide their users with the most competitive transaction fees and confirmation times. The tech is there today, the challenge — and it isn't a small challenge — is entirely UX. We're working on this today while others are playing catch-up.

BM: Could you compare and contrast this app with the transaction accelerators offered by ViaBTC and BTC.com?
SW: The difference between the miner operated TX Accelerators is that Afterburner is not an off-chain 1-to-1 with a specific miner. Instead, Afterburner broadcasts a bitcoin transaction to all miners using the standard bitcoin p2p network. All the miners on the network compete for the new transaction with the higher fee, meaning it often works much quicker than the miner operated TX Accelerators. Afterburner was very much a defensive response to the miners who have been blocking SegWit activation and broadcasting empty blocks, some of those same miners are the ones who run the TX Accelerators.

BM: Is Bitcoin Afterburner getting much use so far?
SW: Afterburner has a good number of installs, but not many paid 'Boosts.' A few days after we released Afterburner the transaction backlog that was driving up fees and confirmation times completely dried up. The fees required for next block confirmation dropped from 300 sat/b to 25 sat/b. Once the mempool gets saturated again, we will have a much better idea of the potential utility of the app.

BM: Why do you think more wallet providers don’t offer this sort of service?
SW: Many wallet providers — inexplicably the most well-funded ones are the most guilty — haven't invested any time into proper fee estimation and management until very recently. A misguided industry-driven quest to make the bitcoin wallet for “grandma” resulted in an unusable bitcoin wallet for actual users. Samourai has focused from inception on actual bitcoin users first.

BM: Do you think this sort of fee bumping will eventually be free? Does Samourai Wallet offer fee bumping like this natively or do they need to use this separate app?
SW: Samourai Wallet provides the exact same functionality as Afterburner natively. Afterburner was designed to allow users of any other BIP 44 HD wallet to boost their stuck transaction using CPFP (Child-Pays-for-Parent) under the hood. Hopefully they move over to Samourai Wallet if they are satisfied with the service. In addition to CPFP-based boosting more advanced users may opt-in to RBF-based boosting which is also available in the wallet. Both options are available to Samourai Wallet users free of charge.",Technical,0.1779
2017/7/20,"SegWit or Not, Bitfury is Getting Ready for Lightning With Successful Bitcoin Main Net Test","While Segregated Witness (SegWit) activation is looking more likely by the hour, Bitfury is getting ready to deploy a version of the Lightning network with or without the protocol upgrade.

The blockchain technology company, perhaps best known for its Bitcoin mining pool of the same name, successfully sent real bitcoins over a test version of the Lightning Network this week. Interestingly, Bitfury’s implementation of the technology is compatible with the current Bitcoin protocol and is therefore functional even without SegWit.

“This is a major accomplishment by our technical team and an important step forward for the Lightning Network and the growth of Bitcoin,” Valery Vavilov, CEO of The Bitfury Group, said in a statement.

Lightning Network
The Lightning Network is a highly anticipated second-layer scaling solution that allows for cheap and instant (micro)payments. Cleverly leveraging Bitcoin’s basic scripting capabilities, Lightning users should be able to make a virtually unlimited number of transactions, where only a minimal proportion of them are recorded on Bitcoin’s blockchain, thereby boosting Bitcoin’s scalability. Meanwhile, all users remain in control of their own bitcoins at all times, maintaining the trustless properties of Bitcoin itself.

“The Lightning Network has the potential to solve Bitcoin’s scalability issue and provide instant payment functionality. By demonstrating that the Lightning Network can function now, Bitfury has cleared the way to increased transaction processing and further adoption of Bitcoin,” Vavilov said.

Bitfury’s Lightning implementation is based on LND, which is being developed by Lightning Labs.

For its demo, the Bitfury software team created two Lightning transactions. One of these is a straight transaction from one Lightning node to the next, effectively simulating a payment channel between two users. Since it was only a test, Bitfury only made one transaction — but it could have made thousands back and forth at no extra cost.

The other test was a single-hop transaction, which better simulates the main purpose of the Lightning Network. Users pay each other through a mutual third party, without requiring any trust in this third party. While the Bitfury software team only made one transaction on this channel as well, it could, once again, have made thousands back and forth between all three parties, at no extra cost.

Since Bitfury’s test took place on the main net, the funding and settlement transactions are recorded on Bitcoin’s blockchain and can be seen by any typical block explorer.

Tests and SegWit
Bitfury’s is not the first successful test of the Lightning Network. Several companies, including Lightning Labs, Blockstream, ACINQ as well as Bitfury itself have experimented with their implementations of the technology. But since most of these companies are working on versions of Lightning that rely on Segregated Witness, these tests were limited to Bitcoin’s testnet and Litecoin. Likewise, major wallet service Blockchain has sent “Thunder” transactions over Bitcoin’s main net. But while Thunder resembles the Lightning protocol, it isn’t quite as trustless or decentralized.

As such, Bitfury is the first company to get a version of the Lightning Network up and running on the current Bitcoin protocol.

“We released this first experimental version of the Lightning Network for Bitcoin because we think the Lightning Network is an essential technology for Bitcoin and would love to see it made available as soon as possible,” Vavilov said. “We are proud that our developers found a way to adopt the Lightning Network for Bitcoin without SegWit. It’s a huge step forward for Bitcoin scalability.”

Regardless, the CEO noted that he is hopeful that SegWit will activate on the Bitcoin network. With BIP91 currently getting close to its activation threshold, it seems increasingly likely that SegWit could be live within a month. This would allow for a version of the Lightning Network that offers an improved user experience.

Vavilov:

“The Lightning Network will be the most effective when used with SegWit, which is why we are fully committed to SegWit’s implementation, and we will continue working on a version of the Lightning Network that is compatible with SegWit.”  

Bitfury, which started out as a Bitcoin miner, has grown to become one of the largest private infrastructure providers in the Blockchain ecosystem. Part of this effort, the company has been supporting the development and implementation of the Lightning Network for well over a year. Bitfury previously also co-designed and successfully tested Flare, a payment-routing solution for the Lightning Network.",Technical,0.743
2017/7/21,BIP 91 Has Locked In. Here’s What That Means (and What It Does Not),"It looks as if Bitcoin is getting Segregated Witness.

Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 91 (BIP 91) just locked in. Up to 90 percent of all hash power signaled support for this soft fork, which implies miners intend, in turn, to trigger Segregated Witness (SegWit) activation. By extension, this should make BIP 148 obsolete and August 1 a non-event.

But SegWit is not certain. In fact, on a technical level, SegWit is not any closer to activation at all.

BIP 91
Segregated Witness, defined by BIP 141, locks in if at least 95 percent of miners (by hash power) signal support for the upgrade within a two-week difficulty period. To do so, miners need to embed a piece of data called “bit 1” in the blocks they mine.

Importantly, this is technically the only way for SegWit to activate right now. And this threshold has not yet been met.

But there are alternative strategies to try and trigger this threshold “indirectly” — like BIP 91.

BIP 91 is a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal proposed by Bitmain Warranty engineer James Hilliard. It is compatible with the New York Agreement and backed by a number of Bitcoin companies and mining pools. It is also compatible with BIP 148, another strategy to trigger the BIP 141 threshold indirectly.

Miners have been signaling support for BIP 91 over the past couple of days through another piece of data, “bit 4.” Once 269 blocks within a 336-block window included bit 4, this BIP 91 soft fork locks in. This threshold was just met.

This means that after another 336 blocks, a little over two days from now, all BIP 91–compatible nodes will reject any block that doesn’t include bit 1.

As long as a majority of hash power enforces BIP 91, this majority should eventually control the longest valid chain according to all Bitcoin nodes. And as this chain consists of bit 1 SegWit-signaling blocks only, it would in turn lock in SegWit on all SegWit-ready nodes by mid-August. SegWit itself should then be live on the Bitcoin network after a two-week “grace period” by the end of that month.

If all goes well …

What Could Go Wrong?
Although well over 80 percent of hash power has signaled bit 4 for BIP 91 lock in, this doesn’t actually guarantee anything. Most importantly, it doesn’t in itself mean that these miners will signal bit 1 for SegWit.

Indeed, so far, most miners don’t. Currently, the proportion of miners signaling bit 1 is still far lower than BIP 91 activation would suggest. It is even lower than 50 percent.

Moreover, BIP 91 will probably be enforced by hardly any economically relevant nodes; that is, nodes operated by users that accept bitcoins as payment. Almost no Bitcoin users on the network recognize BIP 91 or its bit 4 signaling at all, and will therefore continue to accept blocks with or without bit 1.

BIP 91 will, instead, be enforced by hash power alone. This in turn means that a majority of miners (by hash power) could back out of BIP 91 with little more than reputational damage. They could continue to mine blocks that do not signal bit 1, even after BIP 91 activates in a few days. As long as these miners are in a majority, they will still control the longest valid chain: valid according to most miners, and valid to most users.

Furthermore, any minority of miners and the few nodes that do enforce the BIP 91 soft fork would then be forked off the Bitcoin network. In a few days from now, these miners would mine (on top of) blocks that almost only they themselves would care for, while most of the rest of the entire Bitcoin network would completely ignore them.

With this week’s bit 4 signaling, a majority of miners have effectively made a statement that they intend to start to activate the SegWit soft fork within a couple of days. But for now, that’s really all it is: a very public, blockchain-based statement of intent.

Actual SegWit activation should start next week, if miners stick to their stated intent.",Technical,0.7364
2017/7/26,Four Visions for Scaling Bitcoin: A State of Digital Money Panel,"At the recent State of Digital Money event in Los Angeles, Bitcoin scaling was the topic of conversation for a panel consisting of Airbitz CEO Paul Puey, derivatives trader Tone Vays, Yours CEO Ryan X. Charles and Bitcoin Core contributor Eric Lombrozo. During the panel discussion, each participant was able to share his vision for how Bitcoin should be scaled to handle a much larger userbase.

Ciphrex CEO and Bitcoin Core Contributor Eric Lombrozo
For Lombrozo, scaling Bitcoin is about getting the greatest gains in terms of throughput increases while also limiting the amount of risk and security vulnerabilities involved in those improvements.

“Obviously, if you have just a few entities that are validating the transactions for everyone, then that creates a point of attack or a single point of failure,” said Lombrozo. “Part of the whole philosophy of Bitcoin is you should be able to validate your own transactions.”

Lombrozo added that scaling Bitcoin means users are able to validate their own transactions without necessarily being forced to validate everyone else’s transactions as well.

“That’s the trick,” said Lombrozo.

An example of this method of scaling Bitcoin is the Lightning Network, in addition to other Layer 2 protocols.

From Lombrozo’s perspective, using a blockchain for every transaction is like going to court every time a deal is made with a counterparty. The Lightning Network allows users to interact directly rather than dealing with the blockchain as a third party of sorts to process the transaction.

In the past, Joseph Poon, who is a co-author of the original Lightning Network white paper, has shared similar comments related to the use of Bitcoin’s underlying blockchain as a court for smart contracts.

“Instead of viewing [the blockchain] as simply a payment system, if you view it as a smart contracting system, which enables the blockchain to act as a dispute mediation system, viewing the blockchain as a judge is a lot more understandable and a lot more powerful,” said Poon at the 2016 MIT Bitcoin Expo.

Lombrozo added that second-layer protocols like the Lightning Network act as a sort of paper IOU to bitcoin’s gold — except in the case of the Lightning Network, the user knows they will always be able to redeem the paper for gold.

In addition to Layer 2 protocols, Lombrozo would also like to see different signature schemes implemented in Bitcoin to lower the resource requirements of operating a full node. Schnorr signatures are an example of such an improvement that has been in development for Bitcoin.

Another key point made by Lombrozo during the panel discussion was that different players in the Bitcoin ecosystem desire different features in the protocol; for example, long-term holders may not care as much about $10 on-chain transaction fees as those who have built businesses around the use of the blockchain for coffee purchases or other low-value transactions.

In summary, Lombrozo referred to a user’s ability to only need to validate their own transactions (while still remaining secure) as the “low-hanging fruit” of scaling Bitcoin.

Yours CEO Ryan X. Charles
While Charles claimed he was happy to see progress made on the eventual activation of Segregated Witness (SegWit) via the activation of BIP 91, he also added, “SegWit doesn’t go far enough.”

From Charles’s perspective, SegWit will not sufficiently lower on-chain transaction fees, which he sees as the key issue for users at this time. In his view, much lower on-chain transaction fees are needed for mainstream adoption of Bitcoin to occur.

According to Charles, the main disagreement between various parties when it comes to the best way to scale Bitcoin has to do with how much transactional activity should happen on the blockchain, as opposed to secondary layers of the network.

“I am very much in favor of radical increases to the block size,” said Charles.

Charles added that it would take 30 years to send every person in the world a bitcoin transaction with the current 1MB block size limit.

“That just doesn’t work from the point of view of mainstream adoption of bitcoin,” said Charles.

Charles also noted that the Lightning Network white paper stated that a 130MB block size limit would be necessary for mainstream adoption to be possible, even with various Layer 2 scaling options.

According to Charles, the key question to answer is: How does Bitcoin get from 1MB to 10GB blocks?

“Computers get faster and cheaper,” said Charles. “It doesn’t just have to be technical software and cryptographic optimizations.”

Derivatives Trader Tone Vays
When Vays spoke about his vision for scaling Bitcoin, he first noted that the digital cash system may not be able to do all of the things that were promised in the early days. He specifically mentioned privacy, security, instant transactions and cheap payments as examples of features that were promised by Bitcoin enthusiasts back in 2013.

“In reality, having all of those things at once is almost impossible,” said Vays. “There’s a chance Bitcoin can’t do all that.”

Vays reiterated Lombrozo’s point about different users wanting different features in Bitcoin. In his view, the censorship-resistant properties of the system should be viewed with the highest level of priority.

“The reality is a censorship-resistant payment method is way more important,” said Vays. “You have so many other ways to pay for your cup of coffee, but you don’t have a lot of ways to donate to Wikileaks. You don’t have a lot of ways to buy “other” things...”

Last year, Vays published a post on his blog where he examined some of these use cases involving censorship resistance.

Vays added that he trusts the current group of contributors to Bitcoin Core, the reference implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, to focus on this priority of censorship-resistant digital cash.

For Vays, the next area of focus for developers after the activation of SegWit should be privacy-focused improvements, such as MimbleWimble and Confidential Transactions.

Airbitz CEO Paul Puey
Before talking about anything else, Puey stated that he is very much for the activation of SegWit. However, he then shared his belief that much more on-chain capacity is needed on the Bitcoin network, as Charles had previously stated.

“We’re not going to be able to live with a 1MB block, and it was an arbitrary number,” said Puey.

Puey added that computers are now four to five times more powerful than when the block size limit was originally added to Bitcoin by the system’s creator. He also indicated that the correct “magical number” to define the block size limit is hard to figure out, which is why he believes the free market should decide.

“I don’t think the developers should make that decision,” said Puey.

Puey did not elaborate on how the free market would be able to make this decision. It’s unclear if he was talking about Bitcoin Unlimited’s concept of emergent consensus or simply users choosing between different blockchains with different block size limits.

The Airbitz CEO then prefaced the rest of his comments with the fact that he still has a tremendous amount of respect for the people who have been contributing to Bitcoin Core over the years as they’re trying to solve an incredibly hard problem.

Puey noted that he, as a developer, knows his limitations when it comes to developing a proper user experience for software applications.

“How many of you people want the developers designing the user experience of your protocol, your application [or] your website?” Puey asked the audience.

In Puey’s view, the idea that every Bitcoin user is going to run their own full node, even at a 1MB block size limit, creates a flawed user experience and will prevent the technology from being adopted by the masses.

“Every party in this debate wants decentralization, but they all define it differently,” Puey added.

While Puey suggested that more users running their own full nodes is helpful, he also shared his belief that having greater adoption of bitcoin as a currency would also help the system become more resilient to attackers.

“The more people that are using it, the more that the economy is dependent on it, the harder it is to stomp out a technology,” said Puey.

Puey concluded his response to the scaling question by stating that he was happy to see BIP 91 help end the stagnation in the adoption of protocol improvements.

2017/8/1, A Beginner’s Guide to Claiming Your “Bitcoin Cash” (and Selling It),"Bitcoin Cash (sometimes referred to as Bcash, and mostly using the tickers BCH or BCC) launched today. Anyone who held bitcoin at 12:20 p.m. UTC should have an equivalent amount of BCH attributed to their Bitcoin private keys.

In our beginner’s guide to surviving the BIP 148 split, which was subsequently updated to also cover the Bitcoin Cash launch, we explained how to secure your private keys so you could be sure to access your BCH. At the time of writing that article, much was still uncertain about how this event would play out.

Much is still uncertain, but to the extent that the situation can be understood at present, this article explains how you can claim — and potentially use — your BCH.

Author’s note: If you want to play the BTC/BCH markets as soon as possible, and you are fine with taking risks and/or you really know what you are doing, this article is probably not for you — it’s a beginner’s guide.

Last updated: August 21

Take Your Time
The good news is that, if everything went according to plan, Bitcoin Cash enforces strong replay protection. This means you shouldn't be able to accidentally spend your BTC when you mean to spend BCH, or vice versa.

As such, if you don’t care about BCH at all right now, you don’t need to do a thing. You can just keep using bitcoin as you always have. If you ever change your mind (and don’t lose your Bitcoin private keys in the meantime), you can still claim your BCH at any point in the future.

Likewise, if you want to hold on to your BCH long-term, you also don’t need to do anything right now. You can keep using BTC as if nothing happened; just make sure to never lose your private keys.

(Though in both these cases, it could come in handy to keep some records of the Bitcoin addresses that stored your bitcoins at time of the split. This is not strictly necessary, but your future self may thank you if you do it regardless. You should be able to find this information in your wallet of choice, though it differs a bit per wallet.)

Now let’s assume you do care about BCH right now, at least enough to want to sell your share.

If you followed the advice outlined in our beginner’s guide, the good news is that you should be in full control of your Bitcoin private keys. This means you now hold BTC as well as BCH.

The bad news is that it’s not necessarily easy or safe to claim your BCH straight away. If you are not careful, you may accidentally expose your private keys while claiming your BCH. And because these are the same private keys that secure your BTC, this could lead to your BTC being stolen. Needless to say, you want to avoid this! You almost certainly stand to lose much more from losing your BTC than you stand to gain from, say, selling your BCH fast.

Therefore, you are going to want to take your time and make sure you understand what you are doing well enough to do it without exposing your private keys. Your BCH isn’t going anywhere. And in part because the situation is still developing, even this article may contain accidental errors …

Access Your Coins
In our previous beginner’s guide, we explained how to secure your private keys and recommended different wallet options. Here, you can find, per option, how to access your BCH.

Full Node Wallet
Our first recommendation was to use a full node wallet, like Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots. These wallets store your private keys in a dedicated folder on your computer. You can make a backup of this folder using the menu in your wallet, and select: ""Backup wallet"". Once you’ve done this, you should be able to import this backup into a Bitcoin Cash full node, like Bitcoin ABC.

However, to be on the safe side at this point in time, we are not fully comfortable recommending any Bitcoin Cash software. It is all very new, developed within a short timeframe, and the peer review done on all this software has probably not been as extensive as it usually is within the Bitcoin space. It is therefore probably wise to not import your private keys in such software right away; instead, wait to see if there are any reports of problems.

Update, August 8: We have not yet received or seen any reports of problems.

Furthermore, some Bitcoin Cash full node wallet software, like Bitcoin ABC, conflict with Bitcoin software, such as Bitcoin Core. It is therefore not recommended to install a Bitcoin Cash full node wallet on the same computer. Instead, it’s best to install it on a completely different computer. It is on this computer that you can import your wallet backup and have access to your BCH.

If you are not exactly a beginner, there is one alternative option. NBitcoin developer Nicolas Dorier created a splitting tool, which allows you to split your BTC from your BCH. However, this tool requires you to work in the command line of your operating system; if you know how to do this, you probably don’t need this article.

Update, August 21: Coinomi published a blog post explaining how to access your BCH using their wallet. This includes instructions for full node wallets.

Paper Wallet
Our second recommendation was to use a paper wallet. This advice was given in the context of storing your coins long-term in particular. But if you want to access your BCH, of course you can do this right away.

Unfortunately, however, not many wallets actually support directly importing your private key(s) — and less so for BCH. One wallet that does allow for this option in Bitcoin is Electrum. Therefore, the BCH version of Electrum, dubbed “Electron Cash,” should allow you to do this, too.

However, Electrum itself has issued an official warning concerning Electron Cash. Electron Cash is not properly vetted and therefore not guaranteed to work as advertised. This is a big risk, and we recommend against using it for now. (This may change in the future.)

Update, August 8: We have not yet received or seen any reports of problems.

That said, if you do choose to opt for this solution (at your own risk!), make sure to at least take two additional precautions. First, run the software on a different computer as the computer you run Electrum on, if you run Electrum. (In fact, it’s probably best to use it on a different computer than the one where you hold any bitcoins or any other sensitive data, for that matter.)

Additionally, first move the BTC from your paper wallet to a new Bitcoin address (like a new paper wallet) before you do anything with BCH! That way, even if the Electron Cash wallet manages to steal your private keys, or the computer you use is insecure, the damage should be limited: these Bitcoin private keys won’t hold any BTC anymore. (Make sure not to send BTC to this same paper wallet later on either, though.)

Update, August 21: Coinomi published a blog post explaining how to access your BCH using their wallet. This includes instructions for paper wallets.

Hardware Wallet
Our third recommendation was to use a hardware wallet, as listed on bitcoin.org. Two of these hardware wallets in particular, Trezor and Ledger, have gone through the effort of offering you access to your BCH. So if you have one of these wallets, you’re in luck: this is probably the safest and easiest way to access your BCH.

Ledger has published a blog post explaining how to access your BCH, which you can find here.

Trezor has also published a blog post on how to claim your BCH, which you can find here. Update: Trezor has removed BCH for now, due to a bug in their Bitcoin Cash backend server. Don't worry, your funds are secure. Update: This issue is now fixed.

The third hardware wallet, Digital Bitbox, has published an FAQ on how to access your BCH. However, note that this wallet recommends using Electron Cash, which is not guaranteed to be secure. See the above section on paper wallets for more details.

The last hardware wallet, KeepKey, has also published a blog post on Bitcoin Cash. At the time of writing, it seems you won’t be able to access your BCH quite yet; keep an eye on their blog for updates.

Other Bitcoin.org Wallets
If you didn’t take these three recommendations, perhaps you used one of the other wallets listed on bitcoin.org.

Once again, whichever of these wallets you used, your BCH should be safe and there’s no rush to claim them. But actually being able to claim them may differ a bit from wallet to wallet.

Most wallets use a recovery seed. This phrase essentially holds your BTC private keys, and therefore also your BCH private keys. As such, you should be able to access your BCH by inserting this seed into a dedicated BCH wallet.

However, at this point in time there are no BCH wallets available yet that allow this and which we can confidently recommend using. If BCH becomes somewhat of a success over time, this will probably change. It’s probably best to just wait until this is the case. (If it ever becomes the case.)

Until then, you can just keep using BTC without worrying about your BCH.

Update, August 3: Various wallets have issued statement on BCH, and how you can claim your funds. See this Reddit post post for a series of links.

Update, August 7: Coinomi has integrated BCH into their wallet, and uses a private key seed compatible with several of the wallets listed on bitcoin.org. And if you were using the BTC.com wallet, you should also have access to your BCH.

Update, August 21: Both Coinomi and BTC.com have published blog posts explaining how to access your BCH through these wallets, even if you were using different wallets on August 1st.

Other (Non-bitcoin.org) Wallets, Exchanges, etc.
If you did not follow our advice, and instead stored your BTC in any other wallet, or on an exchange, or anywhere else, you may or may not still be able to claim your BCH. In this case, you’ll have to figure out for yourself whether this is the case or not, and how to do so.

Update, August 3: Various wallets have issued statement on BCH, and how you can claim your funds. See this Reddit post post for a series of links.

Update, August 21: Both Coinomi and BTC.com have published blog posts explaining how to access your BCH through these wallets, even if you were using different wallets on August 1st.

Using (or Selling) Your BCH
Once you have claimed your BCH, you can use it however you please. Just like any other (alt)coin, you could for example sell it for BTC, or perhaps spend it somewhere, or move it to another wallet, etcetera.

Update, August 3: Not many exchanges currently enable BCH deposits. At time of writing, HitBTC and ViaBTC do allow this, but we are not comfortable recommending either of these services for now. There is no guarantee you will actually receive BTC after you've sold your BCH on these platforms, and possibly little repercussion if you don't. It's probably best to wait until a more established exchange enables BCH deposits, and use this instead.

Update, August 7: More exchanges are opening up BCH trade and deposits, including (but not limited to) Bitfinex, Kraken, Changelly and Shapeshift.

Update, August 8: Be careful to only send BCH to specific BCH-addresses, and BTC to specific BTC-addresses. While they look (and technically are) the same, the two networks are fundamentally incompatible.

Further, there are three more factors to keep in mind before doing so.

The first factor is privacy. Your addresses are identical for BTC and BCH. This means that whenever you spend your BCH (for example, to send them to an exchange), you do not only reveal your BCH addresses but also your BTC addresses. This can in turn reveal a lot about your current holdings as well as your past and future transactions, and can by extension even reveal such data about people or entities you transact with. Make sure you are comfortable with giving up this data if you are going to send your BCH to an exchange or anywhere else. (There may be more privacy-friendly options to trade your BCH available in the near future, but these aren’t ready yet.)

The second factor is mostly theoretical at this point, but worth mentioning nonetheless:  security. When you spend from a BCH address, you do not reveal your private key, but you do reveal your public key (which is not the same as your Bitcoin address). This strips away one layer of cryptographic security, even for your BTC addresses. It shouldn’t mean (and hopefully doesn’t mean) that your BTC are insecure right now, but there is an increased chance that your BTC aren’t secure at some point in the (far) future when this particular cryptographic standard is weakened. It is therefore best to move your BTC to a new address.

The third factor was already mentioned but bears repeating: if you’re using insecure software to claim your BCH, your BTC may be at risk. This is why it’s probably best to move your BTC to a new address or even a whole new wallet with a new wallet seed before you start meddling with BCH. That way, if you do mess up with insecure BCH software, you shouldn't lose your BTC.

(Additionally, if you move your BTC to one of your own addresses before touching BCH, you reduce the risk of replay attacks — but as mentioned, if all goes well this shouldn’t be a factor in the first place.)

So, to Recap …
1. You don’t have to do anything if you don’t want to, and there is no rush. If your private keys are secure, your BCH are secure.

2. If you want to use your BCH in any way, it's probably best to first move your BTC to a whole new address that you control, or even to a whole new wallet generated from a new seed. (But don’t lose your old private keys or seed: these still hold your BCH!)

3. Once you know what you’re doing, move your BCH either to a new address or wallet that you control, or perhaps to an exchange to sell, or whatever it is you want to do with your “free money.”",Technical,0.9992
2017/8/8,The Point of No Return: Segregated Witness Will Lock In on Bitcoin,"Segregated Witness (SegWit), the highly anticipated protocol upgrade proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team, just reached the point of no return for lock in. This means that SegWit will be live on the Bitcoin network in a little more than two weeks from now.

“It's been a long and hard process, but we've learned tremendously along the way. I look forward to the next generation of use cases and applications this will enable and to watching the ecosystem mature”, said Eric Lombrozo, Ciphrex CEO, Bitcoin Core contributor, and one of the authors and main advocates of Segregated Witness.

Lock In
Segregated Witness, defined by Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 141 (BIP141), was deployed using an activation mechanism (BIP9) that requires 95 percent of all miners (by hash power) to signal support for the upgrade within the span of a two-week difficulty period. That’s at least 1916 blocks within 2016 blocks, to be exact.

This threshold has just been reached. While the current difficulty period will not end until tomorrow, all blocks in this difficulty period are signaling support for the upgrade so far. This now totals over 1916 of them.

It took a while to achieve this threshold, largely in part because bigger mining pools on the Bitcoin network were refusing to adopt the upgrade, regardless of their technical readiness.

""In hindsight, it’s become clear that miner activation of soft forks cannot be relied upon when there exists a divergence of interests between miners and users. In the cooperative case, it is a tried and tested mechanism which, if done correctly, is known to work smoothly. However, in the adversarial case it simply does not work,” Lombrozo wrote in an article about SegWit activation.

This is why SegWit was eventually adopted through a couple of slightly complex “kludges.”

Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 91 (BIP91), a (mostly) miner-enforced soft fork, had already activated a little over two weeks ago. This soft fork requires all blocks to signal Segregated Witness support for an entire difficulty period, triggering the lock-in on SegWit-ready nodes — all blocks that do not should be rejected by the network. So far, this has indeed been the case.

On top of that, BIP148, an activation mechanism enforced by users, started rejecting all blocks not signaling support for Segregated Witness over a week ago, on August 1st.

SegWit
A viable way to deploy Segregated Witness on Bitcoin via a soft fork was discussed in the Bitcoin development IRC chats and subsequently presented by Blockstream engineer and Bitcoin Core contributor Dr. Pieter Wuille in late 2015 at the Scaling Bitcoin workshops in Hong Kong. It was subsequently adopted as a centrepiece in the scaling roadmap endorsed by the Bitcoin Core development team. The technology was implemented and officially released in Bitcoin Core 0.13.1 in October of 2016.

In short, this upgrade allows for the separation of transaction data and signature data within Bitcoin blocks. This solves the long-standing “malleability bug” in the Bitcoin protocol, which in turn allows for more flexibility when programming new features on top of Bitcoin and offers additional benefits like a modest block-size limit increase.

“Most importantly, SegWit means a drastic simplification in how we can design protocols that can work atop Bitcoin without having to change consensus rules,” Lombrozo noted. “But it also affords the introduction of new features at the consensus layer to support better cryptography and more sophisticated smart contracts.“

Lombrozo added:

“And, of course, it also increases raw capacity by allowing for bigger blocks and making future block size increases more feasible.”

It will now take another two-week difficulty period for the soft fork to actually activate. At that point, all SegWit-enforcing Bitcoin nodes, which almost certainly represents the majority of the Bitcoin ecosystem, will start rejecting any transactions and blocks that do not follow the new rules. As a backwards-compatible soft fork, however, this should not affect non-upgraded nodes much: These will continue to function as normal.",Technical,-0.296
2017/8/19,A Bitcoin Social Media Storm Hit BitPay This Week: Here's Why,"The Bitcoin community is not taking kindly to BitPay this week. Influential developers are accusing the major payment processor of fraud, Bitcoin users on social media are calling for boycots, bitcoin.org is removing recommendations of the company’s products, and NBitcoin developer Nicolas Dorier has launched an initiative to fork some of BitPay’s projects altogether.

Here’s why.

Bitcore
The controversial issue has to do with Bitcore.

Bitcore is a type of Bitcoin node developed by BitPay. It is specifically designed to offer a development platform, on top of which it is easy to build all kinds of Bitcoin applications. Anyone can use this open-source tool; some of the better-known applications that utilize it include video-streaming service Streamium, Trezor’s web interface and BitPay’s own Copay wallet.

Within the next a couple of days, most likely on August 23, the long-awaited Bitcoin protocol upgrade Segregated Witness (SegWit) will activate. Seemingly in response to this upgrade, BitPay published a blog post titled What Bitcore Users Need to Know to Be Ready for SegWit Activation

But not everyone is happy with the contents of this blog post…

The “Major Risk” That Is (or Isn’t) SegWit
The first problem is not the most important problem, but it is worth mentioning, regardless. It concerns the topic of the blog post itself: Segregated Witness.

In the blog post, BitPay states:

Nodes which fail to upgrade to support SegWit will face major security risks, including the risk of double-spend transaction fraud.
This appears to be a bit of an exaggeration.

Segregated Witness is specifically designed to be backwards compatible. Regular nodes that do not upgrade remain part of the Bitcoin network. And importantly, since SegWit was activated by a unanimous hash-power majority, all miners should be enforcing the new rules. As such, transactions that are invalid according the new rules should never be accepted in any Bitcoin blocks at all. Even non-upgraded nodes should never see these invalid transactions confirm.

It is true that — like every other soft fork before SegWit — there are some increased risks for non-upgraded nodes. And in an additional blog post, BitPay does provide more details and nuance regarding the situation.

But the somewhat alarmist tone of the first blog post seems a bit unnecessary. Therefore, to many it appears to have had the specific goal of pushing users toward a software upgrade for very different reasons.

Which brings us to the next point…

The “Upgrade” That Is (or Isn’t) Bitcoin
While BitPay’s alarmist tone seemed like an unnecessary means, it’s the end that really ticked so many people off.

As per the “New York Agreement,” a significant group of Bitcoin companies, mining pools and individuals plans to adopt an incompatible set of protocol rules by November. Dubbed “SegWit2x,” and implemented in the BTC1 software developed by former Bitcoin Core contributor Jeff Garzik, this project would “hard fork” an increase of Bitcoin’s block weight limit, allowing for blocks of up to eight megabytes. (Whether this should technically be called a hard fork or an altcoin is debatable, but never mind that for now.)

The problem is that, while a significant group of Bitcoin companies — including, indeed, BitPay — signed on to the New York Agreement, this agreement currently does not have industry-wide consensus. Most notably, Bitcoin’s development community has almost unanimously rejected the proposal. There is also a long list of companies that never signed onto the initiative in the first place; in fact, some of them are actively opposed to it. And more informal metrics, like social media sentiment, opinion polls and network node count generally also show limited support for SegWit2x.

As such, it is likely that SegWit2x would split off to create a new blockchain and currency, not unlike what Bitcoin Cash (Bcash) did. Unlike Bcash, however, SegWit2x currently has no intention of picking a new name, nor does it plan to implement safety precautions like replay protection. (Replay protection would prevent the “same” coin from accidentally being spent on both chains.) For all intents and purposes, the companies behind SegWit2x appear to be set to claim this coin is the “real” Bitcoin, while the coin that follows the current Bitcoin protocol won’t be.

This approach is controversial. Many Bitcoin users that do not support the hard fork may prefer to keep using Bitcoin as is, without worrying about added (replay) risks or other inconveniences caused by SegWit2x. And if two different coins claim the name “Bitcoin,” it could lead to much confusion, for obvious reasons.

Regardless, in BitPay’s blog post, which speaks of an “upgrade” for Bitcore users in preparation for SegWit, the payment processor actually directs readers to download the BTC1 software; that is, the software that embeds the SegWit2x protocol, rather than the current Bitcoin protocol. It therefore appeared that the company was really trying to get Bitcore users to switch to a whole new coin, which BitPay will consider “Bitcoin.” And the payment processor initially did so without so much as warning Bitcore users that following these instructions would make them incompatible with the current Bitcoin protocol by November.

Herein lies the concern: BitPay must have known that this advice is controversial. Failing to mention the risks or consequences made the blog post seem deceptive.

The Hash Power That Supports (or Doesn’t Support) SegWit2x
Finally, after BitPay faced initial blowback for its blog post for reasons described, it included an addendum. In it, the payment processor writes:

[O]ur instructions follow this version of Bitcoin because over 95% of Bitcoin miners have adopted Segwit2x.
While this addendum provides a little bit more clarity, it is once again a bit of a questionable statement.

Perhaps most importantly: If BTC1 indeed hard forks in November, BitPay right now has no way of knowing how much hash power will really be mining on the SegWit2x chain.

While it is true that mining pools currently representing a supermajority of hash power signed on to the New York Agreement, mining pools usually don’t have full control over the hash power that is pointed toward their pools. Much of this hash power actually belongs to individual miners (“hashers”), who could switch to a new pool with the click of a few buttons. (For example, when another mining pool, Ghash.io, reached over 50 percent of total hash power on the network a couple of years ago, hashers were also urged to move to different pools.)

Furthermore, even if a specific mining pool does control its hash power, nothing in the New York Agreement says these pools should mine on the SegWit2x chain exclusively. Since miners typically dedicate their hash power to maximize profit, it is very possible that this hash power will be attributed to different chains according to the value of the coins on these chains. (This is what usually happens between altcoins. Similarly, just over the past couple of weeks, some signatories to the New York Agreement have already begun directing some hash power to the Bcash chain.)

In its addendum, BitPay appears to be ignoring these dynamics. Once again, this has an air of deceptiveness.

In BitPay’s Defense…
All that said, it should be noted that the risks are still limited, even if users follow BitPay’s instructions.

This is because BitPay is not (currently) suggesting that users run BTC1 software to send and receive transactions. Rather, BitPay is advising users to connect their Bitcore nodes to a BTC1 node as a “border node.” This means that the BTC1 node will essentially act as a network filter to reject all transactions invalid under the new SegWit rules.

Until the hard fork in November, using BTC1 as a border node shouldn’t do any harm whatsoever. BTC1 is compatible with the Bitcoin network until that point in time, and indeed enforces the new SegWit rules.

If no further action is taken, the BTC1 border node would switch to the SegWit2x blockchain by November. But even then, the current Bitcore nodes that are used to send and receive transactions will not make that switch. As such, BTC1 nodes would only let SegWit2x transactions through, which would then, in turn, be rejected by Bitcore nodes. This incompatibility between the two nodes actually means that no blocks would come through at all.

As such, no one would send or accept (confirmed) payments in a different coin than they mean to. In a worst case scenario, the whole setup essentially shuts down.

While the blog post appears deceptive in some ways, BitPay’s advice shouldn't, in itself, cause a of loss funds.

Shortly before publication of this article, BitPay CEO Stephen Pair said in statement to Bitcoin Magazine:

This was unfortunately not the way I had intended this conversation to begin. I will have more to say on this topic in the near future, and feel I owe it to the community to say something. Unfortunately, it may take a little while for that communication to happen as I have other matters demanding my attention at the moment.",Technical,-0.9267
2017/8/22,Why Bcash Mining Shouldn't Affect Bitcoin Much (But Bitcoin Mining Could Ruin Bcash),"For the past couple of days, Bitcoin Cash (Bcash or BCH) was more profitable to mine than Bitcoin (BTC). This has resulted in miners switching from Bitcoin to Bcash, causing a significant speedup of blocks on the Bcash chain, to the point where several dozens of blocks were found per hour. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin blockchain had slowed down significantly; in some cases only one or two blocks were found each hour.

In the short term, therefore, Bitcoin users were inconvenienced: they had to wait longer for their transactions to confirm, and they had to pay more fees to get them confirmed quickly.

In the longer term, however, this dynamic could make the Bitcoin Cash chain very unstable.

Here’s why.

Theory Versus Practice: Assumptions
It should first be noted that, for simplicity's sake, this article makes some assumptions that do not quite (or necessarily) hold up to the full extent in reality.

For example, the article will assume that all (or most) miners mainly care about short-term profits, it will assume that miners can switch between different blockchains at no (or little) cost, it won’t take into account that miners need to wait 100 blocks before they can spend their block rewards, and more.

Perhaps more importantly, the article will also assume that Bitcoin block rewards are more valuable than Bitcoin Cash block rewards. At the time of writing this is the case, by a relatively large margin. Both Bitcoin and Bcash miners are awarded at least 12.5 new coins per block, but BTC is about six times more valuable than BCH. On top of that, Bitcoin blocks contain significantly more fees.

While the reality of the situation is more complex than this, the overall dynamic should hold up — at least until and unless Bcash block rewards become more valuable than Bitcoin’s.

Normal Mining Dynamics
Miners mine to turn a profit, or at least that’s the assumption for this article. They invest resources — time, electricity, hardware, and more — in return for coins.

Mining profitability is determined by the value of the block reward, and the “difficulty” to mine a block. If the difficulty is higher, miners need to invest more resources to find a block. If the difficulty is lower, miners need to invest less.

Notably, what doesn’t actually matter for profitability in the short term, is how many other miners (by hash power) are mining on a particular chain. If many miners are, for example, mining on the Bcash chain, it just means that all these miners find Bcash blocks faster for a while.

This situation does self-correct over time, when the difficulty adjusts. On both Bitcoin and Bcash, difficulty adjusts once every 2016 blocks, which is “supposed” to happen every two weeks. If these 2016 blocks are found in less than two weeks, difficulty adjusts upwards, so the next 2016 blocks will be harder to find. If these 2016 blocks are found in more than two weeks, difficulty adjusts downwards, so the next 2016 blocks will be easier to find.

These adjustments happen relative to how much faster or slower blocks were mined than they were “supposed” to, but it can increase or decrease fourfold (x4 or x0.25) at most.

Bitcoin Versus Bcash
Now, since one Bcash block reward is currently worth about seven times less than one Bitcoin block reward, Bcash can only be more profitable to mine if its difficulty is more than seven times lower. (This has been the case for the past few days.)

But if that occurs, something interesting happens. From the very moment that Bcash is more profitable to mine, it immediately becomes more profitable to mine for all miners. In this hypothetical, all miners would immediately abandon the Bitcoin chain, and instead mine Bcash exclusively.

Of course, this can’t go on forever. If there are so many miners on the Bcash chain, the 2016 blocks will be found extremely fast. (This has been the case for the past few days.) As such, the next difficulty adjustment comes very fast too; potentially within a day or two. (This just happened.) Importantly, because that’s much too fast, the difficulty now adjusts upward by a lot: probably fourfold. (This just happened.)

That’s where Bcash's problems start.

At this point, Bcash’s difficulty is so high that Bitcoin is once again the most profitable chain to mine on. As such, after a lull of about two days, all miners should now switch back to mining Bitcoin.

Bitcoin’s difficulty, meanwhile, was already pretty high. Once all those miners switch back, the 2016 blocks may or may not be found a bit faster than usual. But nothing out of the ordinary.

As such, even after the 2016 Bitcoin blocks are found, not much changes. Bitcoin would still be more profitable chain to mine. Profit-maximizing miners would therefore all continue to mine on Bitcoin only.

And once the next difficulty period is over, once again, nothing will change. Bitcoin would still be more profitable for all miners.

Meanwhile, on the opposite end of the equation, no miners would mine on Bitcoin Cash whatsoever. It's not as profitable to mine. The Bcash blockchain should freeze in its tracks.

Bcash’s Solutions
Bcash does have solutions for this problem — sort of.

First off, Bcash implemented an emergency re-adjustment scheme to deal with situations like these. If, within a time-frame of twelve hours, fewer than six blocks are found, difficulty adjusts downward by 20 percent. This can help get difficulty down to normal levels quicker.

But that’s not a perfect solution in itself. For one, it does still require at least six blocks to be found, and probably more to get difficulty back to normal. This means that miners still need to mine on the Bcash chain at a loss, against their short-term interests. Furthermore, miners that are unfriendly toward Bcash could — somewhat ironically — mine on this chain just enough to prevent such a re-adjustment.

And even if some miners do mine on the Bcash chain toward a difficulty adjustment, it would just set the exact same dynamic in motion after a while. The Bcash chain would be more profitable to mine for a couple of days, after which difficulty shoots upwards and the chain should freeze in its tracks. Then these miners would have to, once again, mine at a loss to keep the chain alive, only to set the same dynamic in motion again. And again. And again.

Interestingly, this scenario could potentially benefit miners at large, especially if they coordinate. While some miners do need to mine against their short-term interests to reach the required difficulty adjustment, once that difficulty adjustment is reached, all miners get to sweep up massive amounts of block rewards within a day or two.

As long as there are buyers for these coins, such a stop-and-go cycle could be very profitable for miners in the long term. But it is of course not very desireable for users.

Other Solution(s)
This is not a new science.

Namecoin, one of the first altcoins, faced similar problems in 2011. After a sudden jump in hash rate, its chain got stuck, and it took months for ideologically motivated miners to work toward a next difficulty adjustment at a loss. This cycle repeated a couple of times, at which point Namecoin fixed the problem by “merged mining” the coin with Bitcoin. All Bitcoin miners can now automatically mine Namecoin using the same hash power, without needing to switch between chains. Many Bitcoin miners do.

The problem that Namecoin had to face is also a key reason why Litecoin's creator, Charlie Lee, decided to implement the Scrypt mining algorithm in Litecoin, another early altcoin. He realized that a secondary cryptocurrency should not compete with Bitcoin for hash power on the SHA256 algorithm at all, exactly because of the instability that would result. By picking an entirely different algorithm, miners can’t hop from one chain to another, thus resolving the problem as well.

And many other altcoins, like Ethereum, have much faster difficulty readjustment schemes. While this may technically still require miners to mine at a loss in some cases (and could have other detrimental effects), this situation should resolve within hours or days — not weeks or months.

If Bitcoin Cash chooses to adopt any of these solutions, the coin will probably require another hard fork. 

Alternatively, of course, its block rewards will have to become more valuable than Bitcoin’s…

Thanks to Litecoin creator Charlie Lee for information and feedback.

2017/8/23,The Long Road to SegWit: How Bitcoin’s Biggest Protocol Upgrade Became Reality,"Segregated Witness (SegWit) has activated on Bitcoin. As of today, all SegWit-ready nodes on the Bitcoin network are enforcing the new rules, marking Bitcoin’s biggest protocol upgrade to date.

But activation did not come easy, and it did not come fast.

This is a look back at the long road to SegWit.



The Problem


Bitcoin transactions consist of two main parts. One part is “base transaction data.” That covers which bitcoins are being moved and where they are being moved to, as well as some other data. The second part is called the “witness.” This contains a bit of code with cryptographic signature data, which proves that the owner of a bitcoin really did want to spend the bitcoin.

It’s this signature data that brings a slight complication with it. In what is referred to as the “malleability bug,” Bitcoin signatures can be slightly altered by anyone, even after these signatures are created and without invalidating the signatures. This in turn means that the appearance of the whole transaction, and more specifically the transaction identifier, can be altered by those relaying transactions over the Bitcoin network or by miners that include transactions in blocks.

This doesn’t need to be a big problem in itself. Transactions are still valid and will move the bitcoins from the same place to the same place, under all the same conditions. However, it does complicate creating newer transactions depending on unconfirmed transactions: New transactions need to know the transaction identifier they rely on. This, in turn, makes it significantly harder to build certain second-layer protocols on top of Bitcoin, like bi-directional payment channels.



The Idea


The general idea to solve the malleability bug by “separating” signature data from other transaction data stems back several years.

As far back as 2012, the likes of Bitcoin Core contributors Russell O’Connor, Matt Corallo, Luke Dashjr and Gregory Maxwell, as well as Bitcointalk moderator “Theymos,” discussed the issue on IRC Bitcoin development channels — but at that time they didn’t see a tenable way of pulling it off on the Bitcoin network.

A year later, in August 2013, the issue resurfaced, as Bitcoin Core contributors Peter Todd and Gregory Maxwell were having similar discussions on IRC. But now, the two were making progress with their ideas to counter malleability. “I'm talking about making the [entirety] of the scriptsig largely [separate],” Maxwell wrote. “I'd even suggest using as [transaction ID] the transaction without the scriptsigs.”

Another month later, Maxwell and, this time, well-known cryptographer Dr. Adam Back were discussing the malleability issue on IRC once again. Now, Back suggested computing the transaction ID by omitting the signature. Though, Maxwell commented, “getting the sig out of the txid could help but that would be a very deep hardforking change ... and it's actually tricky to make secure.”



The Sidechain

In August 2014, blockchain technology company Blockstream was founded by the same Adam Back and Gregory Maxwell, as well as entrepreneur and investor Austin Hill and several Bitcoin Core developers, including Dr. Pieter Wuille. The company was set to focus on sidechains: alternative blockchains that can effectively be pegged to Bitcoin.

By early 2015, Blockstream engineers decided to implement a new feature in the company’s prototype sidechain Elements, which was publicly announced in June of that year. This feature would conclusively solve the malleability issue on the sidechain — by separating base transaction data from witness data into different data structures.

The name of this new feature was, of course, Segregated Witness.



The Block Size Dispute


It had been looming for some time, technically since October 2010, more concretely since February 2013 and finally publicly, bursting onto the scene by the spring of 2015: the block size limit dispute.

Former Bitcoin Core lead developer Gavin Andresen and Bitcoinj lead developer Mike Hearn, in particular, believed that Bitcoin’s 1 megabyte block size limit should be increased with a hard fork, an incompatible protocol change that would require almost the entire Bitcoin ecosystem to upgrade. No easy task — even more so because there was no community-wide consensus for this change.

Regardless, by the summer of 2015, Andresen and Hearn announced that they would move forward with their plans, using the alternative Bitcoin XT software client. The controversial nature of the effort put the Bitcoin development community and industry in somewhat of a state of emergency.

In an attempt to resolve the divide and potentially help figure out a resolution to the block size dispute, two conferences (or workshops) were quickly organized in the latter half of 2015: Scaling Bitcoin Montreal and Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong.

One of the most promising scaling proposals presented in Montreal was the lightning network, a sophisticated second-layer scaling solution that was detailed in a white paper published by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja only months earlier. The only problem: this solution would require a malleability fix. 




The Soft Fork


Eric Lombrozo (CodeShark), Wladimir van der Laan (wumpus), Luke Dashjr (luke-jr) and Dr. Pieter Wuille (sipa) discuss SegWit as a soft fork on IRC

At this point in time, developers were still not sure if and how the malleability bug could be fixed. Most still thought Segregated Witness could not be implemented on Bitcoin’s main chain without a hard fork.

But not Bitcoin Core contributor (and Bitcoin Knots maintainer) Luke Dashjr.

In October 2015, right between the two Scaling Bitcoin conferences, Bitcoin Core contributors Eric Lombrozo, Pieter Wuille, Wladimir van der Laan and Luke Dashjr discussed a potential new model for soft forks on IRC. During this chat, Dashjr pointed out that the proposed mechanism wouldn’t work for all potential soft forks, like a SegWit soft fork.

Interestingly, what Dashjr considered obvious — the option to deploy SegWit as a soft fork — had not even been considered by others at all. And even Dashjr didn’t seem to realize the implications of this possibility at first.

To deploy SegWit as a soft fork, witness data had to be placed in a new part of a Bitcoin block. And the “anchor” for all of this witness data (the “Merkle root”) had to be moved to a somewhat unconventional part of a Bitcoin block: the coinbase transaction that rewards miners new coins.

While unconventional, the Bitcoin Core contributors would, over the days and weeks that followed, also come to realize that this method opened up an interesting “bonus.” By creating a new part of a Bitcoin block for the witness data, Bitcoin’s block size could be increased in such a way that non-upgraded nodes wouldn’t notice. This could actually increase Bitcoin’s block size without increasing Bitcoin’s existing block size limit.

Mere weeks before the second Scaling Bitcoin workshop, several Bitcoin Core contributors thought they may finally have found at least a temporary solution for the block size limit dispute. Segregated Witness would effectively increase the limit in a backward-compatible manner, while at the same time fixing the long-standing malleability bug, thereby enabling more advanced scaling solutions like the lightning network.

A win-win-win solution — or so they thought.



The Presentation


Segregated Witness — as a soft fork — was first presented by Pieter Wuille in December 2015, at the second edition of the Scaling Bitcoin workshops in Hong Kong. Many first heard about the proposal there, and it initially seemed to be welcomed with enthusiasm.


Shortly after this second edition of Scaling Bitcoin had ended, Gregory Maxwell proposed what has become known as the scaling roadmap, which featured SegWit as a centerpiece. This roadmap was quickly endorsed by the Bitcoin Core development team, as well as other developers and users in the broader Bitcoin ecosystem.



The Critique


But despite initial excitement, Segregated Witness had its critics, too.

Concerns about the proposed protocol upgrade varied. Jeff Garzik, the former Bitcoin Core contributor — who would soon after found his own development company Bloq — did not consider SegWit a sufficient short-term scaling solution. Bitcoin XT lead developer Mike Hearn, meanwhile, was not convinced by the proposal at all: He dismissed the solution as an “accounting trick” and completely quit Bitcoin development shortly after. 

Jonathan Toomim, developer for alternative software client Bitcoin Classic, argued that the proposal was “ugly and awkward,” suggesting it would be better implemented as a hard fork. Even Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd had his concerns, in particular related to mining.

Most of these issues were deemed either solvable, unconvincing or worth the trade-off by the Bitcoin Core development team at large, however. Development of the soft-fork upgrade commenced.



The Development


Even though a version of Segregated Witness was already implemented on Elements, the code for the Bitcoin main chain version mostly had yet to be written, not only because it needed to be implemented as a soft fork, but also because SegWit for Bitcoin would enjoy a range of new features not present in Elements: for example, the “witness discount” necessary to increase the block size, new compatibility for the peer-to-peer network and more.

The concrete Bitcoin Improvement Proposal for SegWit, BIP141, was authored by Pieter Wuille, Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo and independent Bitcoin Core contributor Dr. Johnson Lau. By early January 2016, in the midst of a heated scaling debate, these and other Bitcoin Core contributors launched an initial dedicated test network for the protocol upgrade, which was dubbed SegNet. Another two weeks later, this testnet was taken public for the wider Bitcoin development community to experiment with. And by March, SegNet was upgraded to support test versions of the lightning network.

Development continued for the months to come, taking in feedback from Bitcoin’s development community, fixing bugs, improving the codebase accordingly and launching several more iterations of SegNet(s).

Meanwhile, Bitcoin Core contributors also reached out to the broader Bitcoin industry, which over time led to a consistently growing list of companies and projects committing to supporting Segregated Witness.

By June, the Segregated Witness code counted 4,743 lines of code (including test code) and proposed removing or modifying 554 existing lines of Bitcoin Core code. After more review from several contributors, Bitcoin Core lead maintainer, Wladimir van der Laan, merged it into Bitcoin Core’s “master branch” by the end of that month.



The Meetings


At the same time that SegWit was being developed, block size tensions in the Bitcoin community were once again heating up. This time spearheaded by Bitcoin Classic, a number of Bitcoin companies and miners appeared determined to hard fork in order to increase the block size limit to 2 megabytes.

In what is perhaps best described as an emergency meeting, once again in Hong Kong, several Bitcoin Core contributors, mining pool operators and other Bitcoin industry members met to discuss the scaling issue.

The meeting led to an agreement that came to be known as the “Bitcoin Roundtable Consensus” (or the “Hong Kong Agreement”). The Bitcoin Core contributors present at the meeting agreed to work on a block size limit increase hard fork to be proposed to the Bitcoin Core development team and the wider Bitcoin community. The miners, in turn, agreed to run a SegWit release in production by the time such a hard fork would be released in a version of Bitcoin Core. The crisis seemed to have been averted — even though it quickly became clear that not everyone was happy about the agreement.

Several months later, an even bigger group of Bitcoin Core contributors and mining pool operators met in California. The Bitcoin Core contributors present at this meeting left convinced that Segregated Witness would be activated by the miners.



The Release


About six months behind on the initial schedule — the release was originally set for April — Segregated Witness was officially introduced October of 2016, in Bitcoin Core version 0.13.1. The protocol upgrade was also implemented in several other Bitcoin implementations, like Bitcoin Knots and Bcoin.

Using an activation method called ""VersionBits"" (BIP9), designed to minimize network disruption, 95 percent of miners (by hash power) had to signal support for SegWit to activate on the Bitcoin network. This miner signaling was to start on November 15th. Meanwhile, users were encouraged to upgrade their clients, which over time, it seemed, many did.

As of August 2017, the vast majority of the Bitcoin network consists of SegWit-ready nodes

Based on the meetings with mining pool operators, as well as a general conviction that SegWit would be a boon for Bitcoin, many expected that the soft fork would be activated rather quickly.



The Politics


But that’s not what happened. As it turned out, several attendees of the Hong Kong Roundtable Consensus disagreed over what they had actually signed onto.

Bitmain co-CEO Jihan Wu, in particular, indicated he would only be willing to activate SegWit if the Bitcoin Core development team also implemented a hard fork to increase the block size limit in their codebase. Other mining pools, including F2Pool, HaoBTC and bitcoin.com didn’t signal support for the soft fork either.

Bitmain (and subsidiary AntPool) demand a hard fork block size limit increase in return for SegWit activation.

Moreover, a new Chinese mining pool emerged: ViaBTC. With close ties to Bitmain, ViaBTC alone garnered enough hash power to single-handedly block SegWit activation. And its operator, Haipo Yang, positioned himself as a staunch critic of the proposed protocol upgrade.

SegWit activation seemed far away.



The UASF


The avatar of pseudonymous Bitcoin and Litecoin developer Shaolinfry

In February 2017, a little over three months after the official release of SegWit, a new opportunity presented itself.

The pseudonymous developer “Shaolinfry,” who had previously contributed to Litecoin, dropped a new proposal in the Bitcoin development mailing list and the popular bitcointalk.org forum: a “user activated soft fork” or “UASF.”

Shaolinfry argued in his email that the hash power activation mechanism that had become the standard for soft forks was never intended to be a “vote.” “[T]he signaling methodology is widely misinterpreted to mean the hash power is voting on a proposal and it seems difficult to correct this misunderstanding in the wider community,” he wrote.

Shaolinfry proposed an alternative: a user activated soft fork (UASF). Instead of hash power activation, a user activated soft fork would have a “‘flag day activation’ where nodes begin enforcement at a predetermined time in the future.” As long as such a UASF is enforced by an economic majority, this should compel a majority of miners to follow (or activate) the soft fork.

The idea immediately generated buzz throughout Bitcoin forums and social media. And when former BTCC COO and outspoken SegWit proponent Samson Mow set up a bounty fund for the development of a UASF software implementation, it seemed like the proposal could become a reality.



The Patented Technology


In the first week of April 2017, Gregory Maxwell dropped what was widely considered a bombshell revelation on the Bitcoin development mailing list.

Maxwell claimed to have reverse-engineered a specialized ASIC-mining chip and found that it included patented AsicBoost technology. What’s more, Maxwell revealed that covert use of the technology would be incompatible with a soft-forked version of SegWit. “An incompatibility would go a long way to explain some of the more inexplicable behavior from some parties in the mining ecosystem,” he noted.

While no specific ASIC-manufacturer was mentioned in Maxwell’s email, Bitmain acknowledged that it had implemented the patented technology in their mining chips — though it denied having used it on Bitcoin’s mainnet.

Either way, for some users the revelation added to the desire to have the Segregated Witness soft fork activated on the Bitcoin network. And, as hash power activation seemed even less likely now, a user activated soft fork was increasingly looking like the solution to accomplish that.



The BIP148 Proposal


Shortly after proposing the general idea of a UASF, Shaolinfry and about a dozen other members of the Bitcoin community opened a UASF channel on the Bitcoin Core Community Slack.

The channel became a central point of discussion and organization for the initiative. A flag date was picked, initially for October 1, then later moved to August 1 to better account for potentially low hash power support. Shaolinfry authored a concrete Bitcoin Improvement Proposal: BIP148. Open Dime founder Rodolfo Novak also established an informational website to promote the idea.

The initial plan was to get exchanges and other businesses on board with the UASF. If these companies would support the proposal and enforce the soft fork, it would go a long way in realizing a desired economic majority.

But the UASF did not gain the level of traction some of its proponents hoped for. While a number of companies and some developers seemed onboard with BIP148, no major exchanges or other businesses declared support and some even spoke out against the initiative.

And, by mid-April, Gregory Maxwell on the Bitcoin development mailing list stated that he believed BIP148 to be a bad idea as well. Coming from one of the most respected and influential Bitcoin Core contributors, his rejection of the initiative had an impact: This version of a UASF appeared to be losing all momentum.

Instead, some began to work on an alternative UASF: BIP149.



The Altcoins


Many altcoins are based on Bitcoin’s codebase. This means that the SegWit code, while developed for Bitcoin, is largely compatible with these alternative cryptocurrencies. Unsurprisingly, therefore, several altcoins decided to implement SegWit. The first to activate Segregated Witness was Groestlcoin as early as January 2017.

But other coins were struggling. Litecoin, Vertcoin and Viacoin all seemed to have been caught in Bitcoin’s political game. These coins relied on the same miners as Bitcoin, to a large extent, and most were not signaling support for the upgrade.

This was allegedly due to technical issues or other stated reasons, but, as Viacoin lead developer Romano noted, “It seems more likely they want to refrain from activating Segregated Witness on altcoins because that would give them even less reason to hold off activation on Bitcoin.”

By April of 2017, this attitude led Litecoin creator Charlie Lee to advocate for a user activated soft fork on “his” coin. His initiative was eagerly picked up among Litecoin users; it didn’t take long for Litecoin miners, Lee, and other members of the Litecoin ecosystem to arrange an online meeting, the result of which was the Litecoin Global Roundtable Resolution. In exchange for some commitments by Lee, miners agreed to activate SegWit. ShaolinFry and others considered the UASF effort a success.

Within a week after SegWit activation on Litecoin, an unknown person made a bold move. He (or she) sent $1 million worth of the cryptocurrency to a SegWit-protected address, challenging anyone to steal the funds if they could. To this date, the bounty remains untouched, further strengthening confidence in the technology.



The New York Agreement


Meanwhile, the block size debate raged on. Another software client to increase Bitcoin’s block size limit per hard fork, Bitcoin Unlimited gained traction among Bitcoin’s mining community. Endorsed by Bitmain’s Wu in particular, the project appeared to be heading toward a potential (and controversial) hard fork.

This looming threat, and the possibility of a “split” in Bitcoin’s blockchain, was reason for DCG founder and CEO Barry Silbert to organize a meeting ahead of the Consensus 2017 conference in New York. Initially announced on a private email list for Bitcoin entrepreneurs and other prominent industry members, the meeting would bring together a significant chunk of the Bitcoin industry, including miners — though, notably, no Bitcoin Core contributors.

The outcome of that meeting is typically referred to as the “New York Agreement.” Participants agreed on what they deemed to be a compromise between those who wanted to increase Bitcoin’s block size with a hard fork and those who preferred SegWit. Based on an idea originally proposed by RSK founder Sergio Demian Lerner, SegWit would be activated under specific conditions, while there would also be a hard fork to double Bitcoin's “base block size limit.”

But while it sufficed to say not everyone in the Bitcoin ecosystem supported the agreement, one specific problem stood out in particular. The conditions for SegWit activation were largely incompatible with those proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team, for which the code was already widely adopted by Bitcoin users.



The Intolerant Minority

While the BIP148 UASF seemed to have lost a lot of steam in favor of BIP149, not everyone had given up on this first UASF proposal completely.

Shaolinfry had proposed the concept under the assumption that it would be backed by an economic majority and thought it should be aborted before the flag day otherwise. But a group of users on the UASF Slack channel had a different idea. Some of them — including Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Knots developer Luke Dashjr — were contemplating activating the soft fork regardless of what the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem would do. Even if they were a minority, and even if they’d effectively spin themselves off into a new altcoin, they would move forward with the upgrade.

Around mid-May, Alphonse Pace linked this determination to a game-theoretical concept described by statistician and author Nassim Nicholas Taleb: the “intolerant minority.” In short, this idea presupposes that even an economic minority should be able to compel miners to activate the Segregated Witness soft fork. They would unnecessarily lose a chunk of their “customer base” (Bitcoin users) otherwise.

Seemingly fuelled by the AsicBoost scandal, the SegWit activation on Litecoin and discontent regarding the New York Agreement — and this time backed by game theory — BIP148 support started to snowball into somewhat of a viral phenomenon on social media and message boards once again.

Several more articles discussed the growing potential of the UASF and much debate on social media, YouTube channels other discussion platforms followed. Meanwhile, Eric Lombrozo also threw his weight behind the effort, and UASF hats distributed by Samson Mow became the rage. Inspired by the codename for an upcoming Electrum Wallet release, August 1 was dubbed “Bitcoin Independence Day.”

The only problem: activation methods for BIP148 and the New York Agreement were as incompatible as the New York Agreement was with the activation methods proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team.



The Kludge


It was Bitmain Warranty engineer James Hilliard who came to the rescue. Hilliard proposed a slightly complex but clever solution that would make everything compatible: Segregated Witness activation as proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team, the BIP148 UASF and the New York Agreement activation mechanism. His BIP91 could keep Bitcoin whole — at least throughout SegWit activation.

As long as a majority of miners would activate BIP91 before August 1, all Bitcoin nodes should remain part of the same network. It was a relatively small time window, since the solution was only proposed by late May, but Jeff Garzik, the main developer attached to the New York Agreement, adopted the proposal and planned to release the software client resulting from that agreement weeks before August 1. It was doable.



The Activation

By mid-July, Bitcoin miners had missed their window to activate SegWit through the method proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team in time to be compatible with BIP148. As a result, markets seemed to get nervous about a potential “split” between a BIP148 chain and a non-BIP148 chain. In the span of only a week, bitcoin’s exchange rate tumbled from around $2500 to $1900: the lowest it had been in well over a month.

Possibly startled by these market movements, Bitcoin’s mining community started to rapidly signal support for BIP91, even ahead of the schedule set forth by the New York Agreement. And on July 20, ten days before BIP148’s August 1 flag day for activation, BIP91 locked in. It activated a little over two days later.

With BIP91 locked in, it was only a matter of time before Segregated Witness itself would lock in. This ultimately happened on August 9 — the point of no return having been reached on August 8.

Bitcoin would “officially” get SegWit after another two-week grace period.



The Adoption

The final step for Segregated Witness is, of course, actual user adoption. Since SegWit has only just activated at the time of publication of this article, it’s impossible to know how quickly and how much the upgrade will actually be used. Some critics, perhaps most notably Garzik, predict that widespread adoption could take up to a year or even longer. Others, including a number of wallet and library developers, think they can utilize the feature within weeks, or they are prepared already. And other technologies that depend on the upgrade, such as the Lightning Network, but also Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees (MAST), atomic swaps, faster transaction signing for hardware wallets, the more efficient Schnorr signature algorithm, and TumbleBit in payment processor mode, are in various stages of development as well.

It’s been a long road, but anyone who wants to use Segregated Witness should now be able to do so, starting today.",Technical,0.9992
2017/8/24,How the Blockstream Satellite Will Drive Bitcoin Adoption: An Interview with Adam Back and Chris Cook,"Last week Bitcoin Magazine covered the announcement of Blockstream Satellite, a new service that broadcasts real-time Bitcoin blockchain data from satellites in space to almost everyone on the planet. Currently Blockstream Satellite covers across two-thirds of the Earth, and service expansions are in the works.

“Today’s launch of Blockstream Satellite gives even more people on the planet the choice to participate in Bitcoin,” said Blockstream co-founder and CEO Adam Back, when the announcement was made. “With more users accessing the Bitcoin blockchain with the free broadcast from Blockstream Satellite, we expect the global reach to drive more adoption and use cases for Bitcoin, while strengthening the overall robustness of the network.”

The idea of streaming the Bitcoin blockchain to the whole planet from satellites in space had previously been proposed by Jeff Garzik, but Blockstream’s implementation introduces some interesting tweaks: It relies on existing commercial satellites already in orbit and leverages open-source software, namely GNU Radio and FIBRE, to reduce costs.

The announcement of the Blockstream Satellite has been received with considerable interest from both the blockchain and space communities, but also with doubts and lingering questions. Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Adam Back and Chris Cook, Head of Satellite at Blockstream, to find out more.

You are essentially using existing commercial satellites as relays. Why is this approach better than building, launching and operating your own satellites, now that cubesats and cheaper cubesat launch systems permit doing so cost effectively?
Chris Cook: While there have been many recent reductions in the cost of cubesats and other low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, it is still a considerably more expensive venture than using existing satellites. As cubesats are not geosynchronous, they are always moving overhead. This means that you need many of them for complete global coverage.

Additionally, many cubesats have a lifetime of only a few months before they fall out of orbit. Either you need to continuously replenish them or you have to boost them into higher orbit, both of which increase costs.

Finally, we have not entirely dismissed the idea of launching our own satellites. However, deploying a global satellite network with existing satellites seemed like a good first step. It allows us to deliver this service to people throughout the world quickly and cost effectively.

What could you do with dedicated custom satellites that you can't do with the current system?
Chris Cook: A dedicated satellite would potentially enable us to operate a node on a satellite itself rather than [have it be] supported from a ground station.  

What if political pressures force your commercial satellite service providers to cancel your contracts?
Adam Back: Because Bitcoin is already widely used and made available via other means in many countries around the world, the threat of the satellite broadcast of Bitcoin being canceled is not likely. The satellite network is providing redundant, low-cost availability for data that is already publicly available and downloadable by anyone over the internet. There are multiple satellites from different providers in the Blockstream Satellite network.

Related to that, does Blockstream Satellite (or a conceivable extension) permit improving on the privacy and anonymity of bitcoin transactions?
Adam Back: Blockstream Satellite allows passive receipt so there is basically no footprint of internet traffic allowing your ISP or monitoring companies analyzing the Bitcoin network to track your node. This may make it attractive even for users with fast home internet to use Blockstream Satellite, where they can then connect and pin their wallet to their home node via Tor.

For geographies where high-speed internet is expensive or not available, they can connect smartphone wallets over WiFi or meshnet to satellite nodes, and broadcast transactions via SMS gateways such as SMSPushTX, by Pavol Rusnak, or bi-directional Ku or L-band internet services (available commercially and unrelated to Blockstream Satellite) which can be expensive, but even the most expensive at $10/MB works out to less than one US penny per transaction, as Bitcoin transactions are small.

So, I have set up my Blockstream Satellite receiving station. I am not connected to the internet. How do I send a bitcoin payment?
Adam Back: See above via SMS, or often people do have 2.5G or 3G data but at expensive data rates. Because Bitcoin transactions are small, the cost of sending a transaction is small, even if receiving the blockchain would be expensive.

For shared equipment, perhaps for a village or business area, a bi-directional satellite internet is also cost-effective, again because of small Bitcoin transactions. L-band BGAN is mobile, and Ku band [Hughes receivers] are fixed satellite dishes.

Your FAQ says that transactions can be sent using other communication channels such as SMS. Do you operate your own SMS relays for bitcoin transactions or do you recommend using external services? If so, which ones?
Adam Back: We do not at this time operate an SMS gateway but Pavol does (see above). We are working with and encouraging Bitcoin enthusiasts and entrepreneurs to build out custom infrastructure configurations and share setup tips online.

What are some of the innovative “killer apps” that you hope Blockstream Satellite could enable?
Adam Back: We see the Blockstream Satellite service as one stepping stone to decentralizing Bitcoin by radically reducing node cost and therefore scaling the ability for people to run nodes.

The Blockstream Satellite provides many advantages for different kinds of network configurations:

No internet or expensive internet: Connect a smart phone wallet to a satellite node via WiFi or meshnet;

Partition protection: Use a satellite as a cheaper source of blocks, and cross check with other peers. In the event of an internet partition, the satellite will automatically bridge the network outage;

Privacy: Use Blockstream Satellite to receive the Bitcoin blockchain with zero or low network footprint. You can verify the satellite data via other peers, and in low bandwidth conditions, with as little data as an 80 byte SMS with the most recent blockheader;

Financial sovereignty and security: Blockstream Satellite reduces the cost of running a full node to nearly zero. By running a full node and connecting your smartphone wallet and other wallets to it, you no longer need to trust third parties: As the saying goes, “Don’t Trust. Verify!”

Decentralization: One of the most interesting properties of Bitcoin is that it is a permissionless and digital gold-like bearer asset. To ensure Bitcoin stays permissionless, it is important that many people across many countries, [including] individuals and small businesses, run full nodes. By radically reducing the cost of running a full node, we hope many more people will, guaranteeing Bitcoin’s permissionlessness and reinforcing its bearer status.

In terms of innovative applications, we intend to provide a developer API to send application data via the satellite paid in mBTC/KByte so that the developer community, startups and local entrepreneurs can bring new applications to market.

We launched phase 1 satellite coverage across two-thirds of the world’s landmass, and we have plans for worldwide coverage by the end of the year. [As] Blockstream Satellite provides complete Bitcoin coverage globally, it becomes possible to access Bitcoin from a village without high speed internet and without grid power. Or with the right equipment, you could even access Bitcoin on the move from an RV or boat with motorized dishes.",Technical,0.9984
2017/8/24,Segregated Witness Activates on Bitcoin: This is What to Expect,"The Segregated Witness (SegWit) soft fork has activated on the Bitcoin network.

As of block height 481,824, found at 1:57 UTC by BTCC, all SegWit ready nodes started enforcing the new SegWit consensus rules. As Bitcoin’s biggest protocol upgrade to date, this introduces a whole new data structure, which changes the appearance of Bitcoin blocks for upgraded nodes — while non-upgraded nodes should continue to function as normal.

More concretely, SegWit activation means that Bitcoin’s block size limit is replaced by a block “weight” limit, which allows for blocks up to 4 megabytes in size. Additionally, and perhaps more importantly, SegWit transactions won’t suffer from the “malleability bug,” which in turn enables advanced second-layer protocols like the Lightning Network, atomic swaps, MAST, and more.

Here’s what to expect for the next couple of hours, days, weeks, months and beyond…

The Block Size Limit Becomes a Block Weight Limit
Bitcoin blocks now have a weight limit instead of a size limit. Depending on the types of transactions included, this means that blocks can get up to 4 megabytes big — though some 2 megabytes is a more realistic maximum. This should decrease network fees for users, and speed up transaction confirmation times.

However, this doesn’t mean that all blocks will immediately bump to 2 megabytes in size today. For a transaction to utilize the added space, it must be sent from a SegWit address (or more accurately, a Segwit “output”) — not just to a SegWit address.

At the time of activation, of course, no bitcoins were locked up in SegWit addresses whatsoever. That wasn’t possible up till now. So at the very least, bitcoins must be spent once to a SegWit address once first. Only when they’re spent again will they benefit from the extra space.

Additionally, wallets and other applications need to be ready to accept SegWit transactions. Some wallets, like GreenAddress, may offer this option on day one, or shortly thereafter. “We had this in testnet on by default for a very long time now,” GreenAddress developer Lawrence Nahum told Bitcoin Magazine. “We’ll make it's available almost immediately after activation; we just want to make sure activation is smooth before we enable it.”

Similarly, large Bitcoin service providers could start accepting SegWit transactions right away, though some may need more time to prepare. BitGo, a Bitcoin infrastructure provider for major exchanges like Bitstamp, Kraken and OKCoin, expects to be SegWit-ready relatively soon as well.

BitGo engineer Jameson Lopp told Bitcoin Magazine:

“We’ve not set an actual date, though we certainly want to deploy it as soon as possible. I expect general availability sometime next week.”

Some other wallets and services, however, may take a little longer; how long will differ from wallet to wallet.

Lightning and More
Arguably even more highly anticipated than an increased block size, second-layer technologies like the Lightning Network and, further out, Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees (MAST), will be more easily built on top of Bitcoin, thanks to Segregated Witness.

Most of this technology is still a work in progress, and it could take several more months before regular users are expected to use it. That said, it is likely that there will be experimentation on Bitcoin’s mainnet rather soon, according to Lightning Labs CEO and cofounder, Elizabeth Stark.

“Today we released version 0.3 alpha of our Lightning Network Daemon software, which is the last major release before our mainnet beta release,” said Stark to Bitcoin Magazine. “We're not giving any exact predictions, but our goal is to get it up and running as soon as it's thoroughly tested and stable. We may also see some test mainnet transactions by developers once SegWit activates.”

And even when the Lightning Network is functional and in use, it will take a little longer to roll out more advanced features that utilize the Lightning Network or similar protocols. These include atomic swaps, which allows for the instant and (near) costless exchange of cryptocurrencies over different blockchains, like bitcoin and litecoin. And Stark said a larger development ecosystem is growing around the technology as well.

“We're seeing app development on the Lightning Network taking off, which we're very excited about. Once the mainnet releases are out, we expect there to be a bunch of apps working on the Lightning Network out of the box,” she added.

Further, more nuanced benefits of SegWit, such as faster transaction signing by hardware wallets, will be available within a matter of days. The more efficient Schnorr signature algorithm is also expected to be implemented and rolled out on Bitcoin at some point, but this will take at least several more months to be production ready — or longer.

The Risks
At this point in time, SegWit activation does still present some risks for users.

The first risk applies to all soft forks, and depends on miners actually enforcing the new rules. If some don’t, non-upgraded nodes as well as many light clients in particular could accept invalid transactions and blocks, at least until the network corrects that through a blockchain reorganization (“reorg”). In the past, soft forks caused some (minimal) network disruption, but the risks do seem limited this time around.

“I suspect that the reorg risk is relatively low for full nodes with SegWit. The only prior case like this was that validationless mining chain-split two years ago, but that didn't affect full nodes,” Blockchain consultant Peter Todd told Bitcoin Magzine. “And fortunately Bitcoin Core includes a lot of improvements to speed that older and alternative implementations don't have, so there's a good chance basically all miners are running Bitcoin Core with only small modifications to non-consensus code, if any.”

Additionally, the first couple of hours after activation do open a small window for advanced types of miner attacks, which resemble (or are) 51% attacks. If large amounts of bitcoin are sent to SegWit addresses after activation, miners could theoretically still “roll back” the blockchain to a point in time before activation to re-build it from there. Since SegWit outputs are not secure before activation, such a rollback could allow miners to steal these funds.

Like any other 51% attack, the costs to perform this attack does increase for every block that is found after activation, to the point where it becomes infeasible quite fast. That said, it is probably wise not to send huge amounts of bitcoin to SegWit addresses straight away, and instead wait at least a couple of hours or maybe days to do so.

Lastly, Todd pointed out that some (untested) services may fail shortly after SegWit activation, as they have likely only integrated SegWit support partially. “For example, remote procedure calls could request SegWit transactions, while at the same time rejecting these transactions because they didn’t expect to get them.” These kinds of issues should be easy to fix, however.

2017/8/27,Miners Are Milking Bcash’s Difficulty Adjustments (and Why This Is a Problem),"Bitcoin Cash (Bcash or BCH) has been more profitable to mine than Bitcoin (BTC) on multiple occasions over the past week or two. This is creating a new dynamic within Bitcoin’s ecosystem — one which is not really beneficial for either coin.

In Bitcoin Magazine's previous article on this topic, we explained why Bcash mining should normally not affect Bitcoin too much, aside from the incidental higher fees and slower confirmations. We also explained why this dynamic could, in the meantime, ruin Bcash, as it should freeze that blockchain in its tracks.

We also noted that Bcash has a built-in emergency solution to mitigate the risk, which could get its blockchain moving again. But this solution does assume either that some miners are choosing to act against their own short-term interest at certain times for the benefit of all miners — or that miners are coordinating for their mutual benefit, on some level.

Now, several days later, it appears that this is what’s happening. Some miners are either acting against their short-term interests for specific periods of time — or they are coordinating to trigger the emergency solution.

The good news for Bcash is that this means its blockchain is still in motion for now, at least on most days. But at the same time, the dynamic generated by the emergency solution is benefiting its miners overall, more than anyone else — and it’s even calling into question the long-term viability of Bitcoin Cash itself.

The Emergency Difficulty Adjustment
First, a brief recap of Bitcoin mining and Bcash’s built-in emergency solution.

Mining profitability is determined by the value of the block reward (newly mined coins plus transaction fees) and the “difficulty” to mine a block. If the value of the block rewards are higher and the difficulty is lower, miners make more money.

The difficulty on both Bitcoin and Bcash self-adjusts each time 2016 blocks are mined. If it takes longer than two weeks to mine these 2016 blocks, difficulty adjusts downward so it becomes easier to mine. If it takes less than two weeks, the difficulty adjusts upward so it becomes harder.

Bcash really needs its difficulty to be low enough to match the value of its block rewards in relation to Bitcoin. So, if Bcash's block reward is worth 15 percent of Bitcoin’s block reward, Bcash’s difficulty must also be 15 percent of Bitcoin’s difficulty, or lower. Otherwise, Bitcoin will be more profitable to mine, and miners will really have no reason ever to return to Bcash, leaving the Bcash blockchain frozen in its tracks.

The big problem is that, as long as Bcash’s block rewards do not exceed Bitcoin’s block rewards, this is bound to happen sooner or later. At some point, Bcash difficulty will exceed what its block reward will be worth, at which point all miners should leave.

To mitigate this problem, Bcash implemented a feature called the “emergency difficulty adjustment” (EDA). If in a space of at least twelve hours, fewer than six blocks are mined, the difficulty adjusts downwards by 20 percent for the next block. If miners coordinate or time this well, this can bring difficulty down by about 75 percent within a day.

The Problems
While triggering the EDA is preferable over a blockchain frozen in its tracks forever, it does present new problems.

Once difficulty is low enough, profit-maximizing miners are incentivized to jump on Bcash mining, producing an enormous number of blocks before difficulty adjusts within a day or two. Then, once the difficulty adjusts upward by a lot, and all these miners will switch back to Bitcoin — until some miners trigger Bcash’s EDA again, potentially after 12 hours or so, and all miners hop back on Bcash, creating a sort of stop-and-go cycle, on repeat.

In our previous article, we noted that this stop-and-go cycle is not ideal for users. But we didn’t go into specifics about what problems those would be, exactly. And there are a number of them…

First of all, this stop-and-go cycle actually causes a disturbance for Bitcoin users as well. Each time miners hop on Bcash, hash power leaves the Bitcoin network, which means that Bitcoin blocks are mined more slowly. As a result, Bitcoin’s transaction fees and confirmation times go up. And the fact that miners are intentionally gaming the system like this, suggests that the situation could drag on for a while: potentially weeks or months, and maybe even longer depending on how Bcash develops.

Meanwhile, this cycle makes Bitcoin Cash confirmation times very unreliable. On some days, transactions confirm very quickly, as blocks are found about every minute. On other days, there are (almost) no new blocks at all for at least 12 hours, and transactions take incredibly long to confirm, by comparison.

Arguably, an even bigger problem is that because of this dynamic, Bcash mining rewards — new coins — enter the system much more quickly: currently about four times faster than they are supposed to. As a result, Bcash’s inflation rate is relatively high. While Bitcoin’s current yearly inflation rate sits at about 4 percent, Bcash’s yearly inflation rate is on pace to be closer to 16 percent. This favors miners who earn these coins — at the cost of coin-holders.

What’s more, because of this same dynamic, Bcash’s next block halving will arrive much faster as well, possibly around mid 2018 instead of mid 2020. And if nothing changes, there could even be another halving by early 2019: the block reward could fall to 3.125 BCH in just a little over a year from now.

These halvings is where Bcash’s real problems could begin.

As perhaps its central value proposition compared to Bitcoin, Bcash wants to keep its transaction fees extremely low; even as low as zero. Therefore, it is not clear that fees will make up for the loss in rewards; it seems especially unlikely that these losses will be made up within a year, if ever. So unless the market price of BCH, compared to BTC, increases by a lot, and fast, the value of Bcash’s block reward could dwindle significantly.

Now, keep in mind that for miners to mine Bcash at all, its difficulty must be even lower than its block reward, compared to Bitcoin, and that if that is the case, all profit-maximizing miners are expected to pile on.

That means that all these miners will be able to mine the 2016 blocks even faster when they do all pile on Bcash. Instead of two days, it could take them even one day. Or less. Which would, of course, mean that the next block halving will be reached even faster. This would in turn means that the block rewards would be even less valuable, difficulty would needs to be even lower for miners to hop on, and miners would be able to mine the 2016 blocks even faster next time. Maybe even in half a day.

Bcash’s EDA could lead to vicious downward spiral, which would significantly decrease Bcash’s security against 51% attacks. It would also make it easier for miners hostile to Bcash to frustrate the system in other ways; for example, they could prevent emergency adjustments from kicking in. Moreover, Bcash could reach the point where its block rewards aren’t even worth the time and effort for miners to switch between chains, and Bcash freezes in its tracks, after all.

Bitcoin Cash will need to fix this problem somehow, and by now developers are indeed discussing the issue. Either that, or the coin must become more valuable than Bitcoin to mitigate the problem altogether — fast.",Technical,-0.9884
2017/9/4,Breaking Bitcoin: Paris is Set to Host a New Technical Bitcoin Conference,"A brand new technical conference is hitting the Bitcoin space this week.

Loosely inspired by the well-known Scaling Bitcoin workshops, the French Bitcoin community will host the Breaking Bitcoin conference in Paris, on September 9 and 10. The conference has an explicit focus on security and is targeted at an audience with an understanding of the technical aspects of Bitcoin.

“All of the talks and panels will have different angles that tie in to this theme,” co-organizer Elizabeth Stark told Bitcoin Magazine.

The Breaking Bitcoin conference was born out of discussions on the CryptoFR Slack, a discussion platform for the growing developer community in France. A group of volunteers, including French Bitcoin community member Pierre Lorcery, Chainsmiths managing director Kevin Loaec and Ledger CTO Nicolas Bacca, as well as California-based Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark, decided to organize the technical event.

“The idea was simple,” said Stark, who has previously been involved with organizing Scaling Bitcoin workshops. “We made a weekend out of the types of talks we see at developer meetups around the world and invited some of our favorite speakers to Paris.”

Breaking Bitcoin’s focus on Bitcoin’s security is unique in the space. Where Scaling Bitcoin mostly focuses on how to improve the technology in a number of ways, including scalability, fungibility, privacy, and more, Breaking Bitcoin instead highlights all the different ways in which Bitcoin can be attacked and how these attacks can be defended against.

“Talks will range from social and political attack vectors, to spam attacks, to layer 2 security, to hardware attacks, to secure and usable applications,” Stark said. “This is, as far as I know, the first ever technical conference focused solely on Bitcoin security. The goal of the event is to have a true community-driven, cypherpunk conference, and our hope is that we've delivered on this.”

Speakers and panelists in Paris include Bitcoin Core contributors Eric Lombrozo and Peter Todd, Libbitcoin developers Amir Taaki and Eric Voskuil, Lightning Network developers Dr. Christian Decker and Laolu Osuntokun, BitGo engineer Jameson Lopp, Electrum developer Thomas Voegtlin, Venture Capitalist Alyse Killeen, and many more.

2017/9/12,NO2X: Breaking Bitcoin Shows No Love for the SegWit2x Hard Fork in Paris,"“There’s no such thing as a safe hard fork,” Electrum lead developer Thomas Voegtlin corrected an audience member at the Breaking Bitcoin conference in Paris last weekend. “I would recommend to have replay protection, of course,” he added.

Community support for SegWit2x, the Bitcoin scaling proposal spearheaded by Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group, was virtually absent in Paris. Whenever the “2x” part of the New York Agreement was discussed in the French capital, speakers and visitors overwhelmingly considered it a risk to defend against — not a proposal to help succeed.

Electrum users, for example, will not blindly follow hash power in case of a chain-split, Voegtlin explained throughout his talk; instead, they’ll be able to choose which side of such a split they want to be on. And importantly, the lightweight wallet will implement security measures to prevent users from accidentally spending funds on both chains: “replay protection” that seems unlikely to be implemented on a protocol level if SegWit2x does fork off.

“We are ready,” Voegtlin said. “If [SegWit2x] doesn’t include replay protection, the fork detection we have in Electrum will be useful.”

Breaking Bitcoin
Inspired by the successful Scaling Bitcoin conference format, the French Bitcoin community hosted the first edition of Breaking Bitcoin two blocks from the Eiffel Tower last weekend. Bitcoin developers, academics and other technical-minded Bitcoiners gathered for a diverse program, but with the common denominator being Bitcoin’s security.

“For the past two years, the Bitcoin community has been obsessing with scale and scalability,” Kevin Loaec, managing director at Chainsmiths and co-organizer of the event, told Bitcoin Magazine. “But I’m not so worried about scale, I’m worried about mining centralization, a lack of privacy and fungibility ... these kinds of things. As an industry we need to recognize there are more challenges than just scalability; hopefully this conference reflects that.”

Whereas the first Scaling Bitcoin conference two years ago was a very specific reaction to a looming block size limit increase hard fork — then put forth by Bitcoin XT — this wasn’t necessarily the motivation behind Breaking Bitcoin. Yet, once again, a controversial hard fork is looming on the horizon. This time imbedded in the BTC1 implementation developed by Bloq co-founder Jeff Garzik, the New York Agreement’s SegWit2x is scheduled to increase Bitcoin’s “base block size limit” to two megabytes by November — an incompatible protocol change that could split the Bitcoin network in two.

And it did not take much to recognize how unpopular the proposal was in Paris. Perhaps most vividly, Italian Bitcoin startup ChainSide led a protest campaign by distributing NO2X stickers; the Twitter hashtag was proudly added as a piece of flair to the by now well-known Make Bitcoin Great Again and UASF hats. And voices critical of the project — like Voegtlin and his call for replay protection — could consistently count on rounds of applause. From a technical perspective, the proposal is often considered — quite frankly — to be reckless.

“Unfortunately, SegWit2x […] was designed to effectively be as disruptive to the minority chain,” MyRig engineer and BIP91 author James Hilliard said on stage during the miner panel.

SegWit2x: The Arguments
Arguments against the 2x hard fork are diverse.

Perhaps its biggest problem, SegWit2x currently lacks basic safety measures to prevent unsuspecting users from losing funds. This includes, most importantly, the aforementioned replay protection, but a new address format would be similarly helpful.

Additionally, the three-month lead time for this specific hard fork is considered extremely short — assuming the goal is to prevent a chain-split in the first place. “If you ask any of the developers, they will typically want to see 18 months or two years lead time, for something with as wide an impact on all the software and hardware out there as a hard fork,” Blockstream co-founder and Hashcash inventor Dr. Adam Back noted during a Q&A session.

And if the chain does split into different networks and currencies — one following the current Bitcoin protocol and one adopting the hard fork — the question becomes which of the two gets to use the name “Bitcoin.” So far, proponents of the SegWit2x hard fork have shown no willingness to pick a new name.

This branding issue, Bitcoin Core contributor and Ciphrex co-founder Eric Lombrozo pointed out, provides yet another point of controversy.

“My personal opinion is that whomever is proposing the change, the onus is on them to demonstrate widespread support,” Lombrozo said during his talk on protocol changes. “The people that want to keep status quo don’t need to show anything. It’s the people who want to change the stuff that actually need to demonstrate there is widespread support.”

And for now, not everyone is convinced that SegWit2x does indeed have this level of support — or anything close to it. While several large mining pools, as well as a significant number of companies, have signed on to the New York Agreement, this agreement was itself drafted without any feedback from Bitcoin’s technical community nor — even more important — a reliable gauge of user sentiment.

And while some Bitcoin companies claim to represent their customers, this is — once again — not taken for granted by everyone.

“One debate I want to draw attention to,” venture capitalist Alyse Killeen pointed out, “is the debate whether businesses speak for their users. I think this is probably a debate you would only see now in this space because it’s pretty well established that businesses outside of this space do not speak for users, but it’s a debate we still have in our community. Of course they don’t.”

NO2X
If Breaking Bitcoin in Paris can be considered at all representative of SegWit2x’s community support — which, it should be noted, is not necessarily the case — the proposal will face an uphill battle to be widely accepted in November.

Indeed, some signatories of the agreement are not so sure about the hard fork anymore: Bitwala and F2Pool have publicly backed out of the agreement. And, during a mining panel in Paris, Bitfury CIO Alex Petrov ever so slightly opened the door to potentially withdrawing support as well, if both the original and the 2x chain manage to survive.

In fact, it’s not just that contentious hard forks are considered a threat to be defended against by Bitcoin’s technical community. It goes beyond that.

In the words of Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song, at the conclusion of his opening talk of the event:

“What doesn’t kill Bitcoin makes it stronger. And conferences like this prove that we’re getting better at this. We’re getting immunized to all these hard forks, and it’s creating a better Bitcoin as a result, and that’s a very good thing. We’re securing against a lot of these attacks, and figuring out ways to mitigate these threats.”",Technical,0.3818
2017/9/14,Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 Is Released: Here’s What’s New,"Today marks the official release of Bitcoin Core 0.15.0, the fifteenth generation of Bitcoin’s original software client launched by Satoshi Nakamoto almost nine years ago. Overseen by Bitcoin Core lead maintainer Wladimir van der Laan, this latest major release was developed by nearly 100 contributors over a six-month period, with major contributions through Chaincode Labs, Blockstream and MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.

Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 offers significant performance and usability improvements over previous versions of the software implementation. It also introduces several new features to better deal with the current status of the network.

These are some of the more notable changes.

Chainstate Database Restructure
One of the biggest changes compared to previous versions of the software involves how the state of Bitcoin’s blockchain is stored. This “chainstate” or “UTXO-set” is saved in a dedicated database, whereas previously it had been categorized per transaction. If one transaction sent bitcoins to several outputs (“addresses”), these different outputs were stored as a single database entry, referring to that one transaction.

With Bitcoin Core 0.15.0, these outputs are instead stored in a single database entry each. If a single transaction sends bitcoins to different outputs, every output is stored separately. While this method does claim more disc space, it requires less computational resources if one of these outputs is spent later on.

The most concrete benefit of this new data structure is that initial sync-time for new nodes is decreased by about 40 percent. It also introduces simpler code, reduces memory usage  and more. Additionally, it fixes a bug that could theoretically crash Bitcoin Core nodes, controversially revealed at last weekend’s Breaking Bitcoin conference in Paris.

Improved Fee Estimation
As Bitcoin blocks have been filling up over the last year or two, not all transactions fit in the first block that is mined. Instead, miners typically prioritize the transactions that include the most fees. If a user wants to have his transaction confirmed quickly, he should include a high enough fee. If he’s not in a rush, a lower fee should suffice.

However, the Bitcoin network deals with inherent unpredictability in terms of the speed at which blocks are found or the number of transactions that is being transmitted at any time. This makes it hard to include the right transaction fee.

Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 lowers this fee uncertainty: The newest version of the software includes significantly better fee estimation algorithms. This is mostly because the software takes more data into account when making the estimations, such as the fees included in older confirmed transactions, as well as fees in unconfirmed transactions — the fees that proved insufficient.

Additionally, users can enjoy more flexibility. For one, Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 for the first time allows users to include fees that could take their transactions up to a week to confirm. And, also newly introduced, users can choose to accept more or less risk that their transaction could be delayed due to a sudden influx of transactions.

Replace-by-fee in User Interface
Even with improved fee estimation, it is possible that users will still need to wait longer than they want for their transactions to confirm, perhaps because there is a sudden rush of transactions on the network, or maybe because a user changed his mind and prefers to have a transaction confirm faster than originally paid for, or for other reasons.

For these cases, some wallets let users add a “replace-by-fee” tag to their transactions. With such a tag, nodes and miners on the network know that the sender may want to replace that transaction with a newer transaction that includes a higher fee. This effectively allows users to bump the transaction in line to have it confirmed faster.

Bitcoin Core nodes have supported replace-by-fee for well over a year now: They already replace “replace-by-fee” tagged transactions if the new transaction includes more fees. But it was never easy to utilize for Bitcoin Core wallet users themselves.

Until now.

The Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 wallet introduces a replace-by-fee toggle in its user interface. This lets users include the appropriate tag, allowing them to easily increase the fees on their transactions later on.

Multi-wallet Support (Client and RPC Only)
Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 lets users create several wallets for the first time. These wallets all have their own separate Bitcoin addresses, private keys and, therefore, funds. Users can utilize the different wallets for different purposes; for example, one wallet can be used for personal day-to-day purchases, another for business-related transactions, and a third just for trading.

Using several wallets can offer a number of benefits. For instance, it makes accounting easier and more convenient. Additionally, users can more easily benefit from increased privacy as the different wallets cannot be linked to each other by blockchain analysis. It’s also possible to use different wallets for specific applications and more.

For now, multi-wallet support is not yet available for regular wallet users; only advanced users who operate from the command line or through connected applications can utilize the feature.

Other Improvements
Apart from the above mentioned notable changes, Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 includes a number of additional performance improvements, as most new major Bitcoin Core releases do. Concretely, these changes speed up how quickly blocks are downloaded from the network, they let nodes start up faster, and up-to-date nodes will be able to validate new blocks more quickly, in turn benefiting network-propagation time.

Finally, it’s worth mentioning that Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 will disconnect from BTC1 peers on the network. This means that the Bitcoin network will experience less disruption if the SegWit2x hard fork splits the network, as both types of nodes will more easily find compatible peers. While this change has gotten some media attention, this change shouldn’t really be noticeable.

2017/9/20,Decred Adds Atomic Swap Support for Exchange-Free Cryptocurrency Trading,"Decred is announcing support for on-chain atomic swaps, which will allow cryptocurrency holders to trade directly, without having to rely on external exchanges. The cryptocurrencies initially supported are Decred (DCR), Bitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin (LTC).

“Support for on-chain atomic swaps is extremely useful,”Jake Yocom-Piatt, Decred Project Lead said in a statement. “Thanks to the foresight of the Lightning Network authors and developers, and the dedication of our own developers, it is our pleasure to deliver an important capability that has been discussed since the concept of cross-chain atomic transfers was proposed in 2013.”

Users can already begin performing exchanges between DCR, BTC and LTC using tools that the Decred developers have created. The tools are text-based at the moment, but will be integrated into the Decrediton GUI wallet in a future release.

According to the Decred team, this advancement disintermediates the exchange process, allowing for greater market fluency. It also delivers on the market desire for improved interoperability between currencies and the demand for new efficiencies that drive investor value.

""This is the first step in a progression toward high-utility, non-Turing complete smart contracts,” Yocom-Piatt told Bitcoin Magazine. “We look forward to a new generation of greater fluency between projects. It was a pleasure collaborating with the dev teams at Litecoin and Lighting Labs.""

The concept of atomic swaps (or atomic cross-chain trading) were first described by Tier Nolan back in 2013. A previous Bitcoin Magazine article provides a step-by-step explanation of a simple example where two users agree to swap agreed amounts of BTC and LTC and use the multisig and time lock features available in both Bitcoin and Litecoin basic scripting to synchronize two transactions on two independent blockchains without having to trust each other.

It’s worth noting that Lightning Network payment channels, now enabled by SegWit, make atomic swaps more powerful and easier to implement, and permit adding support for off-chain swaps.

“The addition of LN support allows for both on-chain and off-chain atomic swaps, meaning that trustless cross chain exchanges can occur,” noted Yocom-Piatt. “Since supporting LN does not break any existing functionality and only adds to Decred’s capabilities as a system of value storage and transmission, it is a very attractive target for addition to Decred.”

“On-chain atomic swaps are an important step towards enabling peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading,” said Laolu Osuntokun, Lightning Network Daemon (LND) lead developer. “We are excited for this process to continue with off-chain atomic swaps over the Lightning Network in the near future. By taking this process off-chain, substantial latency and privacy improvements can occur.”

Decred (DCR) describes itself as “digital currency for the people,” completely independent, community funded and community owned. The project wants to build an open and progressive cryptocurrency with a system of community-based governance integrated into its blockchain,  including a hybrid consensus system to ensure that no group can control the flow of transactions or make changes to the currency without the input of the community.

“Decred is Bitcoin as it should have been,” noted crypto-investor Jon Creasy. “Bitcoin would be of the people, for the people. As great an idea as this was, however, Bitcoin soon became controlled by an ‘oligarchy,’ so to speak.”

It’s important to note that some countries, such as China, are attacking cryptocurrency exchanges as the weakest links in the crypto ecosystem. The Decred move shows that, at least for crypto-to-crypto trading (for example, exchanging bitcoin for litecoin), it’s perfectly possible to operate without exchanges. However, it doesn’t solve the problem of crypto-to-fiat and fiat-to-crypto trading, which is arguably of top concern for cryptocurrency users.",Technical,0.4019
2017/10/6,2x or NO2X: Why Some Want to Hard Fork Bitcoin — and Why Others Do Not,"A group of Bitcoin companies plans to deploy a hard fork to double Bitcoin’s block weight limit to eight megabytes this November. Known as “SegWit2x,” this incompatible protocol change follows from the New York Agreement (NYA) and is embedded in the BTC1 software client.

SegWit2x is highly controversial. Most of Bitcoin’s development community, a number of other companies, some mining pools and — if public polls and futures markets are representative — a majority of users and the market are not on board with this hard fork. Some of them are even engaged in a sort of protest movement, under the banner “NO2X.”

For those who have not kept up with the debate, here’s an overview of the main arguments for and against the 2x hard fork part of SegWit2x.

Author’s note: Of course, not all proponents of SegWit2x agree with all of the arguments in favor of the hard fork, and not all opponents agree with all of the arguments against it. This is just a general (and probably incomplete) overview of the various arguments out there.

2X
YES to lower transaction fees and/or faster confirmations
Many proponents of a block size limit increase believe that one of Bitcoin’s main value propositions is its potential as a payment rail. They prefer on-chain transactions to be cheaper and faster than they have been recently, and think this is what the silent majority of users wants as well. SegWit2x proponents are often also a bit more willing to risk Bitcoin’s other defining features, such as censorship resistance.

With bigger Bitcoin blocks, the network can handle more transactions. This should drive average fees down and have transactions confirm faster. Or it should at least make it more expensive for attackers to spam the network with bogus transactions, if they do try to drive fees and confirmation times up. SegWit2x proponents therefore think that a hard fork to double Bitcoin’s block weight limit will onboard more users more quickly.

Faster adoption could, in turn, benefit Bitcoin in several ways. Bitcoin’s exchange rate could increase, which would also grow miner revenue, which should translate to more hash power to secure the network. Meanwhile, more total users may run full nodes to benefit geographic network decentralization. Furthermore, increased popularity might even make it harder for governments to ban Bitcoin.

YES to compromising
The New York Agreement was born in the heat of Bitcoin’s scaling debate under the looming threat of a contentious hard fork led by the alternative protocol implementation Bitcoin Unlimited. This effort was, to a large extent, spearheaded by proponents of a block size limit increase and opponents of the Segregated Witness (SegWit) protocol upgrade, like Bitmain and Bitcoin.com.

These companies leveraged hash power from their mining pools to delay SegWit activation, while planning to increase the block size limit with a hard fork. This could have “split” the Bitcoin network into two incompatible blockchains and currencies.

SegWit2x was presented as a middle-of-the-road compromise between the two warring camps of the scaling debate. “One side” would get SegWit, while the “other side” would get a capacity increase hard fork. Most signatories believed, at least at the time of the agreement, that this would be a solution that should keep the Bitcoin network together.

YES to keeping their word
While doubling Bitcoin’s block size would (probably) decrease average fees and/or confirmation times, the recent activation of SegWit did already decrease both quite a bit. What may, therefore, be more important for remaining signatories of the NYA is not so much the block weight increase but rather the agreement in and of itself. Dropping out of the agreement “halfway” — after SegWit activation but before the hard fork — would be a breach of the agreement they signed on to.

Not only that, but dropping out now could also be seen as an admission that SegWit was actually not so much activated because of the NYA in the first place — but rather because of the BIP 148 user-activated soft fork (UASF). Due to BIP 148’s controversial nature, not in the least among some of the NYA signatories, many may be eager to avoid the perception that this UASF was a success.

YES to “firing” Bitcoin Core
Currently, most people running full nodes choose to use a Bitcoin Core software client, making this the dominant implementation on the Bitcoin network. Some even consider it Bitcoin’s protocol-defining “reference client.”

SegWit2x appears to be at least partially motivated by the desire to remove the perceived power or influence that Bitcoin Core contributors have over Bitcoin’s protocol development, by having a majority of companies and miners switch to the BTC1 software client instead. (It should be noted that within this context, “firing” actually means “no longer using software maintained by these developers.” Bitcoin Core contributors are essentially volunteers and cannot literally be fired, while most of the code in the BTC1 client is forked from Bitcon Core and thus written by Bitcoin Core developers anyway.)

Bitcoin Core contributors could, of course, release a new Bitcoin Core client that adopts the SegWit2x hard fork to make it compatible with BTC1, and therefore compatible with these companies and miners. In fact, this might even be what many NYA signatories are hoping for. In that case BTC1 would effectively become Bitcoin’s new reference client, at least from the perspective of some of these signatories.

Other signatories may prefer the Bitcoin Core development team to quit altogether. In some cases, support for the hard fork may even be largely driven by resentment toward the Bitcoin Core project and a desire to take any action perceived to discredit it.

YES to miners being the deciding factor
Over 90 percent of miners (by hash power) are currently signaling support for SegWit2x. While this signaling itself is technically meaningless, SegWit2x proponents assume that miners will follow through on this stated intent.

Some SegWit2x proponents argue that miners decide the future of the Bitcoin protocol — or that miners should decide. If a hard fork were to result in two incompatible blockchains, they believe that whichever blockchain has more hash power dedicated to it is the “real” Bitcoin. Or, at least, they’ll maintain that the blockchain with the most hash power dedicated to it will be the more secure and functional “Bitcoin,” and thus the “Bitcoin” that people will want to use.

NO2X
NO to more security tradeoffs
SegWit2x opponents generally agree that increasing Bitcoin’s block size comes with a number of tradeoffs.

For one, bigger blocks increase resource requirements for operating a full node, such as more bandwidth use, longer sync time for new nodes and more. This increases the cost for individual users to partake in the network in a trustless and therefore optimally secure manner. This increased cost could, in turn, have a centralizing effect on the network, especially if it results in fewer users running full nodes.

Additionally, bigger blocks would slow down block propagation over the peer-to-peer network, which potentially benefits larger miners and mining pools: another centralizing effect.

And it may actually be good to limit network throughput to some extent, as this increases fee pressure, which in turn provides an incentive for miners to secure the network as block rewards dwindle over time.

All these types of risks can ultimately lead to a more centralized and therefore less censorship-resistant and less permissionless Bitcoin. This is sometimes referred to as the “PayPal 2.0 risk,” where Bitcoin degrades to lose what SegWit2x opponents consider to be its defining features and main value propositions.

With the activation of Segregated Witness, Bitcoin allows for a worst case of four-megabyte blocks, increased from one megabyte. Some consider this to be a somewhat risky compromise already. SegWit2x would double this risk to a worst-case total of eight megabytes, which SegWit2x opponents generally consider too big for now.

NO to “backroom deals”
While the details are a bit unclear (and that is part of the problem), SegWit2x was forged between a relatively small group of (mostly) executives from prominent Bitcoin companies during an invite-only meeting in a hotel in New York, organized by the Digital Currency Group.

After agreeing on what they considered to be a compromise between the two sides of the scaling debate, they reached out to other companies to sign on to the agreement. The aggregate customer base of all these signatories is claimed to be represented by the agreement, as is all hash power connected to participating mining pools.

Further, while BTC1 technically has an open development mailing list and a open Slack discussion channel (though both were initially closed), not much discussion is taking place in either of these venues. This either means that not much development discussion is taking place at all — or that these discussions are taking place within an unknown closed environment, too.

All this is in stark contrast with the open-source ethos in which Bitcoin was born and which still permeates Bitcoin’s development process today. Bitcoin Core contributors, for example, meet and discuss publicly on IRC, while potential protocol changes (BIPs) are discussed on a public mailing list; both communication channels are relatively active.

Moreover, SegWit2x opponents typically consider it a key feature of Bitcoin that users are in control of their own money. While companies may provide services, SegWit2x opponents don’t think these companies should get to decide what defines Bitcoin on behalf of their customers and should definitely not make them on behalf of all Bitcoin users.

All this is not just a matter of principle: opponents believe SegWit2x could actually set a bad precedent. If a small group of companies is shown to be effectively in control of the Bitcoin protocol, these companies could become a sort of central point of failure. Governments could, for example, exert pressure on them to introduce black lists or other infringements on (what they consider to be) Bitcoin’s core features.

NO to “firing” Bitcoin Core
While Bitcoin Core is indeed the dominant client on the Bitcoin network, this is only because users voluntarily choose to run this software — and many SegWit2x opponents, at least, are happy to do so. They have no desire to “fire” the Bitcoin Core development team at all.

It’s also not clear if any group of developers can or will take the place of Bitcoin Core’s current contributors should they be “fired.” Not many people in the world have as deep an understanding of Bitcoin’s codebase or inner workings as they do.

BTC1, for example, really has only one developer doing most of the work on it: Bloq CEO Jeff Garzik. Garzik does have experience working on the Bitcoin Core codebase, but his core experience is not in working on consensus-critical code. This also means that testing and review of BTC1 is rather minimal.

And while some SegWit2x proponents hope and believe that Bitcoin Core developers will merge the SegWit2x code or otherwise shift their efforts to the SegWit2x version of Bitcoin after the hard fork, this seems very unlikely: the project went so far as to issue a rare joint statement rejecting SegWit2x. Instead, if the SegWit2x hard fork were to succeed and the current Bitcoin protocol were to stop functioning, several Bitcoin Core developers have indicated they’d consider that outcome to represent a failure of Bitcoin itself and would choose to move on to different projects altogether.

Lastly, it should be noted that — while dominant — Bitcoin Core is not the only software client that embeds the current Bitcoin protocol. Bitcoin Knots, Libbitcoin, Bcoin and a range of other alternative implementations do so as well. SegWit2x would arguably be “firing” not just Bitcoin Core but most of the entire development community.

NO to contentious hard forks
Since not everyone agrees that the SegWit2x hard fork is the best way forward, or even beneficial at all, it is contentious. And many SegWit2x critics oppose any contentious hard fork for two main reasons.

The first reason is philosophical. SegWit2x opponents think that Bitcoin’s gold-like resistance to change is one of its key value propositions. More specifically, they maintain that the rules of the system should not be changed against a user’s will: that would undermine trust in this type of money.

The second reason is similar, but more technical: not only shouldn’t the rules be changed against a user’s will, the rules cannot be changed against a user’s will. As long as users run full nodes and do not switch to SegWit2x, the original Bitcoin protocol will continue to exist. As such, a hard fork like SegWit2x won’t actually change the existing Bitcoin at all; rather, it would create a new blockchain and a new currency — a coin-split.

This also explains why SegWit2x is not considered a “compromise” by opponents. For them, the SegWit2x hard fork is not a middle-in-the-middle compromise. Instead, such a contentious hard fork is precisely the thing they do not want.

NO to rushed hard forks
Even if the hard fork was not contentious, SegWit2x opponents would consider it rushed. Since everyone needs to upgrade for a hard fork to be successful — that is, there is no resulting coin-split — many think that typical hard forks should require a year of lead time at the very least, and maybe even two years or longer.

SegWit2x had a lead time of three months since SegWit activation and about six months since the agreement was made. Opponents consider this recklessly short even for popular hard forks — never mind contentious ones.

NO to a lack of replay protection
If SegWit2x does lead to a coin-split — and the current lack of consensus suggests that it will — there would be two blockchains and coins with a shared history: one coin that follows the current Bitcoin protocol and one coin that follows the SegWit2x protocol. Anyone who owns bitcoins at the time of the fork will then own both of these coins.

But this could also mean that most transactions will be equally valid on both blockchains. Whenever anyone wants to send coins on one chain, this exact same transaction could be “replayed” on the other chain, meaning both types of coins are actually spent on both chains, even if it was unintentional. This is known as a “replay attack” and can easily lead to a loss of funds.

These replay attacks can be prevented if BTC1 implements “replay protection.” But as it currently stands, the BTC1 team has no intention of implementing such protection; at least, not in such a way that would properly solve the problem.

This lack of relay protection is considered disruptive and even reckless, not only by the opponents of the hard fork but also by several signatories of the NYA: some have already dropped out for this specific reason.

For more on replay protection, see this article.

NO to brand confusion
Aside from replay protection, another big problem in the case of a coin-split could be brand confusion between the two types of coins.

If users (and service providers) on both sides of the split consider their coin to be the “real” Bitcoin, it’s not hard to imagine how this could lead to all sorts of complications. Users could, for example, buy one type of coin from an exchange even though they meant to buy another. Or they could send one type of coin to a merchant while they should have sent another. And so forth.

Such confusion could easily lead to a loss of funds, and perhaps even lawsuits and similar problems. (Even with Bitcoin Cash — which did pick a somewhat new name and added replay protection but not a new address format — there are many cases of confused users sending bitcoins to Bitcoin Cash addresses and the other way round.)

Opponents of SegWit2x maintain that it’s the coin that results from this hard fork — the coin that follows a new protocol — that should pick a new name. But so far, NYA signatories have shown no willingness to do so.

NO to keeping a broken agreement
While the intent of the NYA was to keep the Bitcoin network together, SegWit2x opponents consider this agreement to have essentially been broken since.

Segregated Witness did activate on the Bitcoin network, probably in part thanks to SegWit2x, but also instigated by the BIP 148 UASF. However, some proponents of a block size limit increase hard fork (and opponents of SegWit) also launched Bitcoin Cash in response. This realized a “split” between the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash blockchain and currency, not unlike the split Bitcoin Unlimited could have effectuated. Several NYA signatories — including Bitmain and Bitcoin.com — now support this fork, which SegWit2x opponents contend would nullify the original SegWit2x goal.

On top of that, several other signatories have since formally withdrawn their support, either because of the aforementioned lack of replay protection or for other reasons.

SegWit2x opponents therefore argue that the agreement, for all intents and purposes, has been broken and that there is no reason for the remaining signatories to keep to it.

NO to miners being the deciding factor
And finally, SegWit2x opponents believe that its proponents misunderstand how Bitcoin consensus and incentives work.

Instead of setting the protocol rules, SegWit2x opponents maintain that miners need to follow the protocol rules, as enforced by users and their full-node clients. If miners mined blocks that are incompatible with the Bitcoin protocol as defined by users, these miners would not really be mining Bitcoin at all. Instead, the “blocks” they’d produce would simply be rejected by the network of users, and these miners would be mining a different coin at best or wasting their hash power at worst.

And again, this is not just a matter of principle. If miners were to decide which protocol is valid simply by dedicating hash power to it, it would imply that they can change any protocol rules. This would even let them change the inflation schedule to remove the 21 million coin limit, steal funds and more.


Indeed, it’s no coincidence that the NO2X protest movement has much overlap with the BIP 148 UASF initiative: both maintain that users are in charge. Users decide which coin they want to buy, accept for payment and/or hold. As such, users decide which protocol is (more) valuable to dedicate hash power to: the original Bitcoin protocol or the SegWit2x protocol. This is the protocol that miners will want to mine; not the other way round.",Technical,-0.0258
2017/10/9,"Interview: Cryptographer Silvio Micali on Bitcoin, Ethereum and Proof of Stake","Interview: Cryptographer Silvio Micali on Bitcoin, Ethereum and Proof of Stake

         Interview: Cryptographer Silvio Micali on Bitcoin, Ethereum and Proof of Stake
        
Silvio Micali is an MIT professor and Turing Award–winning cryptographer known for his work in technologies that form the bedrock of blockchains today: public-key cryptosystems, digital signatures, pseudorandomness and multiparty computations. He is also the co-inventor of the zero-knowledge proof.

In the ’90s, he worked on Byzantine agreement, a protocol for getting nodes in a distributed system to agree on a state change. And in 2012, he and long-time collaborator Shafi Goldwasser were co-recipients of the A.M. Turing Award, essentially, the “Nobel Prize in computing.”

Upon learning about Bitcoin three years ago, Micali turned his attention from mechanism design, which had consumed him for the previous seven years, and dove headlong into creating a proof-of-stake algorithm. His project is called Algorand.

Put simply, Algorand relies on a novel form of Byzantine agreement with only nine expected steps. In each step, committee members, chosen at random in a private lottery, are replaced. The result is a high-security system with a negligible risk of forks.

According to Micali, recent tests show Algorand can process 2 MB blocks in 17 seconds, compared to Bitcoin, which produces a 1 MB block every 10 minutes. (A paper on these results will be presented at SOSP, the biennial ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, later this month.)

In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Micali explained why he thinks proof of stake is superior to proof of work, the consensus algorithm that underlies most cryptocurrencies today, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. Although Ethereum, more often viewed as a smart contract platform, aims to transition to proof of stake next year.

Unnecessary Evil
Micali thinks proof of work was a great idea when it first came out, but now that we have seen the consequences, he calls it an “unnecessary evil” for several reasons.

“The first time I heard about Bitcoin, I saw all the difficulties. To me, the main difficulty is the waste of computational resources. That is really appalling,” he said. “It drives up prices and depletes the planet of resources.”

Second, he sees miners as “a new center of power” and an orthogonal force to the real users of the system: the coin holders.

“If five mining pools can control what goes in or does not go in a block, in what sense is the ledger decentralized? You don’t want miners having control over the ledger, particularly when they have low margins, are far away and accountable to no one. I think it is a recipe for disaster,” he said.

Finally, transaction ambiguity does not sit well with him. In Bitcoin, occasionally two blocks are found at roughly the same time, creating a temporary fork in the chain. When that happens, the branch with the greater hash power is elongated, while the other and its blocks “disappear.” If your transactions happened to be in an orphaned block, it will eventually get picked up again in the main chain, but for Micali, the idea is unsettling.

“Every time I see my transaction is in a block, I worry the block may disappear. But never mind anxious people like me; banks may not be willing to take on the additional risk,” he said. “Can you imagine a financial world where wire transfers could be taken back?”  

Natural Democracy
Micali thinks proof of stake is a better option. In proof of stake, there are no miners, just the coin holders. Further, a coin holder’s ability to create or validate a block is based on how many coins in the system he or she owns.

“This is a natural interpretation of democracy,” Micali said. “Your influence in maintaining the integrity of the system is based on how much you are really invested in the system.”  

But there is a catch: creating a proof-of-stake algorithm is hard to do. While several projects claim to have come up with a secure protocol, Micali thinks some of those claims are questionable. “The fact is, people can claim anything they want,” he said.

One of the biggest challenges in proof of stake is the “nothing at stake” problem. If the chain forks, the optimal strategy for any coin holder is to extend both chains to earn additional block rewards or to double spend. That goes against the central design goal of all blockchains: getting users to converge on a single chain.

Some projects are looking at ways to sculpt their proof-of-stake protocols by adding perks or punishments to get coin holders to abide by the rules. As part of that, some proof-of-stake systems require users to put up a type of security deposit or bond.

Micali feels a well-designed proof-of-stake cryptocurrency should stand on its own, however, without extra measures. He thinks bonding opens doors to bad actors.

“Let me ask you, what fraction of your disposable income can you put on the table and not touch?” he said and suggested that honest people will put up only a small amount, ceding control to bad actors with big pockets.

“The danger is that only bad people will give up control over a large amount of money to manipulate the system. And if they earn much more money by misbehaving, they will be happy to lose what they put on the table,” he said.

He also disagrees with the idea of using punishment to get users to fall in line.

“A weak state rules through threats and fear,” he said, comparing the practice to barbaric punishments used by some nations to fight crime. Why do they do it? Because criminals are so rarely caught, he said. “So once they catch one, they disembowel the poor guy.”

He continued, “Do you want to oust somebody who misbehaves? Of course. But a well organized system is one in which you don’t need to punish people.”

Bitcoin and Ethereum
Most people view Bitcoin solely as a cryptocurrency, but Micali thinks the greatest value of Bitcoin and Ethereum are as enablers of smart contracts, in which users can stipulate if-then conditions around payments.  

“At the end of the day, doing only payments is easy,” he said, adding that he did not want to trivialize the problem. “Of course, decentralized payments are better than centralized payments, but what really differentiates a cryptocurrency from any other form of money is that you can actually do a smart contract.”

Based on that, he thinks that both Bitcoin and Ethereum would benefit from implementing the best consensus algorithm available. Currently, both systems are “huffing and puffing,” he said. Bitcoin is constrained to 7 transactions per second, while Ethereum can process only 15 per second, compared to Visa’s 2,000 per second.

2017/10/11, Bitcoin Gold Is About to Trial an ASIC-Resistant Bitcoin Fork,"It’s forking season.

After Bitcoin Cash (Bcash) forked from the Bitcoin blockchain to create a new cryptocurrency (BCH), and ahead of the SegWit2X fork that may do the same thing, a third Bitcoin fork is in the making: Bitcoin Gold (Bgold; BTG). But where Bcash and SegWit2X are scaling-related forks — both mainly increase Bitcoin's block size limit — Bgold wants to re-decentralize mining by implementing a new proof-of-work algorithm.

“What was born as decentralized is now centralized,” Bitcoin Gold contributor J. Alejandro Regojo told Bitcoin Magazine, referring to the current state of Bitcoin mining. “With this fork, we want to show how Bitcoin can be as ‘Satoshi’ as possible, as social as possible, and as decentralized as possible.”

Mining Centralization
Bitcoin Gold was initiated by Jack Liao, CEO of Hong Kong–based mining hardware producer LightningASIC, and was first announced in late August. The open project has been gaining traction and support in the wider cryptocurrency space since, with a dedicated Slack as a main hub for discussion and organization. Bgold is currently being developed by the pseudonymous developer “h4x3rotab” along with a small group of volunteers contributing to the project in other ways.

The attention Bgold has attracted is probably in part because anyone who owns bitcoin (BTC) on October 25th will receive the equivalent amount of BTG. While this model has been criticized, particularly because it presents a burden on service providers and users, it has also proven successful. With the launch of Bitcoin Cash in particular, users eagerly accepted their batch of “free money,” while exchanges, wallets and other service providers proved relatively willing to integrate the new coin.

Further, the Bgold team believes that this distribution method should also benefit Bitcoin over altcoins as it provides an extra incentive to hold BTC on particular dates.

“But the key goal that we are trying to achieve with this fork is to build a perpetually ASIC-resistant version of Bitcoin,” said Robert Kuhne, another Bitcoin Gold contributor, in explaining the purpose of the project to Bitcoin Magazine.

Bgold contributors like Regojo and Kuhne think that Bitcoin’s proof-of-work hashing algorithm was essentially broken by the introduction of specialized ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) mining hardware. In the early years of Bitcoin’s existence, individual users were often also miners; this has since become concentrated into relatively centralized data centers operated by professionals.

“And we’re now in a situation where 65 percent of hash power comes from a country that doesn’t like Bitcoin,” Regojo noted, referring to China’s recent clamp down on cryptocurrencies.

An Uneven Playing Field
And while mining is centralized, ASIC production is even more centralized, the Bgold contributors pointed out. Only a handful of companies currently produce such specialized chips.

This means that anyone who wants to be a miner in any meaningful way is beholden to these companies, Kuhne argued.

“The way the monopoly manufacturer currently operates is abusive to its customers — individual miners — and the industry at large,” he said, referring to major Chinese ASIC producer Bitmain. “Manufacturers can produce ASICs at a tiny cost, but miners have to buy at a high price. This violates the one-CPU-one-vote ethos as described in the Bitcoin white paper, because while everyone can buy CPU at the same price, the same is not true for ASIC hardware.”

Regojo and Kuhne see this as a fundamental problem — not something that free market dynamics can realistically resolve. They suggest that the barrier of entry to the ASIC market to compete with existing manufacturers is fundamentally too high to allow for open competition.

“You can't build a factory without approval from the government and banking system. So there are really only a handful of entities in the world that have total authority over who can and can't manufacture ASIC machines. And all this could potentially get much worse if and when those institution really start feeling the disruption from Bitcoin, which hasn't begun in earnest yet,” Kuhne said.

Bitcoin Gold
As opposed to the Bitcoin Cash and (especially) the upcoming SegWit2X forks, Bitcoin Gold very specifically does not make a claim to be the “real” Bitcoin. Instead, the Bgold project hopes it can prove a valuable exercise for Bitcoin; a sort of test case for a hard fork that Bitcoin itself may one day require.

Concretely, Bitcoin Gold is now implementing the Equihash proof-of-work algorithm. This is already used by Zcash and is relatively ASIC-resistant.

Full ASIC-resistance, however, is thought to be impossible: Any mining algorithm could be subject to specialized chips. Like Vertcoin, the Bgold community therefore plans to re-deploy a new proof-of-work algorithm hard fork if it is found out that ASIC-chips for Equihash are being produced. (This plan alone, of course, could be a deterrent for any potential ASIC-producer.)

For security, the project plans to implement strong replay protection to avoid loss of funds for unsuspecting or non-technical users. It will also adopt a new difficulty re-target algorithm to prevent the blockchain from stalling: Difficulty is re-adjusted at every block instead of once every two weeks.

While the coin is set to launch two weeks from now, the Bgold codebase is not yet fully developed and ready to be deployed. Implementation of the new proof-of-work algorithm and replay protection, as well as the new difficulty re-adjustment scheme, are yet to be finished.

Nor are all the details for the project even ironed out.

Early announcements indicated that Bitcoin Gold would have a closed launch and a presale of coins. A new batch of BTG was to be mined in the first week after the fork and subsequently distributed to designated investors, not unlike an ICO. Proceeds of this “ICO” were then to be used for development and other Bgold-related purposes.

However, as interest in the project grew, this idea became more controversial. Not everyone involved with Bitcoin Gold likes the idea of an additional founders reward — something Bcash, for example, did not have.

Kuhne addressed the issue by stating: “We have heard a lot of feedback from the community, so this proposal will be replaced with an updated and improved plan. But we will not completely rule out the possibility of a modest pre-mine to provide a basic level of funding for the project.”

2017/10/13,A Bitcoin Beginner’s Guide to Surviving the Bgold and SegWit2x Forks,"This is an updated version of A Bitcoin Beginner's Guide to Surviving a Coin-Split specifically addressing issues associated with the upcoming Bitcoin Gold and SegWit2x forks.

It looks as if Bitcoin will experience at least two more “coin-splits” soon, which (more accurately) will result in the creation of new coins. On October 25, Bitcoin Gold (Bgold) will split off from Bitcoin to create an ASIC-resistant cryptocurrency. A few weeks later, a significant group of Bitcoin companies wants to hard fork according to the SegWit2x plan as defined in the “New York Agreement” (NYA), which will probably result in yet another new coin. 

Update: Many of these companies and the main organizers behind SegWit2x have by now decided not to move forward with their hard fork. Others may still proceed, however, so if you want to be on the safe side, the advice in this article does still hold up.

If this all plays out, there could be three distinct blockchains and three types of coins within about a month of publication of this article. One blockchain would follow the current Bitcoin protocol; for the purpose of this article, that coin will be referred to as “BTC.” The second blockchain will follow the Bgold protocol; in this article, that coin will be referred to as “BTG.” The third blockchain will follow the SegWit2x protocol; that coin will be referred to as “B2X.”

The good news is that each BTC will effectively be copied onto both the Bgold and the SegWit2x blockchains. If you hold Bitcoin private keys at the time of the forks, you should be able to access your BTG and B2X coins as well.

The bad news is that such forks can be somewhat messy and risky. If you’re not careful, it’s easy to lose your BTC or B2X, and maybe your BTG.

This guide will provide you with the basics to keep your funds safe during the upcoming forks and help to ensure you make it to the end of next month with your BTC, BTG and B2X intact.

Author’s note: If you want to play the markets as soon as possible and you are fine with taking risks, and/or you really know what you are doing, this article is probably not for you: it's a beginner's guide. Also please note that everything in this article is just advise, based on our best understanding of the situation. Much is still uncertain and subject to change.

Before the Forks (That’s Now)
First of all, be aware that coin-splits can be somewhat risky — especially controversial ones like the SegWit2x fork. While it seems unlikely for now, there is a chance some kind of cyber-battle will break out, perhaps even escalating to the point where all exchange rates drop sharply. If you want to make sure not to be caught in any crossfire, it’s best to not hold more value in bitcoin than you are willing to lose.

If you do decide to hold on to your bitcoin, make sure you are prepared before October 25, and preferably sooner. This is the day the BTG equivalent will be distributed to all BTC balances. B2X will follow a couple of weeks later, around mid-November (the exact date is not yet known).

If you are storing your bitcoins on an exchange, in a custodial service like Coinbase, Circle or Xapo, or on any other service that holds your private keys for you, you may or may not eventually receive BTC, BTG and B2X. This is not yet very clear, and if you want to keep storing your coins on such services, you should at least see if your exchange or custodial service of choice has made an official statement on the forks, perhaps on their company blog. If not, contact them to ask.

That said, if you want to be absolutely sure to be able to access your BTC, BTG and B2X, you should really control your private keys yourself. That way you don’t need to rely on any third party.

If you’re currently using a custodial service to store your bitcoins, you need to create your own wallet instead. Send or withdraw your bitcoins from the custodial service to this new wallet; this wallet then holds your private keys.

What kind of wallet you want to use is up to you. For this specific purpose it’s best to use a wallet that lets you easily access your private keys directly. (Some wallets make this easier for you than others.) But technically, any wallet that lets you control your private keys should be fine.

With that in mind, here are some basic solutions:

If you don’t care about transacting with BTC, BTG or B2X anytime soon, and really just want to keep all of them as long-term investments, a paper wallet is a good option. It should be noted, however, that this option is only really secure if you follow strict security precautions, which you can find here.

Regular wallets are about as secure as your computer (or phone). Since most computers and phones are not all that secure, these are not ideal for large amounts. With that in mind, all mobile and desktop wallets listed on bitcoin.org will store your private keys. Electrum is a good pick if you want easy access to your private keys directly.

A full-node wallet like Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots is also a good pick, as it’s not too hard to access your private keys with these wallets either. As a bonus, these wallets give you a little extra security on the Bitcoin blockchain (shortly) after the SegWit2X fork, because these wallets enforce all of Bitcoin's current protocol rules. However, these types of wallets are more resource-intensive to use, compared to most other wallets.

Another option is to get a hardware wallet. Any of the hardware wallets listed on bitcoin.org will keep your private keys secure. However, these wallets typically don’t let you easily access your private keys directly. It’s not clear that all these wallets will let you access BTG in particular, and not all of them have given a guarantee for B2X either. So while these wallets will safely store your private keys, it could be a bit more tricky (but probably not impossible) to get ahold of all three coins later.

In any case: Be sure to make backups of your keys! Most wallets require you to do this when installing; don’t skip this step.

Shortly After the Bitcoin Gold Fork (and Before the SegWit2x Fork)
The Bitcoin Gold fork is sometimes referred to as a “friendly fork.” This is mainly because it has no intention of claiming to be the “real” Bitcoin, and it plans to implement strong replay protection.

In short, this replay protection means that you won’t accidentally send your BTG when you mean to send BTC (or the other way around). So even after you’ve spent your BTC, you can still access your BTG.

If you want to transact with your BTC before the SegWit2x fork, it could come in handy later to write down which of your Bitcoin addresses and/or private keys had BTG attributed to them — in other words, which of your Bitcoin addresses had any BTC on them at the time of the Bgold fork on October 25th.

But there’s no rush to actually access your BTG. In fact, it will probably take at least a week before this is even possible, and maybe longer. It’s therefore probably best to ignore this fork until after the SegWit2x fork. That way you’ll only need to go through the process of claiming all your new coins once.

After the SegWit2x Fork
Unfortunately, the SegWit2x fork could play out a bit more messily.

For one, several of the companies backing SegWit2x consider this fork an upgrade of Bitcoin itself. They therefore currently have no intention to adopt a new name for it. Some of them will call or list (what this article refers to as) SegWit2x and B2X, as ""Bitcoin"" and ""BTC"". Meanwhile, they might call or list (what this article refers to as) BTC as ""B1X"", or another ticker.

And of course, all coins will command their own exchange rates. So as different exchanges list a different coin as ""BTC"", the price for ""BTC"" could differ vastly across exchanges: they're actually different coins! You should therefore not buy or sell any coin listed as ""BTC"", unless and until you are very sure which coin your exchange lists as ""BTC"".

Additionally, it currently seems SegWit2x will fork without strong replay protection. This means that post-fork, BTC transactions and B2X transactions will look identical and could both be valid on both blockchains.

Therefore, spending coins on the BTC blockchain could make you accidentally spend the “equivalent” B2X on the SegWit2x blockchain, and the other way around. Instead of paying someone only BTC, you may unintentionally send B2X as well — or vice versa. The BTCs and B2Xs are initially “stuck together.”

To be on the safe side, you should probably not spend an coins after the SegWit2x fork at all. As explained below, you'll first need to ""split"" your coins.

Furthermore, some light wallets (mobile wallets) will display whichever blockchain has more hash power attributed to it. This means that the balance on your screen could be a BTC balance or a B2X balance, and there will be no way to tell the difference. (Even if the wallet says it’s a BTC balance!)

To be on the safe side, you should not accept any payments with light wallets, since you could receive B2X when you’re expecting BTC, or the other way around. At the very least, you should make absolutely sure that your wallet displays what you think it displays. (Wallets like Electrum and GreenAddress should display BTC as ""BTC"" regardless of hashpower distribution.) If you use a full-node wallet like Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots and you want to accept BTC, that should also be fine.

Depending on how much hash power is dedicated to each chain, it is possible that transactions will confirm (significantly) slower than usual for some time and will require higher fees to confirm at all.

Claiming Your Coins
If all three chains survive, and you control your private keys, you should be able to access BTC, BTG and B2X around mid-November.

Claiming your BTG should be relatively easy, assuming there are wallets available for it. Most likely, you’d simply need to insert your private keys (or private key seed) into such a wallet.

However, there are some security and privacy risks in doing so. It’s too soon to tell exactly what these risks will look like as it’s unclear which wallets will support BTG. (It’s not even certain that any wallets will.) But in general, you’ll first want to move your BTC (and B2X) to new addresses or whole new wallets before accessing your BTG.

Since there’s no need to rush, it’s probably best just to wait on claiming your BTG until there is more clarity. By that time, Bitcoin Magazine will publish a follow-up article explaining how to do this.

Securely accessing and using your B2X (and BTC) might prove a bit more tricky, mostly because of the risk of replay attacks. This requires that the BTC and B2X are split from each other, which will be possible but could prove a bit complex.

Some wallets might split the coins for you, but it's too soon to know which wallets will. Additionally, exchanges will likely set up coin-splitting services and take care of most of this complexity behind the screens. You’d then just need to send your BTC or B2X to an exchange, and the exchange will credit your account with both BTC and B2X. (They should even replay the transaction for you to make sure they indeed receive both your coins and can split them for you.) There may also be other solutions to split your coins, but that remains to be seen.

By mid-November, there will probably also be dedicated wallets for both BTC and B2X. Of course, you may need to upgrade your existing wallet or download a new wallet. This also remains to be seen.

Further specifics on what to do after the forks will be announced on Bitcoin Magazine once the forks have occurred and we have a better understanding of the post-fork situation.

So, to Recap ...
1. It’s best to control your private keys yourself before October 25, and hold on to them until after the SegWit2x fork, mid-November.

2. To be on the safe side, avoid buying or selling any ""BTC"" and don't make any transactions shortly after the SegWit2x fork.

3. As the dust settles after the SegWit2x fork, access and split your coins. (How to do this will be explained on Bitcoin Magazine once there is more clarity.)",Technical,0.296
2017/10/19,What Lightning Will Look Like: Lightning Labs Has Announced Its User Interface Wallet,"Development of the lightning network, the highly-anticipated second-layer Bitcoin protocol for instant microtransactions, continues to inch forward.

Lightning Labs, major contributor to the lightning network daemon, lnd, announced its cross-platform Lightning Desktop App last week. The open-source lightning wallet is essentially a user interface (UI) built on top of lnd and powered by Lightning Labs’ new open-source Bitcoin light client, Neutrino.

“This is the first functioning user interface for both sending and receiving lightning transactions with a light client mode,” Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark told Bitcoin Magazine.

The lightning network is currently being developed by several teams working on different but interoperable implementations of the protocol. Several of these implementations are functional, though only on Bitcoin’s test network (“testnet”): a sort of copy of the Bitcoin network with valueless coins specifically designed for testing new applications and more.

But, while there are already several lightning daemons available for testnet, most are only usable via command line tools. Developers Olaoluwa Osuntokun, Bryan Vu and Case Sandberg collaborated to now extend lnd with the new Lightning Desktop App to provide a user interface.

“I think the big takeaway is being able to visualize this technology and see what an early UI might look like,” said Stark. “It's one thing to be using the command line, as our lnd testers and developers have been, but it's another to be able to download the app. Being able to see this kind of progress is important.”

As part of the announcement, Lightning Labs also introduced Neutrino, the new open-source Bitcoin light client that powers the Lightning Desktop App. As a main benefit, Neutrino users don’t need to download the entire Bitcoin blockchain, which is currently over 140 gigabytes in size. This makes the desktop app much more accessible to regular users who transact small amounts, for which the lightning network is particularly suited. And because Neutrino uses a new method of transaction filtering (client side instead of bloom filters), it offers more privacy than most light clients, too.

The release of the new Lightning Desktop App kicks off a two-week “testing blitz,” as the company described it in their accompanying blog post. Developers are invited to experiment with the desktop app itself, as well as with Neutrino. Further, it makes it much easier for anyone to play around with lnd and the lightning network itself.

“The really cool thing about having our desktop app out there is now there's an easy way for people to interact with all of the apps that developers are building on Lightning, such as Yalls,” said Stark.

After the two-week testing period, the implementation will enter a regular release cycle. Releasing the wallet for Bitcoin mainnet, however, could take a while longer still, Stark explained:

“We're working toward testing and making the software more stable before releasing a beta. This is financial software and its a protocol dealing with money, so we want to ensure people can have a good user experience.”

There is no specific deadline for the beta release, but Stark added that, ""The next step is for us to gather feedback from testers and develop it further, along with improvements in lnd and Neutrino.""

The open-source Lightning Desktop App code is available on GitHub.",Technical,0.3612
2017/11/8,NO2X: Hard Fork “Suspended” Due to Lack of Consensus,"There will almost certainly be no Bitcoin hard fork next week: the main organizers behind the SegWit2x project have “suspended” their efforts.

In an email to the SegWit2x mailing list, one of the main organizers behind the project, BitGo CEO Mike Belshe, explained that the proposed hard fork has not been able to gain sufficient consensus to proceed:

“Although we strongly believe in the need for a larger blocksize, there is something we believe is even more important: keeping the community together. Unfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for a clean blocksize upgrade at this time.”

The New York Agreement was originally forged between a group of Bitcoin companies in May of this year. An initiative by Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert, the project — later dubbed “SegWit2x” — was to combine activation of the Segregated Witness soft fork with a hard fork to double Bitcoin’s block weight limit. With Segregated Witness activated on the Bitcoin network this past summer, arguablyhelped by the SegWit2x project, the hard fork was scheduled to take place next week.

However, the hard fork part of the New York Agreement was always controversial for a number of reasons. As a result, a growing number of signatories dropped out of the agreement over the past weeks and months, while developers, user communities, public polls, future markets and more all indicated limited support for the effort. And as the hard fork date drew closer, it become increasingly clear that SegWit2x would in fact spawn a new currency rather than constitute an upgrade of the Bitcoin protocol.

And this was never the plan, Belshe wrote:

“Continuing on the current path could divide the community and be a setback to Bitcoin’s growth. This was never the goal of Segwit2x.”

Belshe’s email was also signed on behalf of Xapo CEO Wences Casares, Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu, Bloq CEO Jeff Garzik, BlockchainCEO Peter Smith and ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees. In a separateblog post published just before Belshe’s email, BitPay CEO Stephen Pair also called for cancelation of the hard fork.

While the New York Agreement was signed by even more companies (and some individuals), and anyone can still deploy the hard fork, it is unlikely that anyone will proceed with the hard fork in any meaningful way.

Belshe does, however, note that a hard fork to increase Bitcoin’s block weight limit might be needed in the future, writing:

“As fees rise on the blockchain, we believe it will eventually become obvious that on-chain capacity increases are necessary. When that happens, we hope the community will come together and find a solution, possibly with a blocksize increase.”",Technical,-0.4019
2017/11/10,De-briefing Ethereum’s Parity Predicament: What’s Next?,"After an unidentified actor “accidentally” triggered a series of bugs that destroyed approximately $150 million worth of digital currency, the world waits for a substantive answer — is this vulnerability an anomaly? An “I told you so”? Or a humbling opportunity to secure the Ethereum network?

What Happened?
On November 6, “Devops199,” an alleged amateur programmer, set off a chain of bugs on Parity, a popular digital wallet for Ethereum. These bugs affected multisignature, or “multisig,” accounts — “wallets” that require multiple users to sign off with their keys before funds can be transferred.. The place these wallets connect to is known as a “library” contract.

According to Parity, an attempt to fix a vulnerability that allowed hackers to steal $32 million from multisignature wallets in July of 2017 inadvertently created a second vulnerability in the library contract. This allowed Devops199 gain sole ownership of the library that every multisignature wallet used for their code.

After Devops199 realized what had happened, he “killed” (deleted) the code. Unfortunately, this locked all funds into multisignature wallets permanently, with no way to access them.

Because of the functionality of the current blockchain, $150 million worth of ether (ETH), the tradable currency that fuels the Ethereum platform, is now effectively destroyed and inaccessible to anyone.

Among the victims of this bug are several recently successful ICOs that chose to store their funds in a Parity wallet because of its multisig option and compatibility with various hardware wallets.

Parity’s Response (So Far)
On November 7, tweets on Parity’s official Twitter account acknowledged the vulnerability and confirmed that the funds affected are frozen and can’t be moved anywhere.

A day later, on November 8, Parity de-briefed the bug, explaining that it was indeed possible to turn the Parity Wallet Library contract into a regular multisig wallet and become the owner of it, which is exactly what Devops199 did. Parity now has a tool to check if a user/wallet has been affected by the vulnerability.

Parity’s History of Hacks
This isn’t the first time Parity has fallen victim to a security exploit. Parity’s multisignature contracts were previously the target of three thefts totalling 150,000 ether in July of 2017 (the second-largest hack after the DAO fiasco). And losses could have been exponentially higher. However, the “White Hat Group,” a collection of hackers and activists, was able to intervene and drain the majority of other wallets before they could be compromised as well.

Future multi-sig wallets created in all versions of Parity Wallet have no known exploits.
 - Official Parity website post following the July 19 hack
Jeff Coleman, an expert in blockchain technologies and currently a researcher and advisor with L4 Ventures, described Parity’s response to the July 19, 2017, attack as having been “worrying, to say the least.”

Coleman told Bitcoin Magazine that his primary concerns centered around Parity’s inadequate response and its tendency to downplay the significance of the compromise, choosing instead to blame a large number of external causes:

They blamed observers for not finding the bug before it was exploited; they blamed lack of incentivization for observers; and they blamed the Solidity language for not blocking access by default to the functions the [Parity team] failed to protect.
He further noted that Parity seemed to be blaming the complexity of the well-audited wallet (which they still believed to be secure) from which they had originally modified their code. And also that Parity didn’t take responsibility for their own inadequate quality control and audit procedures.

S.O.S.?
Developers in the community are desperately trying to find a fix to the Parity predicament. Coleman believes that “from a technological perspective, there is nothing short of a hard fork [a non-backward-compatible change to the Ethereum protocol] to restore the destroyed funds.”

After the DAO hack in 2016, the Ethereum Foundation had already accepted a hard fork to restore lost funds, with the common understanding that this was a sort of “mulligan” — a one-time fix for a young, developing blockchain. This scenario, nevertheless, divided the Ethereum blockchain into two parts and created Ethereum Classic, the original Ethereum blockchain, backed by a community that vehemently opposes editing transaction history to restore lost funds.

Using hard forks as interventions to “correct” worst-case scenarios like this is highly controversial, especially since blockchains are meant to be immutable. So, it’s difficult to convince the Ethereum community to use a hard fork to rescue one team from a mistake. While many acknowledge sympathy for smaller accounts storing personal ETH, sentiment is not as sympathetic for the 300,000 ETH that belonged to the Polkadot Project, project associated with the Parity team.

Arseny Reutov, an application security researcher for blockchain security firm positive.com, affirmed this community sentiment, while acknowledging that hard forks can be solutions. However, he agrees that Ethereum cannot simply hard fork any time there is a problem on the network. He believes blockchains should expect “more and more high profile thefts and incidents,” and that the problem lies in the infant Ethereum platform itself — specifically, in the native Solidity programming language.

If a Hard Fork Isn’t the Answer, Then What Is?
Both Coleman and Reutov believe that the key to gaining the community support necessary to restore funds is to combine the Parity situation with similar situations in which funds have been lost due to various kinds of mistakes. As an example, Coleman referenced those detailed in EIP 156: “Reclaiming of ether in common classes of stuck accounts.”

Coleman also pointed out that in any of these instances, it must be “completely unambiguous who the original owners of the assets were.” The necessary changes could then be made and packaged together in an “already planned hard fork, such as the upcoming Constantinople fork.”

Even so, restoring funds is problematic. Ethereum core developers must discern which mistake-affected funds will be returned to users. Will all funds be returned or only a select few — or will this be a ~500,000 ETH learning experience?",Technical,-0.9842
2017/11/16,The Lightning Network Now Supports Transactions Across Blockchains ,"Although still in testing phase, the lightning network can now be used to send transactions across different blockchains. The Lightning Labs development team successfully swapped testnet bitcoin for testnet litecoin through a lightning channel this week: ownership of the coins changed hands, while no transaction was recorded on either blockchain.

“Previous atomic swaps that I have done were on-chain, and had the on-chain limitations of slow [transactions] and high transaction fees,” Litecoin creator Charlie Lee told Bitcoin Magazine, referring to an older trick to exchange different types of coins trustlessly. “Off-chain atomic swaps are significantly better. They are instant, [have] low fees, and better protect one’s privacy.”

The successful test paves the way for trustless cryptocurrency exchanges, near-seamless multi-coin payment processors and more.

Bitcoin and Litecoin
The lightning network is the highly anticipated second-layer payment network to be deployed on top of Bitcoin. And as an open protocol, it’s relatively easy to deploy lightning network support for other cryptocurrencies that are forked from Bitcoin’s codebase — like Litecoin.

Interestingly, if the lightning network runs on different blockchains, these chains can effectively be linked together. If one or several peers on the network are willing to take one type of coin and forward another, it’s possible to send bitcoins on one end of a channel that will end up as the equivalent in litecoin on the other end.

In a Medium post published in the first week of 2017, Lee explained that this potential to create these kinds of “bridges” between cryptocurrencies made him throw his weight behind the Segregated Witness (SegWit) soft forks on both Litecoin and Bitcoin.

When SegWit activated on Litecoin last spring, Lee’s vision came one step closer to reality. Because the soft fork had not yet activated on Bitcoin at that time, Lightning Labs decided to add Litecoin support to their LND lightning network implementation. Thus, by the time SegWit activated on Bitcoin last summer, LND was already compatible with both chains.

The testnet versions of these two blockchains are now made interoperable through the lightning network for the first time, allowing users to swap one type of coin for the other.

“The primary advantages over previous solutions are speed, cost and privacy,” Lightning Labs developer Conner Fromknecht told Bitcoin Magazine. “Transfers are more or less instant, and don’t require the cost of an on-chain transaction. Additionally, in the cooperative case, the transactions are never broadcast, and leave no trace on the blockchain, offering privacy benefits. And with any luck, these privacy benefits will only continue to improve.”

The Test (and the Potential)
This week’s specific test was done on a local machine, on which Fromknecht himself created two nodes: “Alice” and “Bob.” These two nodes were modified to be able to monitor both the Bitcoin and Litecoin testnets. Fromknecht then created a single lightning channel that sent testnet litecoin from Alice to Bob and testnet bitcoin back from Bob to Alice at a fixed exchange rate. While still all in an experimental setting, the test was successful; Lightning Labs today published a blog post and a video detailing the results.

In addition to offering a faster, cheaper and more private solution to exchanging coins, the successful test paves the way toward a whole new range of possibilities in the context of the lightning network. For example, peers on the network could eventually act as cryptocurrency exchanges, competing with one another to offer the best exchange rates.

“Arguably the most important benefit of Lightning swaps is the ability to efficiently exchange different currencies without a custodian,” Fromknecht said. “Our ecosystem heavily depends on exchanges to fulfill this role today, but Lightning swaps offer users a choice to get the best of both worlds — instant exchanges without relinquishing control of your money.”

Similarly, such exchangers could act as payment processors: it would be much easier for users to spend litecoin at merchants that only accept bitcoin (or vice versa). And it’s even conceivable that bitcoin-to-bitcoin payments over the lightning network will route via Litecoin hubs, if that’s the cheapest way to get funds from A to B.

For Lee, at least, this is not as unlikely as it sounds, and the successful tests mark another step toward his vision for the lightning network on Litecoin and Bitcoin.

“The Litecoin team is excited to work with Lightning Labs to explore the true potential of instant cross-chain atomic swaps,” he concluded.

2017/11/16,A Beginner’s Guide to Claiming Your Bitcoin Gold (and Selling It),"This is a re-write of “A Beginner’s Guide to Claiming Your ‘Bitcoin Cash’ (and Selling It)”. Please note: Everything in this article is just advice based on our best understanding of the current situation.

Bitcoin Gold (also referred to as Bgold, and trading under the ticker BTG) launched November 12, 2017. Since the Bitcoin blockchain technically forked on Bitcoin block 491407, anyone who held bitcoin (BTC) on October 24, 2017 should have an equivalent amount of BTG attributed to their Bitcoin private keys.

In our beginner’s guide to surviving the Bgold and SegWit2x forks, we explained how to secure your private keys so you could be sure to access your BTG and B2X. The B2X fork has since been suspended by the leaders of that project, however, and it currently seems very unlikely to happen in any serious way.

As such, this follow-up article explains how you can claim (and potentially use) your BTG — only your BTG.

Be Careful
Good news: Bitcoin Gold enforces strong replay protection. This means you can’t accidentally spend your BTC when you mean to spend BTG or vice versa.

As such, if you don’t care about BTG at all right now, you don’t need to do a thing. You can just keep using bitcoin as you always have. If you ever change your mind (and don’t lose your Bitcoin private keys in the meantime), you can still claim your BTG at any point in the future.

Likewise, if you want to hold onto your BTG long term, you also don’t need to do anything right now. You can keep using BTC as if nothing happened; just make sure to never lose your private keys.

(In both these cases, however, it could come in handy to keep a record of the Bitcoin addresses that stored your bitcoins at the time of the split. This is not strictly necessary, but your future self may thank you if you do it. You should be able to find this information in your wallet of choice, though where you find it may differ a little bit from wallet to wallet. Alternatively, you could move all your coins to a new address. If you then look up all your transactions since October 25, 2017, and note which addresses spent coins since that date, you know which addresses held coins at the time of the split.)

Now let’s assume you do care about BTG right now, at least enough to want to sell your share. (1 BTG is trading around 0.02 BTC at the time of writing of this article, so you could earn a 2 percent “dividend” on your BTC if you decide to sell.)

If you followed the advice outlined in our beginner’s guide, the good news is that you should be in full control of your Bitcoin private keys. This means you now hold BTC as well as BTG.

The bad news is that it’s not necessarily easy or safe to claim your BTG. If you’re using insecure (or even malicious) software, you may accidentally expose your private keys. And because these are the same private keys that secure your BTC, this exposure could lead to your BTC being stolen. You stand to lose much more from losing your BTC than you stand to gain from selling your BTG.

Therefore, you are going to want to take your time and make sure you understand what you are doing well enough to do it without exposing your private keys. Your BTG isn’t going anywhere.

Accessing Your Coins
In our beginner’s guide to surviving the Bgold (and SegWit2x) forks, we explained how to secure your private keys and recommended different wallet options. Here, you can find, per option, how to access your BTG.

Note that while it’s not strictly necessary in all cases, it’s probably best to first move your bitcoins (BTC) to a new address, or even a whole new wallet with a new seed, before you even touch your BTG. This way you don’t add any security risks, while it’s potentially also a bit better for privacy. (More on this below.)

Update: It was pointed out to us that the Coinomi wallet is now closed source. This means that you should definitely follow the suggested advice, and first move your BTC to a new address or a whole new wallet with a new seed before inserting your private keys into the Coinomi wallet!

Paper Wallet
The first recommendation in our beginner’s guide to surviving the Bgold (and SegWit2x) forks was to use a paper wallet. This advice was given in the context of storing your coins long term in particular. But if you want to access your BTG, you can, of course, do this right away.

However, the point of a paper wallet really is that your private keys are not stored in any device that could be hacked. Therefore, if you’re going to upload your private key into a Bitcoin Gold wallet, you should definitely create a whole new paper wallet with a new private key for your bitcoin (BTC). It’s probably best to then first sweep your private keys with a Bitcoin (BTC) wallet, and then send the coins to this new paper wallet for BTC.

Electrum and Coinomi are two wallets that allow you to sweep Bitcoin private keys. Look for the “sweep” option in the menus of these wallets; that’s where you can scan the QR-code displayed on your paper wallet. (Alternatively, you could type in the private key.) Once you’ve done this, send the bitcoins to the new paper wallet.

Once your bitcoins are stored safely on the new paper wallet (ideally after at least one confirmation), the old paper wallet still holds the BTG.

Now, the same trick must be repeated to access your BTG. Electrum does not support BTG, but Coinomi does. Coinomi also published a blog post explaining exactly how to access your BTG. This includes instructions for paper wallets.

Regular Wallet
Our second recommendation was to use a regular wallet, as listed on bitcoin.org.

How to access your BTG if you were using a regular wallet differs from one wallet to the next. But in most cases, Coinomi is once again the best wallet to import your keys into. While originally written for Bitcoin Cash, this Coinomi blog post explains exactly how to make that switch for a number of wallets. (Just mentally replace “BCH” for “BTG” wherever relevant.)

Full Node Wallet
Our third recommendation was to use a full node wallet, like Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots.

These wallets store your private keys in a dedicated folder on your computer. You can make a backup of this folder using the menu in your wallet and select ""Backup wallet."" Once you’ve done this, you should be able to import this backup into the Bitcoin Gold full node, Bitcoin Gold Core.

But once again, it’s a lot easier (and possibly even safer) to export your private keys from your Bitcoin full node and import them into the Coinomi mobile wallet. While originally written for Bitcoin Cash, this Coinomi blog post explains how to do that for BTG as well. (Just mentally replace “BCH” for “BTG” wherever relevant.)

Hardware Wallet
We also recommended using a hardware wallet to keep your private keys secure — though we also noted that these wallets don’t necessarily make it easy to access your BTG.

Indeed, at the time of writing, no hardware wallet has enabled access to BTG. However, Ledger and Trezor have published blog posts indicating that they will be working on it. If you use either of these wallets, keep an eye out for announcements on their social media or blogs. Digital Bitbox and Keep Key have also published blog posts on the Bgold fork, suggesting they might support it; but they don’t support it yet. Keep an eye on their social media and blog to see if that changes.

Other (Non-bitcoin.org) Wallets, Exchanges, etc.
If you did not follow our advice and instead stored your BTC in any other wallet, or on an exchange, or anywhere else, you may or may not still be able to claim your BTG. In this case, you’ll have to figure out for yourself whether this is the case or not, and how to do so. This Coinomi blog post may, once again, be of help for some wallets. (Just mentally replace “BCH” for “BTG” wherever relevant.)

Using (or Selling) Your BTG
Once you have claimed your BTG, you can use it however you please. Just like any other altcoin, you could, for example, sell it for BTC or perhaps spend it somewhere if it’s accepted for payment, etc.

If you decide to sell your BTG, there are a number of exchanges where you can do this. The Bitcoin Gold website lists most of them here. (Which of these you decide to trust is up to you; we’re not giving any particular advice.)

But there are three more factors to keep in mind before doing so.

The first factor is privacy. Your public keys (which are linked to your BTC and BTG addresses) are identical for BTC and BTG. This means that whenever you spend your BTG (for example, to send them to an exchange), you do not only reveal your BTG addresses but also your BTC addresses. This can, in turn, reveal a lot about your current holdings as well as your past and future transactions and can even, by extension, reveal other data about people or entities you transact with. Make sure you are comfortable with giving up this privacy if you are going to send your BTG to an exchange or anywhere else.

The second factor is mostly theoretical at this point but worth a quick mention nonetheless:  security. By revealing your public key when spending BTG, you strip away one layer of cryptographic security, even for your BTC addresses. This doesn’t mean that your BTC are insecure right now, but there is an increased chance that your BTC won’t be secure at some point in the (far) future when this particular cryptographic standard is weakened. It is, therefore, best to move your BTC to a new address, at least some time within the next couple of years.

The third factor was already mentioned but bears repeating: If you’re using insecure software to claim your BTG, your BTC may be at risk. It’s probably best to move your BTC to a new address or even a whole new wallet with a new wallet seed before you even start meddling with BTG — regardless of which wallet you were using. That way, if you do mess up with insecure BTG software, you shouldn't lose your BTC.

So, to Recap …
1. You don’t have to do anything if you don’t want to, and there is no rush. If your private keys are secure, your BTG is secure.

2. If you want to use your BTG in any way, it's probably best to first move your BTC to a whole new address that you control, or even to a whole new wallet generated from a new seed. (But don’t lose your old private keys or seed: These still hold your BTG!)

3. Once you know what you’re doing, upload your private keys into a Bitcoin Gold wallet, like Coinomi. Then you can keep it, spend it, perhaps send it to an exchange to sell or whatever it is you want to do with your “free money.”",Technical,0.9986
2017/11/17,Now the SegWit2x Hard Fork Has Really Failed to Activate,"In case there were any remaining doubts, it now seems clear that the SegWit2x hard fork will not happen.

The SegWit2x project, a product of the New York Agreement signed onto by a long list of companies and miners in May, had scheduled a hard fork to double Bitcoin’s block weight limit today. And while the controversial effort was suspended by leaders of the project last week, this would not have stopped anyone else from proceeding with it. Companies like Coinbase were indeed taking into account that the SegWit2x hard fork could still happen.

The Fork That Wasn’t
SegWit2x nodes — most notably btc1 — were programmed to fork away from the Bitcoin blockchain this afternoon (UTC) to create the SegWit2x blockchain and a new currency, often referred to as B2X. However, not a single SegWit2x block has been mined since fork point, nor is there any indication that this is likely to happen. For all intents and purposes, there is no SegWit2x — nor a B2X.

Further, software bugs in the btc1 codebase made all btc1 implementations grind to a halt even before it reached the expected fork point. While Bitcoin and SegWit2x nodes were widely expected to share a single blockchain up until block 494783 and then to go their own ways at block 494784, btc1 nodes never made it past block 494782.

This is mainly because the first block on the SegWit2x chain was required to have a “base block” larger than one megabyte. This is how the chain would diverge from the original Bitcoin protocol. But due to what is referred to as an “off-by-one error,” SegWit2x blocks started to reject smaller-than-one-megabyte blocks one block too soon — at block 494,783 instead of 494,784.

Moreover, another btc1 bug prevented miners from mining a big enough block when it was needed. So even if some miners did want to proceed with the fork, they accidentally wouldn’t have done so — at least not automatically. Miners would instead have had to manually configure their block weight settings, but it’s unlikely they knew about this step. Btc1 maintainer Jeff Garzik (while also denying there was a problem) has since released a patch to resolve this issue.

But judging by the absence of any SegWit2x blocks, the patch hasn’t made a difference, most likely because few, if any, miners were interested in mining on the SegWit2x chain in the first place.

NO2X?
Despite the seeming failure of SegWit2x to take off in any way, it should be noted that there is technically no way to declare a fork like SegWit2x officially “dead” or “failed.”

While unlikely, it’s always possible that the SegWit2x hard fork could proceed at some point in the future. In fact, there is no way to tell whether the SegWit2x chain is currently being mined with a little bit of hash power right now, and it is strictly impossible to foresee whether it will be mined later on. Perhaps a SegWit2x block will be found a day from now, a week from now or even ten years from now, at which point SegWit2x and B2X will technically come into existence.

However, since the SegWit2x chain did not include a mining difficulty reset, it will be as hard to mine a B2X block as it currently is to mine a BTC block. Meanwhile, market support for B2X appears to be extremely low, with B2X futures trading below 2 percent of BTC. So even if miners decide to mine B2X blocks, they’d almost certainly be earning far less than they would by mining BTC. Or, more accurately, they’d spend more on electricity bills than they’d be able to earn by mining B2X. The financial incentive to mine the SegWit2x chain just isn’t there.


Alternatively, SegWit2x could see a bit of a rebirth in the form of “BitcoinX” (BTX). This project, supposedly started by disappointed SegWit2x supporters, will take a snapshot of bitcoin balances at block height 494,783 and start a SegWit2x-like altcoin that offers all BTC holders the equivalent amount in BTX. Though, while this coin is arguably more viable than B2X thanks to a mining difficulty reset and more, it really is a new coin — arguably even more so than B2X would have been.",Technical,-0.9815
2017/11/22, Goodbye Bugs? How Formal Verification Could Fortify Smart Contracts,"As a way to eliminate bugs in high-risk code, a style of software programming known as formal verification is making its way into the blockchain world.

Put simply, formal verification uses math to specify and analyze a program for errors in logic. However, because of the time and cost involved, formal verification is best reserved for situations where human life or large sums of money are at stake.

Currently, formal verification is used to verify the correctness of high-risk code in transportation, the military and cryptography. Chip companies use it to fortify algorithms before embedding them in silicon. And banks use it to develop financial algorithms.

Applied to blockchain technology, formal verification could provide assurances that self-executing transactions known as smart contracts will work as intended, eliminating some of the bugs and financial losses that come as a result of coding errors.

This year alone, bugs in Ethereum’s Parity wallet accounted for $180 million in losses. Last year, a bug in a virtual organization known as The DAO enabled a hacker to siphon $50 million from the Ethereum smart contract.  

Platforms like Cardano and Tezos are already working on smart contract languages specifically designed to facilitate formal verification. Ethereum is also working on bringing formal verification to its smart contracts.

But what is formal verification? How does it work? And why is software so difficult to get right in the first place?

To Err Is Human
Software is inherently unforgiving. If you are constructing a building, you can leave out a nail or a screw, and the structure still stands. But when it comes to software, something as simple as a single typo can cause the entire program to stop working.

“Programming languages are incredibly powerful,” Gerard Holzmann, former lead scientist at NASA, explained in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. “As a programmer, you have to deal with a lot of detail, and unless you get every detail right, there is some effect.”  

The traditional approach to getting software right is testing. After you write an algorithm, you input a variable and check to see if it gives back the correct output. But how do you test every single input? You can’t. There are too many to test, and there could be errors lurking in the cases that you do not test.

“There are so many possible executions that really, when you test or execute, you just scratch the surface of what is possible,” Holzmann said.

Put another way, testing only looks for the presence of bugs, not the absence of bugs, and one small mistake could have devastating results.  

“If you take any failure of a system, like Fukushima and Three Mile Island, and look at the sequence of events that led to that failure, it is always fascinating because there are so many things that nobody could have predicted that would happen in a particular accommodation,” said Holzmann. “Same as in software; so many things can happen.”

In contrast, instead of testing one situation at a time, formal verification is a way to test that a program works in every situation. What you care about is whether the logic holds true, and the best way to check that logic is with a computer.  

“A formalism for me has the purpose that you can reason about things, and the most useful way of reasoning about things is if you can program a machine to do the reasoning for you,” said Holzmann.

Making a Plan
Generally, the first step in formal verification is to create a mathematical model. The math needed is not complicated; it’s just basic logic written up in a so-called “formal language” that is machine checkable.  

Typically, the process of specifying a model begins with a stakeholder who understands what the system needs to do. In the case of a medical device, the stakeholder might be a doctor; in the case of a smart contract, it might be a lawyer or a banker, or both.

The job of a stakeholder is to convey the information in her head to a requirements engineer who collects that information and creates the model. The process begins informally with discussions and abstractions, but ends formally with a precise mathematical specification.

This is not easy. It is a time consuming, iterative process that can take months, depending on the situation, but it often brings a clarity to a situation that was not there before because it forces programmers to think deeply about the behavior of a software.

“You can think of it as laws and regulations,” said Andreas Zeller, professor of software engineering at Saarland University in Saarbruecken, Germany, who likens creating a formal specification to developing a plan for a building.

“You refine the regulations,” he told Bitcoin Magazine. “But if you do not have regulations in the first place, your building crashes, and that is when you realize, you had better make a plan.”   

Checking the Logic
Once a model is specified, the next step is to verify the model’s logic with proofs. This is a critical step in the process. “If you do not have a proof, you do not have a guarantee that the model, as it is, will work,” explained Zeller.

But because you have to make explicit every single logical step, proofs can be immensely long and complex. In the past, this made formal verification agonizingly difficult. Even the simplest statement could require dozens of theorems and lemmas.

Fortunately, these days, many formal systems use automated theorem provers, like Coq, Isabelle or Metamath, that can check or even partially construct a formal proof.

Once a model is proven to work, the next step is building your program. But you still must make sure the software you build conforms to the specification.  

This is where functional programming languages like ML, Haskell, OCaml or F# enter into the picture. Because these languages are closer to algebra in their expressiveness, they are a better match for formal verification than languages like C, Java, or JavaScript.

For this reason, Tezos is written in OCaml and Cardano is written in Haskell, so changes to the protocol are easier to formally verify. (A formal specification for Ouroboros Praos, the next generation of the consensus algorithm powering Cardano, is already in the works.) Similarly, Tezos’ smart contract language Michelson is based on OCaml; Cardano’s smart contract language Plutus is based on Haskell.

Pros and Cons
On the plus side, formal verification allows computer scientists greater assurances in developing software. On the negative side, because of the rigor involved, formal methods can be a time-consuming, costly undertaking for projects developing the code.

Because of this, formal methods are best used to guarantee smaller building blocks of code that get reused over and over. You would not use it for, say, an entire operating system, but only those parts of a system that require the highest safety or security assurances.  

Naturally, any type of security comes at a cost. The question is, how much security will blockchain and smart contract developers be willing to pay for?

If you want something that is error free, “you had better be prepared to spend tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars for people who will provide a full proof,” cautioned Zeller.  

On the other hand, for smart contracts securing tens of millions of dollars in funds, those costs may be well worth it. Looking at it another way, in a competitive environment, formal verification could make smart contracts more appealing to the consumer.

If, for instance, you had the choice of entrusting your funds to a smart contract that had been formally verified versus one that has not, which one would you choose?",Technical,0.4019
2017/11/27,Scriptless Scripts: How Bitcoin Can Support Smart Contracts Without Smart Contracts,"Bitcoin’s capacity is limited. Meanwhile, smart contracts can be resource intensive. So even though Bitcoin has always supported basic smart contract functionality, the two have never been a natural match.

But a recent topic of research spearheaded by Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra could help fix this. Recently presented as key part of his presentation at Scaling Bitcoin Stanford, “Scriptless Scripts” have the potential to completely move certain smart contracts off of Bitcoin’s blockchain — while still leveraging all of Bitcoin’s security.

Bitcoin and Smart Contracts
Smart contracts, first proposed by digital currency veteran Nick Szabo in the 1990s, are essentially self-executing contracts. Most typically, they send money from someone to someone else if specific conditions are met. For example, if someone streams a song, a payment is automated from the streamer to the artist.

While smart contracts are often associated with “second generation” blockchains like Ethereum, Bitcoin has always supported basic smart contracts, too. In a way, any Bitcoin transaction is technically a smart contract: Funds are typically moved on the condition that a valid cryptographic signature is provided. Slightly more advanced smart contracts — such as multisig and timelocks — are used to enable second-layer protocols like the Lightning Network.

But there are problems with blockchain-based smart contracts. For one, as they grow more complex, they require more resources to execute. This is especially problematic because all nodes on the network need to execute the contract — not just the parties involved with the contract itself.

This network-wide execution also means that the parties involved have no privacy regarding what their smart contract entails: The entire network will know exactly what it looks like. By extension, this is bad for fungibility as well. If the smart contract is unpopular for some reason, the funds involved — publicly visible on the blockchain — are tainted.

As smart contracts become more complex, they can even become a security risk. Alternative software implementations might, for example, interpret details of contracts slightly differently, making it harder to keep all nodes on the network in consensus. And potential bugs in these smart contracts are public as well, which increases the chance of hacks.

But Poelstra, among others, thinks that many of these problems can be solved by actually moving the bulk of contracts off of the blockchain. Instead of having all nodes on the network calculate the entire smart contract, only the parties involved with the contract should perform this function.

The trick is to ensure that the rest of the network does still correctly enforce the outcome of the contract: The payment must only be made if the required conditions are met.

Schnorr
Poelstra originally began researching “Scriptless Scripts” (a phrase he also coined himself) in the context of the Mimblewimble protocol. This stripped down version of Bitcoin offers more privacy and better scalability but does not support script: the bits of code embedded in Bitcoin transactions that allow for most basic smart contract features.

So, Poelstra figured out how to get the utility offered by scripts without actually requiring them on the blockchain: Scriptless Scripts.

The key to Scriptless Scripts is that (fairly) regular cryptographic signatures can indirectly reveal something that’s not part of the transaction that includes the signature. In other words, when someone signs to validate an ordinary Bitcoin transaction, it holds that a smart contract that is not hosted on the blockchain still executes faithfully.

This is made possible with Schnorr signatures. These types of signatures are not yet implemented on the Bitcoin protocol, but it is possible that they could be deployed within a year or so from now.

Schnorr signatures allow for signature aggregation; several signatures can be mathematically combined into a single signature. And, importantly for this use case, this math is “linear.” This basically means it’s possible to perform relatively straightforward but very expressive math on these signatures.

Oversimplified, it works something like this:

Private keys and signatures are, of course, really just numbers, where the latter is derived from the former. Since this is a simplified example, let’s say one private key looks like 10, and half of the Schnorr signature derived from that private key looks like 10000. And the other private key looks like 15, with the second half of the Schnorr signature looking like 15000. In this simplified example, the Schnorr signature would then look like 25000 (or 10000 + 15000).

And since both halves of the signature are just numbers, it’s possible to perform math between them. For instance, in this simplified example, the difference between these halves is 5000 (or 15000 – 10000).

While the reality is more complex, Schnorr’s linearity allows for several of these kinds of math “tricks.”

The Smart Contract
Now let’s say that a streamer wants to listen to a song by an artist. The artist has the right to this song, and it will play for the streamer if (and only if) the artist's signature is provided to a server where the song is hosted. Since we’re simplifying, let’s say that this “song signature” looks like 7000. The streamer is willing to pay the artist one bitcoin for this song signature, to listen to the song. (He wants to listen to the song really badly.)

In this simplified example, the streamer and the artist can automate this trade by doing two things. First, they create a fairly normal Bitcoin transaction that sends one bitcoin from the streamer to the artist, if the streamer and the artist both provide their half of a Schnorr signature to create a full Schnorr signature. (In reality, this step requires some extra safety precautions to ensure no one loses money, but it is relatively simple.)

The next step is where it gets a bit more complex.

The artist knows what her half of the Schnorr signature looks like; since we’re simplifying, let’s say it looks like 8000. And she knows what her song signature looks like: 7000. As such, she can calculate the difference between these two: 1000. This is called the adaptor signature. The artist then hands this adaptor signature — 1000 — to the streamer.

Here’s where the cryptographic magic happens.

By modifying the ordinary signature verification method, the streamer can actually verify that the adaptor signature he just received (1000) is indeed the difference between the artist's half Schnorr signature and her song signature — even though the streamer does not have access to either signature yet. (And thanks to cryptographic tricks called “zero-knowledge proofs,” something like this can actually be done in a surprisingly broad range of scenarios, not just in signatures as this example portrays.)

Now, having verified that the adaptor signature (1000) checks out, the streamer can, in turn, give his half of the Schnorr signature to the artist because once the artist uses the streamer’s half to create a full signature and broadcasts this over the Bitcoin network, she automatically reveals her half of the Schnorr signature (8000) to the streamer as well.

Using the artist’s half of the Schnorr signature, the streamer can now subtract the adaptive signature: 1000. By subtracting the adaptive signature from the artist’s half Schnorr signature (8000 – 1000) the streamer indeed learns the artist’s “song signature”: 7000. And now he can listen to the song.

In other words, by broadcasting the transaction that pays her one bitcoin, the artist automatically sells the streamer the signature: a smart contract.

From the perspective of the blockchain — that is, the rest of the world — the transaction is quite regular. Nothing about the smart contract, other than the “settlement transaction,”  is ever recorded on the blockchain. No one will ever know that an underlying contract was executed — never mind what song the streamer listened to — and the contract-related data never needs to be calculated or stored by anyone other than the parties involved.

2017/11/27,This New Scaling Layer Could Make Payment Channels Ten Times More Effective,"There is no disputing the fact that the Bitcoin network has scalability problems. Micropayment channels are a solution to increase the transaction rate and speed. Yet, this is not the golden solution … This micropayments solution needs a fixed amount of funds to be locked into each channel’s multisignature wallet and requires a transaction for each channel creation and closure. This hinders the Blockchain network from upscaling to a global payment system because Bitcoin’s capacity is limited.

A recently published research paper by a university in Zurich suggests implementing a new layer in between the blockchain and payment channels that enables off-blockchain channel funding to reduce stress on the Bitcoin blockchain.

What Are Micropayment Channels?
The paper mentions two challenges: “Micropayment channel networks create new problems, which have not been solved in the original papers. We identify two main challenges — the blockchain capacity and locked-in funds.”

Before we go any further into this proposed solution, it is essential to understand the concept of micropayment channels. Bitcoin’s blockchain network doesn’t allow you to send many micropayments of tiny amounts of bitcoin. Bitcoin’s block weight limit caps this at less than 10 transactions per second, on average.

Payment channels let users lock up a fixed amount of funds in a multisignature wallet controlled by the client and receiver. A channel can be opened by sending a transaction to the blockchain. Next, an unlimited amount of payments can be made between the client and receiver. These payments are performed off-chain and only exist between both participants.

Once a channel is closed, a final transaction containing end balances will be sent out to the Bitcoin network. This is the base implementation of micropayment channels; a more evolved implementation is the lightning network, which allows bidirectional payment channels.

Reducing many hundreds, thousands or even more transactions to just two transactions per channel are a drastic improvement. Still, it is not enough for bringing the Bitcoin network to the level of a world-wide payment system. A channel can only exist between two participants. So, if each person in a group of 20 wants to open five channels, this will require a lot of transactions — 200 to be exact. Besides that, there is no solution for when the amount of locked funds is exceeded for a specific channel.

Proposed Solution
The paper tells us about a new layer: “We introduce a new layer between the blockchain and the payment network, giving a three layered system ... The new second layer consists of multi-party micropayment channels we call channel factories, which can quickly fund regular two party channels.”

The paper suggest a three-layered system in which the first and third layers already exist. The first layer locks the funds, and the third layer performs the actual transfers of currencies. The new second layer can be seen as a channel factory. It is responsible for creating multi-party micropayment channels and quickly refunding wallets when they are almost depleted. The paper calculated a savings of up to 90 percent for a group of 20 nodes with 100 channels in between them.

Instead of sending a blockchain transaction for each channel creation or closure, the paper suggests a system where just one transaction is needed to open multiple channels without further blockchain contact. Funds are locked into a shared wallet between a group of nodes instead of a specific channel. Furthermore, funds can be moved between groups with just an attached message with further details such as a receiver address. All of this happens off-blockchain.

The only addressed risk is that a user within a group can close the channel factory: the second layer. This induces a higher mining fee because more blockchain space is used. While this is not a big risk — a user won’t gain personal advantage by doing so — it does limit the usefulness of large groups.

Next, it is possible that the receiver doesn’t sign a transaction. The paper introduces the use of either timelocks or punishments for dishonest parties. They will focus on timelocks because they think it performs much better. After a timelock has elapsed, the current status of the channel will be broadcasted to the blockchain and the channel will be closed; no punishment is applied.

There is no risk in securing the funds. The multisignature wallet has a many-to-many constraint containing all signatures of the involved actors. Funds can only be spent when all actors have signed the transaction, so no one can be deprived of funds without signing for it themselves.",Technical,0.5256
2017/12/6,Developers Release Lightning Protocol 1.0; Perform Successful Interoperability Tests,"Blockchain developers ACINQ, Blockstream and Lightning Labs, are announcing the 1.0 release of the Lightning protocol and the world’s first Lightning test payments on the Bitcoin mainnet across all three implementations. These are considered to be important steps toward the standardization of the Lightning Network’s second-level, off-chain payment layer. The three teams, and others in the Bitcoin community, developed the Lightning specification through an open, collaborative process.

""Interoperability is key to making Lightning a success. We have worked for over a year to design a specification so that we and other developers can write implementations that talk to each other,” Elizabeth Stark, CEO of Lightning Labs, told Bitcoin Magazine. “This ensures that no matter which implementation a user is using, they will be connected to one Lightning Network.”

“It's the culmination of a year's work on the protocol specification, and the tests show that we have built a solid protocol that delivers on the promises of high scalability, increased privacy, and faster payments,"" Christian Decker, a Blockstream infrastructure tech engineer, told Bitcoin Magazine.

In parallel with protocol development work focused on interoperability and cross-compatibility, each of the three teams also developed specific Lightning implementations: ACINQ developed eclair, Blockstream developed c-lightning, and Lightning Labs developed lnd.

In a first test, the coffee shop Starblocks, a sample eclair application, accepted an incoming payment in bitcoin from a customer paying with the lnd Lightning app, routed through c-lightning.

In a second test, the developers made a payment from eclair to yalls.org, a sample lnd application, routed through c-lightning.

“This highlights another anticipated use case for Lightning: the ability to send instant, small value payments,” noted the three companies. The tests used nodes distributed around the world, including Asia, Europe, South America and North America.

It seems plausible that these and other interoperable Lightning Network implementations could be, one day, operational on the Bitcoin blockchain, but the developers are cautious about committing to a specific timeline.

“Our next steps are to continue testing and work as quickly as we can toward a mainnet beta, where users will be able to use small amounts on the Bitcoin mainnet,” Stark told Bitcoin Magazine.

Decker’s focus will be on the completion of the clients and individual releases “as quickly and safely as possible.” He emphasized that taking a patient approach and focusing on security is key. ""We don't make any promises besides. We do not release immature software out of respect for our user's funds.""

The Lightning Network is an overlay network built on top of an existing blockchain, in this case the Bitcoin blockchain. Similar to how the internet is built in layers, Lightning Network implementations create a new off-chain, high-throughput layer to channel near-instant payments. Interoperability will enable a single Lightning Network where payments are seamlessly routed without being isolated or incompatible.

Limited scalability is one of the main problems plaguing current Bitcoin technology. In fact, the current Bitcoin blockchain can only process a few transactions per second, far below the thousands of transactions per second processed by the main credit card payment networks. Therefore, following the first Bitcoin Lightning Network white paper, published in February 2015, developers have been working on Lightning Network implementations to enable bitcoin scalability, efficient micropayments and near-instant transactions.

This page on Github shows the latest integration test results for the three Lightning implementations.

“As we move towards a final 1.0 version of the specification, we invite the broader community to provide peer review and feedback,” concludes the announcement. “We look forward to continue working together to build the future of Layer 2 scalability technology.”

2017/12/19,This Lightning Network Designer Is Re-Inventing Bitcoin Smart Contracts,"Bitcoin is usually not considered the blockchain best suited for self-executing conditional payments, better known as smart contracts. While it does support basic programmability to enable features like time locks and multi-signature (multisig) schemes, competing projects like Ethereum, Ethereum Classic or Qtum are often expected to better support more advanced applications.

However, a new wave of research is increasingly questioning this assumption. For example, Scriptless Scripts, a project spearheaded by Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra, cleverly utilizes the magic of cryptography to move smart contracts off-chain, while leveraging Bitcoin’s security, but without requiring extensive smart-contract support on the Bitcoin protocol itself.

Along similar conceptual lines, Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) could deploy another class of smart contracts on top of Bitcoin. A project by one of the authors of the original Lightning Network white paper, Tadge Dryja, and recently presented at Scaling Bitcoin Stanford, DLCs could realize blockchain-enforced insurance companies, futures contracts, dollar-pegged coins and much more.

Here’s how that works.

Bets
Many types of smart contracts essentially boil down to “bets.”

Let’s say, for example, that someone wants to insure himself against being unable to travel due to a potential pilot strike. That person can then “bet” there will be a strike. If there is no strike, the “bet” is lost as if it were an insurance down payment. If there is a strike, on the other hand, the “bet” is won, like an insurance payout.

As a more interesting example perhaps, people can also bet on the price of BTC relative to the US dollar: a futures market. If someone bets that the BTC price will go down, and the BTC price does go down, he “wins” more BTC; if the BTC price goes up, he “loses” some BTC. Interestingly, this can be structured to ensure that the person entering into these “bets” is practically guaranteed to end up with the same USD value in BTC regardless of what happens. This can, in turn, be used to realize a “stablecoin” with fixed USD value on Bitcoin's blockchain. (It should be noted that there are extreme examples where this doesn’t hold up, like a scenario where Bitcoin fails completely and BTC drops to zero dollars — but, in most cases, it works.)

However, while these types of smart contracts are interesting, they cannot be executed based on blockchain-based data alone. A blockchain cannot tell whether pilots are striking, nor what the USD/BTC exchange rate is. This requires data input from outside of the blockchain, and this is where “oracles” come in.

Oracles
Oracles are essentially trusted sources of information; they provide data that cannot itself be “read” by a blockchain. This data can be inserted into a smart contract, which will then execute based on the oracle’s input.

Since the types of smart contracts described above need to rely on such external data sources anyway, it makes sense to leverage the trust in oracles in order to simplify a smart contract. Instead of more complex solutions, oracles can, for example, be “plugged into” a relatively basic multisig scheme.

As a simple example, let’s say that next summer Alice and Bob want to bet a bitcoin on the FIFA World Cup final between Argentina and Brazil. Alice thinks Argentina will win; Bob thinks Brazil will. To make this bet blockchain-enforceable, Alice and Bob both send one bitcoin to a multisig address that requires two of three signatures to spend the coins. One of these three keys is held by Alice, another key is held by Bob and the third key is held by the oracle.

If Argentina wins, Alice and Bob should both sign a transaction from this address that sends both bitcoins to Alice. Since this requires only two signatures, Alice and Bob’s signatures suffice, and the oracle never comes into play. (Needless to say, if Brazil wins it’s the other way around: Alice and Bob sign a transaction sending both coins to Bob.)

A problem arises only when the losing party — Bob — refuses to sign the transaction. It’s in this scenario that the oracle would use its third key to help Alice claim the two bitcoins. Importantly, exactly because this is an option, Bob really has no reason not to sign. (This is even more true if Alice and Bob put up some collateral so Bob gets refunded some of his BTC if he signs.)

Ideally, the oracle’s signature should hardly ever be needed at all; Alice and Bob can complete the bet on their own.

Still, the basic multisig and oracle solution has its weaknesses. For example, the oracle would probably have to be involved with setting up the bet; or at least it should be available to act as a sort of judge whenever needed. This means that the oracle could potentially be corrupted, for example, if Bob offers the oracle a share of the coins if they collude to steal both. And Alice and Bob also have no privacy from the oracle: the oracle will know exactly what they are betting on and how much they are betting. Meanwhile, the rest of the world can tell that Alice and Bob used an oracle for their bet (and, therefore, that it was a bet).

These are the problems that Discreet Log Contracts could solve. They maintain the benefits of the straightforward multisig and oracle solution — but eliminate most of its weaknesses.

Payment Channels
As mentioned, Dryja, who is currently working for MIT Media Lab’s Digital Currency Initiative, is one of the authors of the lightning network white paper. His DLC project is based on a similar concept.

A key idea behind the lightning network is that two people can open a payment channel, allowing them to transact with each other. Such a payment channel utilizes Bitcoin’s basic programmability (like time locks and multisig addresses) and combines it with some clever tricks to commit transactions to other transactions, all without broadcasting them to the network unless needed.

Over time, as the people in the channel transact with each other, these payment channels are updated with new balances or “channel states.” Either party can then “drop” the latest channel state on the blockchain at any time and claim their balance whenever they want to. And importantly — this is where Bitcoin’s basic programmability is leveraged — both parties can only safely broadcast the latest channel state. If they try to cheat by broadcasting an earlier channel state, their counterparty can actually claim every single coin in the channel.

DLCs works similarly. But where a lightning network payment channel only lets the parties involved broadcast the most recent channel state, DLCs limit them to broadcasting only the channel state reflecting the correct outcome of a bet.

This is where the oracle comes in — but this time combined with some fancy math tricks.

The Oracle Signature
As opposed to 2-of-3 multisig schemes where oracles act a bit like judges, oracles in DLCs more closely resemble broadcasters. For our World Cup bet, it would make sense that the oracle is a sports-betting service, a football news website, perhaps the FIFA or another entity that broadcasts the winner anyway and that is reasonably trusted not to lie about it.

Let’s say the oracle in this case is a sports-betting service that regularly publishes the score and winner of the World Cup final on their website. To enable a DLC, the same sports-betting service only needs to add a minor additional step.

Basically, this “broadcast oracle” has a public key and a private key. (A private key is really just a randomly generated number, while the public key is a seemingly random number derived from that private key.) This public key is published somewhere, most likely on the betting service’s website for anyone to find. The private key is, of course, kept private: This can be used by the oracle to sign a message. (Such a signature, too, is a seemingly random number but is derived from the private key in combination with the message.)

The possible outcomes of the bet are known as well: either Argentina wins the World Cup final or Brazil wins. The sports-betting service, therefore, announces that it will broadcast one of two very specific messages: “Argentina won” or “Brazil won.”

Now, what’s interesting about public key cryptography is that the sports-betting service’s public key can be used to figure out what a signature of the message — “Argentina won” or “Brazil won” — will mathematically “look like.” (“Look like,” in this case, doesn’t mean that Alice and Bob can produce the signature themselves, but they can calculate certain mathematical properties that it will have.)

Because Alice and Bob can calculate what the potential oracle signatures will “look like,” they can use it in their DLC.

The Discreet Log Contract
First, before the World Cup final, Alice and Bob pay one bitcoin to a “funding transaction.” From this funding transaction, several potential transactions are constructed — but these are not yet broadcast over the network.

Here’s where the cryptography gets a bit complex.

What the sports-betting service signatures “look like” is cleverly embedded in these several potential transactions, where each potential signature enables a different transaction. (Specifically, and somewhat unconventionally, what the signatures “look like” is used as public keys in key-pairs for the different transactions.)

In other words, knowing what the oracle’s potential signatures will “look like,” Alice and Bob can construct their payment channels such that the two different potential signatures can be used to validate two different channel states: one where Alice gets two bitcoins and one where Bob gets them.

Then, the actual oracle signature, which is published after the World Cup final is played, is used as private key to validate the winning transaction — and only the winning transaction. If the sports-betting service broadcasts a signature for “Argentina won,” Alice can take this signature, use it as a private key (in combination with her own private key) and claim the two bitcoins from the channel. If the oracle signs a message for “Brazil won,” Bob can. Meanwhile, if either tries to claim the bitcoins without the oracle signature, they will fail, and their counterparty can instead claim both coins.

Further, like lightning network payment channels, the outcome of the bet — two bitcoins for Alice if Argentina wins — can now also be broadcast by Alice and Bob as a fairly regular multisig transaction from the funding transaction. And indeed, exactly because Alice can enforce the outcome with the oracle signature anyway, there is little reason for Bob not to cooperate.

As a result, the “bet” is fully blockchain-enforced through the sports-betting service’s signature, while this service doesn’t need to do anything for this specific bet; it doesn’t even need to know it ever took place.

And, notably, while this bet is relatively simple (either Argentina wins or Brazil wins), in reality DLCs could allow for far more complex scenarios. Exactly because only a fairly regular multisig transaction is broadcasted in the end, it doesn’t really matter if a “bet” has two, 200, or 200,000 potential outcomes.",Technical,0.4019
2017/12/20,How Bulletproofs Could Make Bitcoin Privacy Less Costly,"Bulletproofs, presented in a paper titled “Bulletproofs: Short Proofs for Confidential Transactions and More,” describe a new zero-knowledge proof system. The proposal uses on-chain scaling for privacy and suggests a new, faster and more compact way to verify privacy-enhancing Confidential Transactions (CTs). Specifically, Bulletproofs can decrease the size of these verifications for these types of transactions drastically. Furthermore, the authors of the paper — Stanford University’s Applied Cryptography Group, overseen by professor Dan Boneh — have already managed to create a practical implementation for Bulletproofs.

This is how it works.

Currently, all transaction information — such as wallet addresses and especially the sent amount of bitcoins — are visible on the Bitcoin blockchain. This affects the privacy of all users. If we wish to pay wages via the Bitcoin network, for example, this means that every salary will be visible on the blockchain network. This, in turn, could mean that someone (like your landlord) could look up how much money you’re making to try and increase your rent accordingly.

Confidential Transactions are much needed to bring any type of blockchain to a higher level of privacy. Confidential Transactions combine and utilize several cryptographic tricks so that only the sender and the receiver of a transaction are aware of the amount transacted. These cryptographic tricks let users obfuscate the amounts they are transacting while still allowing onlookers to perform math on the obfuscated amounts. Basically, anyone can still check that the sum of sent bitcoins is greater than the sum of received bitcoins.

Confidential Transactions are realized with “zero-knowledge proofs.” These proofs are best described as a method for proving to another party that a Confidential Transaction is valid without conveying any information about the Confidential Transaction itself.

However, as stated in the Bulletproofs paper: “Current proposals for CT zero-knowledge proofs have either been prohibitively large or required a trusted setup. Neither is desirable.”

First of all, if we have to prove multiple range proofs, which is the case for multisignature transactions, the complexity and size will scale in a linear fashion. For example, if the size of a single proof is 2 kB, two proofs are 4 kB, three proofs are 6 kB and so on.

Additionally, zero-knowledge proofs typically require a trusted setup: they must be initialized by some trusted authority. However, the security properties of the Bitcoin system don’t apply to that authority because in practice it means that the authority could produce fake “proofs.” These fake proofs could lead to uncontrolled and undetectable inflation.

Bulletproofs could solve these problems.

According to the paper, “In any distributed system where proofs are transmitted over a network or stored for a long time, short proofs reduce overall cost.”

Bulletproofs are claimed to be able to reduce the cryptographic proof significantly: from 8 kB to 734 bytes, though this depends on what the transaction looks like. Moreover, when dealing with multiple proofs, the size increases with just a few percent instead of this linear scaling. And in addition, Bulletproofs do not require a trusted setup.

Andrew Poelstra, contributor to the research paper and mathematician at Blockstream, believes that Bulletproofs are very practical: “We have already implemented a first version in the Bitcoin crypto library libsec256k1, which can verify proofs three and a half times faster than the verifier for the classic rangeproofs. It is a drop-in replacement for classic rangeproofs that does not affect other aspects of the system and is therefore very easy to integrate.”

Until now, Confidential Transactions were just a theoretical concept because they were so heavy to implement. With Bulletproofs, the implementation of Confidential Transactions on Bitcoin suddenly becomes more likely.",Technical,-0.0276
2017/12/29,Ivy Playground for Bitcoin: Experimenting With the Future of Bitcoin Smart Contracts,"Blockchain developer Chain is releasing an open-source compiler and development environment for writing Bitcoin smart contracts using Ivy, a smart contract language developed in-house.

Chain is best known for the open-source Chain protocol and Chain Core, an enterprise blockchain infrastructure that facilitates financial transactions on scalable, private blockchain networks. An open-source developer edition of Chain Core is available to developers, with a testnet operated by Chain. Ivy was developed at Chain as a smart contract language for Chain Core. With Ivy for Bitcoin, which compiles to Bitcoin Script, Chain wants to make it easier for average programmers to write smart contracts for the public Bitcoin network.

By design, Bitcoin doesn’t include a Turing-complete programming language for smart contracts of arbitrary complexity. But this doesn’t mean that Bitcoin doesn’t support smart contracts. In fact, the simple, low-level, primitive operations included in Bitcoin’s native scripting language (Bitcoin Script) can be exploited to write smart contracts of significant complexity. “Bitcoin Script does provide a set of useful primitives — signature checks, hash computations, and absolute and relative timelocks  — and the freedom to combine those primitives,” notes the Chain news release.

However, Bitcoin Script is not being fully used by software developers, which according to Chain is due to “the relative difficulty of reading and writing Bitcoin Script programs, and of creating and using addresses from those programs.” In fact, Bitcoin Script is a very low-level, assembly-like language, which doesn’t offer the readability and ease of use of high-level programming languages. Therefore, most Bitcoin programmers limit themselves to simple applications, without pushing Bitcoin Script to its limits.

The Chain developers want to change that with Ivy, a higher-level language that allows developers to create custom, SegWit-compatible Bitcoin addresses that enforce arbitrary combinations of conditions supported by the Bitcoin protocol, including signature checks, hash commitments and timelocks.

Earlier this year, Chain released Ivy Playground, a tool for designing, drafting and testing smart contracts on a Chain Core blockchain network with Ivy. Now, Chain is making Ivy available to Bitcoin developers and releasing Ivy Playground for Bitcoin, which allows developers to design, create and spend simulated Bitcoin contracts. The playground includes preloaded smart contract templates for Bitcoin and developer documentation.

A disclaimer states that Ivy is relatively untested prototype software and should be used for educational and research purposes only. “Do not attempt to use Ivy to control real Bitcoins,” warns the front-page document.

Besides Chain, other developers are realizing that Bitcoin needs more sophisticated smart contracts and user-friendly programming environments for smart contracts. Recently, blockchain developer Blockstream introduced Simplicity, a new programming language for blockchain-based smart contracts, intended for inclusion in Blockstream’s sidechains and eventually in Bitcoin. Lead developer Russell O’Connor said that “after extensive vetting,” Simplicity support could be considered for inclusion in one of the next releases of Bitcoin.

In the Blockstream announcement, O’Connor noted that Ivy’s programming language development efforts may be suitable for being compiled to Simplicity. But it now appears that Ivy’s progress toward these more sophisticated Bitcoin smart contracts is advancing faster than some might have expected.",Technical,0.4019
2018/1/2,Keep an Eye Out for These Bitcoin Tech Trends in 2018,"In many ways, 2017 was Bitcoin’s best year yet. Most obviously, increased adoption made the pioneering cryptocurrency’s exchange rate skyrocket from under $1000 to well over 10 times that value.

But from a tech perspective, things seem to be just getting started: 2018 promises to be the year that a number of highly anticipated projects are either launched or adopted.

Here’s a brief overview of some of the most promising upcoming technological developments to keep an eye on in the new year.

segwit inter.jpg

Cheaper Transactions with Segregated Witness and a New Address Format
Segregated Witness (SegWit) was one of Bitcoin’s biggest — if not the biggest — protocol upgrade to date. Activated in August 2017, it fixed the long-standing malleability bug, in turn better enabling second-layer protocols. Additionally, SegWit replaced Bitcoin’s block size limit with a block weight limit, allowing for increased transactions throughout the network, thereby lowering fees per transaction.

However, adoption of the upgrade has been off to a relatively slow start. While some wallets and services are utilizing the added block space offered by SegWit, many others are not yet doing so. This means that, while Bitcoin is technically capable of supporting between two and four megabytes worth of transactions per ten minutes, it barely exceeds 1.1 megabytes.

This is set to change in 2018.

For one, the Bitcoin Core wallet interface will allow users to accept and send SegWit transactions. Bitcoin Core 0.16, scheduled for May 2018 (though this may be moved forward), will most likely realize this through a new address format known as “bech32,” which also has some technical advantages that limit risks and mistakes (for example, those caused by typos).

“To spend coins from the P2SH format currently used for SegWit, users need to reveal a redeem script in the transaction,” Bitcoin Core and Blockstream developer Dr. Pieter Wuille, who also co-designed the bech32 address format, told Bitcoin Magazine.

“With native SegWit outputs this is no longer necessary, which means transactions take up less data. Recipients of SegWit transactions will be able to spend these coins at a lower cost.”

Perhaps even more importantly, several major Bitcoin services — like Coinbase — plan to upgrade to SegWit in 2018 as well. Since such services account for a large chunk of all transactions on the Bitcoin network, this could significantly decrease network congestion, thereby decreasing average transaction fees and confirmation times, even for those who do not use these services.

lightning2018.jpg

The Lightning Network Rolling Out on Bitcoin’s Mainnet
While further SegWit adoption should provide immediate relief of fee pressure and confirmation times, truly meaningful long-term scalability will likely be achieved with second-layer solutions built on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain.

One of the most highly anticipated solutions in this regard — especially for lower value transactions — is the lightning network. This overlay network, first proposed by Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja in 2015, promises to enable near-free transactions and instant confirmations, all while leveraging Bitcoin’s security.

The solution has been under active development for about two years now, with major efforts by ACINQ, Blockstream and Lightning Labs. Progress on the scaling layer has been significant all throughout 2017, with early software releases of different but compatible software implementations, useable wallets interfaces and test transactions happening both on Bitcoin’s testnet and even on Bitcoin’s mainnet on a regular basis now.

“I'd say we have solved the main technical problems and have a relatively good idea on how to improve on the current system,” Christian Decker, lightning developer at Blockstream, told Bitcoin Magazine. “One last hurdle that's worth mentioning is the network topology: We'd like to steer the network formation to be as decentralized as possible.”

Given the current state of development, adoption of the lightning network should only increase throughout 2018 — not just among developers, but increasingly among end users as well.

“Integration and testing will be the next major step forward,” Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark agreed, noting: “Some exchanges and wallets are already working on it.”

privacy2018.jpg

Increased Privacy Through TumbleBit and ZeroLink
While it is sometimes misrepresented as such, Bitcoin is not really private right now. All transactions are included in the public blockchain for anyone to see, and transaction data analysis can reveal a lot about who owns what, who transacts with whom and more. While there are solutions available to increase privacy right now — like straightforward bitcoin mixers — these usually have significant drawbacks: They often require trusted parties or have privacy leaks.

This situation could be improved significantly in 2018. Two of the most promising projects in this domain — TumbleBit and ZeroLink — are both getting close to mainnet deployment.

TumbleBit was first proposed in 2016 by a group of researchers led by Ethan Heilman. It is essentially a coin-mixing protocol that uses a tumbler to create payment channels from all participants to all participants in a single mixing session. Everyone effectively receives different bitcoins than what they started with, breaking the trail of ownership for all. And importantly, TumbleBit utilizes clever cryptographic tricks to ensure that the tumbler can’t establish a link between users either.

An initial implementation of the TumbleBit protocol was coded by NBitcoin developer Nicolas Dorier in early 2017. His work was picked up by Ádám Ficsór as well as other developers, and blockchain platform Stratis announced it would implement the technology in its upcoming Breeze wallet, which also supports Bitcoin, by March 2018. Recently, in mid- December of 2017, Stratis released TumbleBit integration in this wallet in beta.

The other promising solution, ZeroLink, is an older concept: it was first proposed (not under the same name) by Bitcoin Core contributor and Blockstream CTO Gregory Maxwell, back in 2013. Not unlike TumbleBit, ZeroLink utilizes a central server to connect all users but without being able to link their transactions. As opposed to TumbleBit, however, it creates a single (CoinJoin) transaction between all participants, which makes the solution significantly cheaper.

This idea seemed to have been forgotten for some years until Ficsór (indeed, the same Ficsór that worked on TumbleBit) rediscovered it earlier this year. He switched his efforts from TumbleBit to a new ZeroLink project and has since finished an initial ZeroLink implementation.

Ficsór recently ran some tests with his ZeroLink implementation, and while results showed that his implementation needs improvement, Ficsór considers it likely that it will be properly usable within months.

“I could throw it out in the open right now and let people mix,” he told Bitcoin Magazine. ""There is no risk of money loss at any point during the mix, and many mixing rounds were executing correctly. It is just some users would encounter some bugs I am not comfortable with fixing on the fly.”

sidechain2018.jpg

More Sidechains, More Adoption
Sidechains are alternative blockchains but with coins pegged one-to-one to specific bitcoins. This allows users to effectively “move” bitcoins to chains that operate under entirely different rules and means that Bitcoin and all its sidechains only use the “original” 21 million coins embedded in the Bitcoin protocol. A sidechain could then, for example, allow for faster confirmations, or more privacy, or extended smart contract capabilities, or just about anything else that altcoins are used for today.

The concept was first proposed by Blockstream CEO Dr. Adam Back and others back in 2014; it formed the basis around which Blockstream was first founded. Blockstream itself also launched the Liquid sidechain, which allows for instant transactions between — in particular — Bitcoin exchanges. Liquid is currently still in beta but could see its 1.0 release in 2018.

Another highly anticipated sidechain that has been in development for some time is RSK. RSK is set to enable support of Turing-complete smart contracts, hence bringing the flexibility of Ethereum to Bitcoin. RSK is currently in closed beta, with RSK Labs cofounder Sergio Demian Lerner suggesting a public release could follow soon.

Further, Bloq scientist Paul Sztorc recently finished a rough implementation of his drivechain project. Where both Liquid and RSK for now apply a “federated” model, where the sidechain is secured by a group of semi-trusted “gatekeepers,” drivechains would be secured by bitcoin miners.

If drivechains are deployed in 2018, the first iteration of such a sidechain could well be “Bitcoin Extended:” essentially a “big block"" version of Bitcoin to allow for more transaction throughput. That said, reception of the proposal on the Bitcoin development mailing list and within Bitcoin’s development community has been mixed so far. Since drivechains do need a soft-fork protocol upgrade, the contention does make the future of drivechains a bit more uncertain.

“Miners could activate drivechains tomorrow, but they often outsource their understanding of ‘what software is good’,” Sztorc told Bitcoin Magazine. “So they'll either have to decide for themselves that it is good, or it would have to make it into a Bitcoin release.”

schnorr2018.jpg

A Schnorr Signatures Proposal
Schnorr signatures, named after its inventor Claus-Peter Schnorr, are considered by many cryptographers to be the best type cryptographic signatures in the field. They offer a strong level of correctness, do not suffer from malleability, are relatively fast to verify and enable useful features, thanks to their mathematical properties. Now, with the activation of Segregated Witness, it could be relatively easy to implement Schnorr signatures on the Bitcoin protocol.

Perhaps the biggest advantage of the Schnorr signature algorithm is that multiple signatures can be aggregated into a single signature. In the context of Bitcoin, this means that one signature can prove ownership of multiple Bitcoin addresses (really, “inputs”). Since many transactions send coins from multiple inputs, having to include only one signature per transaction should significantly benefit Bitcoin’s scalability. Analysis based on historical transactions suggest it would save an average of 25 percent per transaction, which would increase Bitcoin’s maximum transaction capacity by about 33 percent.

Further on, Schnorr signatures could enable even more. For example, with Schnorr, it should also be possible to aggregate different signatures from a multi-signature transaction, which require multiple signatures to spend the same input. This could, in turn, make CoinJoin a cheaper alternative to regular transactions for participants, thereby incentivizing a more private-use Bitcoin. Eventually the mathematical properties of Schnorr signatures could even enable more advanced applications, such as smart contracts utilizing “Scriptless Scripts.”

Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Wuille confirmed that there will probably be a concrete Bitcoin Improvement Proposal for Schnorr signatures in 2018.

“We might, as a first step, propose an upgrade to support Schnorr signatures without aggregation,” he said. “This would be a bit more straightforward to implement and already offers benefits. Then a proposal to add aggregation would follow later.”

Whether Schnorr signatures will already be adopted and used on Bitcoin’s mainnet is harder to predict. It will require a soft fork protocol upgrade, and much depends on the peer review and testing process.",Technical,0.9995
2018/1/5,Wallet Developers Express Security Concerns Over BitPay’s Payment Protocol Policy,"On December 14, 2017, BitPay announced a first step toward enforcing the payment protocol: All orders of the BitPay Card will require payments from Payment Protocol-compatible wallets, such as BitPay’s own wallet and a few others. This announcement came after an initial notice in November 2017, when BitPay first announced that BitPay invoices would soon require payments from wallets compatible with the Bitcoin Payment Protocol.

BitPay’s move has since been met with resistance by some wallet developers that don’t support the Bitcoin Payment Protocol; some are suggesting that BitPay is abusing its leading position in the payment processing space and putting user security at risk.

“We absolutely do not support BitPay in aggressively using their dominant position of market share to bully wallet providers into supporting their business plans or bully users into a system that degrades their privacy and the fungibility of bitcoin as a whole,” stated bitcoin wallet Samourai in its blog post of January 2, 2018.

The Bitcoin Payment Protocol (BIP70), proposed by Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn in 2013, describes a protocol for communication between a merchant and their customer, “enabling both a better customer experience and better security against man-in-the-middle attacks on the payment process.” A detailed explanation of the details of the payment protocol, written by Mike Hearn in Q/A format, is available on the Bitcoin forum.

According to BitPay, the Payment Protocol will reduce user error in bitcoin payments, such as payments sent to a wrong address or with a transaction fee that is too low for fast processing by the Bitcoin network.

“We answer thousands of customer support requests every month, and we see first-hand how these problems affect BitPay merchants and their customers,” notes BitPay, adding that if two wallets both ""speak"" Payment Protocol, the correct receiving bitcoin address and the correct sending amount are locked in automatically by creating an SSL-secured connection to the true owner of the receiving bitcoin address. Instead of cryptic Bitcoin addresses, the protocol uses human readable identifiers, which are then mapped to Bitcoin addresses.

“Our next step will be requiring Payment Protocol payments for all BitPay Card loads,” stated BitPay. “From there, we will move to require Payment Protocol for all BitPay invoices ... We continue to work with other wallet providers in the Bitcoin ecosystem to advance adoption of the Bitcoin Payment Protocol. We're encouraged by the response we have received. Widespread adoption of Payment Protocol will immediately improve the bitcoin payment experience.”

According to a list provided on the BitPay website, Copay, Mycelium and Electrum wallets, along with Bitcoin Core, support Payment Protocol payments. “These true bitcoin wallets all already ‘speak’ Payment Protocol,” stated BitPay. “If you are using a non-Payment Protocol wallet or service to pay BitPay invoices, you will need to move your spending bitcoin to a wallet or service which can support Payment Protocol. We strongly recommend that you use a true bitcoin wallet for spending to avoid delayed transactions, but you will be able to use any service compatible with Payment Protocol.”

This list, however, is out-of-date. Bitcoin Magazine reached out to several other wallets to verify their status.

“Our currently released app Airbitz does support BIP70 and has since 2015,” Paul Puey, Co-Founder and CEO of AirBitz (recently rebranded as Edge), told Bitcoin Magazine. “Edge Wallet (currently in beta) will support BIP70 in a future production version.” BitPay currently lists Airbitz as not supporting BIP70.

Bread also has supported BIP70 since 2015, contrary to information supplied on BitPay’s list.

Security Concerns
One of the most outspoken opponents of this policy shift has been Samourai Wallet.

“We have to be very clear here,” Samourai stated bluntly in its recent blog post. “Samourai Wallet will not support BIP70 in our products, therefore, our wallet users will NOT be able to send bitcoin to QR codes generated by BitPay invoices, as they do not provide a valid Bitcoin address.”

According to Samourai, BIP70 “remains largely unadopted by the majority of wallet and service providers” due to many security and privacy concerns, including the required support of legacy public-key infrastructure features with known vulnerabilities, such as OpenSSL and Heartbleed.

Indeed, the recent revelations about Meltdown and Spectre have created additional security concerns among some critics.

“Meltdown/Spectre greatly increase the risk of keys being stolen from memory,” James Hilliard, developer and MyRig engineer, told Bitcoin Magazine, “since they are side-channel attacks that allow processes to spy on the memory other processes (wallet private keys generally have to go into memory at some point in order to sign the transaction).”

“We do share some of the concerns but do not feel as strongly as Samourai Wallet,” said Puey. “In the case of the acquisition of a payment QR code from a website, one is already trusting SSL public key infrastructure to know that a public address is from the owner. Adding BIP70 to that makes it no worse. However, if one is doing a peer-to-peer transaction between two wallets that are physically next to each other, there is no need to rely on an https server query to obtain a public address, and that process absolutely introduces more risk than necessary.”

Many bitcoin wallets, including Coinbase and Jaxx, don’t support BIP70 at the moment. Others, like Airbitz and its upcoming Edge, support BIP70 but less enthusiastically than BitPay.

Addison Cameron-Huff is President of Decentral, the company that develops the Jaxx wallet. Referring to BitPay’s statement that BIP70 does for Bitcoin what secured web-browsing (HTTPS) did for the internet, he told Bitcoin Magazine, “I think BitPay is overstating the case for BIP70. It’s also a bit misleading to refer to BIPs as ‘standards,’” adding that the “BIP” acronym stands for “Bitcoin Improvement Proposal,” not “Bitcoin Improvement Standard.”

“Not showing addresses is a big change in how people use Bitcoin, and, as of January 2018, I think it’s premature to force this change ecosystem-wide, but BitPay is only insisting upon this for people who want to use BitPay,” continued Cameron-Huff. “We’ll see over the coming months how this change affects their user base and whether alternative payment processing firms win marketshare (or don't). Ultimately, the cryptocurrency world is one in which the best products and proposals tend to win out in the market, and only time will tell whether this was a good decision for BitPay and more importantly: a good decision for the Bitcoin community.”

“We have had multiple conversations with BitPay and have expressed our concerns with the BIP70 protocol including unnecessary complications that do not truly solve the problems presented,” said Puey. “We feel that extensions to the BIP21 spec could have been implemented that would have achieved the same goals that BitPay desired without the added complications, centralization or SSL security implications.”

“While we intend to continue supporting BIP70 we do NOT recommend that providers use it or require it to receive payment and instead pursue extensions to BIP21 instead,” concluded Puey. “We have experienced a multitude of issues with BitPay's support of BIP70 including their own servers being unable to provide payment information through the provided payment URL causing wallets to fallback to BIP21-style payments if capable.”

Future Adoption
Bread wallet CMO Aaron Lasher told Bitcoin Magazine that while Bread already supports BIP70, the company has plans to “make it work with BitPay in an upcoming release.” He emphasized that it will be important to maintain the wallet’s core functionality and ensure that its high level of privacy remains.

“Bread is a consumer-focused wallet, so we support anything at face value that improves or simplifies the user experience, provided we are able to maintain sufficient privacy and financial control on behalf of our users.”

Similarly, Cameron-Huff explained that while Jaxx doesn’t currently support BIP70, if BIP70 becomes an actual widely adopted standard, then Jaxx will enable it for users.

“We will be keeping an eye on this change with BitPay and other large blockchain ecosystem organizations,” concluded Cameron-Huff. “We are always looking to improve Jaxx but also have to balance this with not forcing changes upon our users or implementing hasty changes that might cause a negative experience for our 600,000 users.”

A representative from the hardware wallet Ledger told Bitcoin Magazine, “We do not plan yet to support BIP70 directly in our wallet as it'd only make sense if we could offer an end-to-end support to the hardware wallet which is not doable yet, considering the complexity of this protocol.”

Ledger added that it might support it through a translating gateway later in the future while keeping users aware of the extra risks. Like Airbitz/Edge, the company expressed a preference for BIP21.

“Security wise, we also believe that BIP70 is not in a great state today (not supporting ECDSA certificates, duplicating standard PKI issues where users have to authenticate possible rogue certificates, possibly forcing public authentication cookies on users through specific outputs) and would appreciate if all payment providers could keep offering regular BIP21 URLs for interoperability.”

Update (January 6, 2016): GreenAddress wallet did not respond to our request for comment in time for inclusion in Friday's post. A representative has since emailed us this information:
""We have supported BIP70 for several years now. We share many of the same concerns that other wallet developers (including hardware wallets) have expressed.""",Technical,0.34
2018/1/18,"Blockstream Releases Lightning Charge, Launches Test E-Commerce Store","Following the release of the first Bitcoin Lightning Network white paper, published in February 2015, developers have been working on Lightning Network implementations to enhance the throughput and usability of the Bitcoin network. For an overview, see this three-part series on “Understanding the Lightning Network.”

In December 2017, lightning developers ACINQ, Blockstream and Lightning Labs, announced the 1.0 release of the Lightning protocol and the world’s first Lightning test payments on the Bitcoin mainnet across all three implementations. The standardization and deployment of the Lightning Network’s second-level, off-chain payment layer is expected to result in instant bitcoin transactions, improved scalability and lower fees, enabling fast and cheap micropayments.

Blockstream’s implementation of the Lightning spec, c-lightning, is a low-level technology designed to implement the Lightning spec without added complexity. At the same time, Blockstream realizes that developer tools are needed to unlock the power of Lightning for advanced applications, such as those that integrate with credit card companies and with existing online payment systems.

Blockstream is releasing the Lightning Charge complementary package for c-lightning to make it simpler to build sophisticated applications on top of c-lightning.

“Web developers will be able to work with c-lightning through their normal programming techniques, and they’ll also get expanded functionality such as currency conversion, invoice metadata, streaming payment updates and webhooks,” reads the Blockstream announcement. “Together, these additions make it easy for developers to use c-lightning to create their own, independent web-payment infrastructures.”

Lightning Charge is a micropayment processing system written in node.js. It exposes the functionality of c-lightning through its REST API, which can be accessed through JavaScript and PHP libraries, both of which have also been released through the Elements Project.

""Lightning Charge makes integration with the Lightning Network much simpler, since it bridges the needs of application developers and the underlying infrastructure, to provide a simple and extensible way to accept Lightning payments,"" Blockstream developer Christian Decker said in conversation with Bitcoin Magazine.

“Since the introduction of Lightning Charge, less than 48 hours ago, we have seen a dramatic interest in the Lightning Network, both on the user as well as the developer side,” Decker added. “We have gotten a lot of feedback, and the mainnet network has doubled in the number of participants.""

The desired effect of the Lightning Charge launch was to reach a wider audience, get early feedback from future users and to showcase what will be possible in a not-so-distant future, and I think we have achieved that goal.
Israeli entrepreneur Nadav Ivgi, founder of Bitrated, worked with Blockstream developers to create Lightning Charge. “Together with him we built this new code, or this immediate piece of software that provides this nicer to use interface,” said Decker.

“So far the development for Lightning has been mostly on the network side of things. It’s been very much this close-knit group of people that are building it and are trying to build the infrastructure. Infrastructure is nice to have. But if nobody can actually use it then it’s not worth much, right?”

To test Lightning Charge, Blockstream is launching the Blockstream Store, a working e-commerce site that allows users to make small purchases of stickers and t-shirts. “By offering an early demonstration of this cutting-edge technology, we hope to bring Lightning to life with real-world functionality, providing a way for you to test Lightning and become a part of the micropayment revolution,” states the Blockstream announcement.

The Blockstream Store, built on WordPress and WooCommerce, connects with Lightning Charge and c-lightning through a WooCommerce Lightning Gateway, which Blockstream also released as part of the Elements Project.

The only way to purchase the items in the Blockstream store is with a Lightning payment. A disclaimer warns that, although the products sold in the store are real, this store is for testing and demonstration purposes only.

“Lightning is still very new and contains known and unknown bugs,” reads the disclaimer, adding that users may lose funds.

""We believe this is an important step towards a full rollout of the network as a whole, however we’d like to remind users that the Lightning Network is still experimental and that testnet is to be preferred for testing before making the jump to mainnet,"" Decker told Bitcoin Magazine.",Technical,0.9862
2018/2/12,The Electrum Personal Server Will Give Users the Full Node Security They Need,"The Electrum Personal Server promises a resource-efficient, secure and private way to use bitcoin with hardware and software wallets, connected to full nodes. Developed by open-source programmer Christian Belcher, best known for his contributions to JoinMarket, the Electrum Personal Server directly addresses vulnerabilities with the popular Electrum Bitcoin wallet, while sparing users the significant resource usage of an Electrum server.

According to Belcher, connecting Electrum with the Electrum Personal Server is the most resource-efficient, secure and private way to use a hardware or software wallet connected to a full node. It is important for all users to connect their wallets to full nodes for the Bitcoin network to maintain long-term security, he maintains.

“If bitcoin is digital gold, then a full node wallet is your own personal goldsmith who checks for you that received payments are genuine,” explained Belcher in correspondence with Bitcoin Magazine.

Full Nodes vs. Thin Clients Refresher
In the Bitcoin blockchain, full nodes are programs that validate transactions and blocks on the network. Full nodes assist the network by accepting transactions and blocks from other full nodes, validating them and sharing them with other full nodes. Essentially, full nodes are the referees of the Bitcoin blockchain –– they check to see that chains are following the rules of the network and ignore chains who break them. As an example, Belcher noted that “[transactions] printing infinite money would be rejected by [full nodes] as if they never existed.” In this way, Bitcoin can ensure that no more than 21 million coins are ever minted.

While full nodes are the most secure, they are are also more resource-intensive. A full node takes up around 156 GB of disk space (a number which is growing by more than 50 GB per year), can take days to sync when used for the first time, requires significant amount of bandwidth each month, and takes up CPU power validating all transactions and blocks on the network.

Thin clients (also known as lightweight clients), however, do not download the entire Bitcoin blockchain. Instead, they only download a copy of all the headers for the blocks in the blockchain. Thin clients are able to achieve increased efficiency and speed by receiving notifications when a transaction affects their wallet specifically. But this does mean that thin clients must tell a third party which addresses belong to them, which is bad for privacy. Additionally, thin clients trade full validation and security for efficiency, placing their trust in full nodes to verify that rules are being followed on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Electrum
Since 2011, the Electrum wallet –– a light client –– has been among the community favorites. It features a pleasant user interface, hardware wallet connectivity, “forgiving” seed recovery phrases, cold storage solutions, decentralized servers to prevent downtimes, and multi-sig permissions. However, similar to other thin clients, the Electrum wallet’s lightweight connection with the Bitcoin blockchain comes at the cost of privacy, validity and scalability.

By default, the Electrum wallet sends all its bitcoin addresses to an Electrum server, which sends back a user’s history and balance. According to Belcher, “This means that the Electrum server knows all the user’s bitcoin addresses and could spy on them, essentially seeing everything a user does.” Users should note that anytime their bitcoin addresses are stored on a thin-client server, their transactions can be monitored.

Like other thin clients, if Electrum servers do not properly verify the rules of the Bitcoin blockchain, wallets can be deceived. For example, a compromised Electrum server could lead the Electrum wallet to accept a fake transaction for USD $1000 worth of bitcoin that would not have been validated by a full node.

Electrum servers also store records of every address ever used on the Bitcoin network, which, as user-base increases, poses a hindrance to scalability.

In the Electrum ecosystem, the only way for a user to avoid these vulnerabilities inherent to the Electrum thin client is to run their own Electrum server and connect it to their wallet. This fix is more resource-intensive than running a Bitcoin full node; it requires the unpruned Bitcoin blockchain, the full transaction index and extra address index. Electrum Servers are also more RAM and CPU intensive than full nodes, and are not made to be turned on and off efficiently.

Electrum Personal Server Solution
The Electrum Personal Server provides bitcoin users with increased efficiency, security and privacy. In this implementation of the Electrum server protocol, users seeking a full node connection can interact with all traditional Electrum wallet features while running a Bitcoin full node, instead of downloading an Electrum server.

Efficiency
From an efficiency perspective, connecting an Electrum wallet to a full node allows users to take advantage of resource-saving Bitcoin Core features such as pruning, disabled txindex and blocksonly. These features are not available to an Electrum server.

Users also benefit from the traditional Electrum wallet user experience/user interface and functionality such as hardware wallet integration, offline signing, recovery phrases and multi-signature wallets.

Security and Privacy
Because users are connected to a full node, they aren’t prone to any of the aforementioned privacy and security threats posed to thin clients.

There is a caveat –– users lose the popular “instant-on” feature of the Electrum wallet when using a full node such as the Electrum Personal Server. The full node must synchronize first, before displaying a wallet’s bitcoin balance. Depending on connection speeds and time since last connectivity, this process could take a few minutes or hours.

For users seeking to connect their wallet to an Electrum Personal Server, the process is fairly straightforward. According to Belcher’s blog post, users must:

Download the alpha version;
Configure the Electrum Personal server with their master public key. Those addresses are then imported into Bitcoin Core as watch-only;
Rescan the wallet if it contains historical transactions. There is no need to rescan, however, if a new, empty wallet is created.
Why Should the Average Bitcoin User Care?
Belcher outlined that since the inception of the Bitcoin network, the basic security model has relied on most of the economy using full node wallets, not thin clients that are vulnerable to manipulation. This way, legitimate Bitcoin transactions are always accurately verified, nefarious transactions are always rejected, and the hard limit of 21 million bitcoins (which are really just bits and bytes) is enforced.

Belcher believes that “bitcoin is dead in the long term” if most of the Bitcoin economy does not use full node wallets.

He hopes that the Electrum Personal Server can serve as a framework for other lightweight Bitcoin wallets to connect to full nodes run by users, rather than (centralized) servers. For instance, a Samourai Wallet or Breadwallet can utilize a script similar to the Electrum Personal Server to connect to a full node.",Technical,0.34
2018/2/19,Why These Researchers Think They Solved a Key Piece of the Puzzle,"New blockchains are born all the time. Bitcoin was the lone blockchain for years, but now there are hundreds. The problem is, if you want to use the features offered on another blockchain, you have to buy the tokens for that other blockchain.

But all that may soon change. One developing technology called sidechains promises to make it easier to move tokens across blockchains and, as a result, open the doors to a world of possibilities, including building bridges to the legacy financial systems of banks.

In October 2017, Aggelos Kiayias, professor at the University of Edinburgh and chief scientist at blockchain research and development company IOHK; Andrew Miller, professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; and Dionysis Zindros, researcher at the University of Athens, released the paper “Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work” (NiPoPoW), introducing a critical piece to the sidechains puzzle that had been missing for three years. This is the story of how they got there.

But, first, what exactly is a sidechain?    

Same Coin, Different Blockchain
A sidechain is a technology that allows you to move your tokens from one blockchain to another, use them on that other blockchain and then move them back at a later point in time, without the need for a third party.  

In the past, the parent blockchain has typically been Bitcoin, but a parent chain could be any blockchain. Also, when a token moves to another blockchain, it should maintain its same value. In other words, a bitcoin on an Ethereum sidechain would remain a bitcoin.  

The biggest advantage of sidechains is that they would allow users to access a host of new services. For instance, you could move bitcoin to another blockchain to take advantage of privacy features, faster transaction speeds and smart contracts.  

Sidechains have other uses, too. A sidechain could offer a more secure way to upgrade a protocol, or it could serve as a type of security firewall, so that in the event of a catastrophic disaster on a sidechain, the main chain would remain unaffected. “It is a kind of limited liability,” said Zindros in a video explaining how the technology works.

Finally, if banks were to create their own private blockchain networks, sidechains could enable communications with those networks, allowing users to issue and track shares, bonds and other assets.

Early Conversations
Early dialogue about sidechains first appeared in Bitcoin chat rooms around 2012, when Bitcoin Core developers were thinking of ways to safely upgrade the Bitcoin protocol.

One idea was for a “one-way peg,” where users could move bitcoin to a separate blockchain to test out a new client; however, once those assets were moved, they could not be moved back to the main chain.  

“I was thinking of this as a software engineering tool that could be used to make widespread changes,” Adam Back, now CEO at blockchain development company Blockstream, said in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. “You could say, we are going to make a new version [of Bitcoin], and we think it will be ready in a year, but in the meantime, you can opt in early and test it.”

According to Back, sometime in the following year, on the Bitcoin IRC channel, Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell suggested an idea for a “two-way peg,” where value could be transferred to the alternative chain and then back to Bitcoin at a later point.

A two-way peg addressed another growing concern at the time. Alternative coins, like Litecoin and Namecoin, were becoming increasingly popular. The fear was these “altcoins” would dilute the value of bitcoin. It made sense, Bitcoin Core developers thought, to keep bitcoin as a type of reserve currency, and relegate new features to sidechains. That way, “if you wanted to use a different feature, you wouldn’t have to buy a speculative asset,” said Back.

To turn the concept of sidechains into a reality, Back along with Maxwell and a few other Bitcoin Core developers formed Blockstream in 2014. In October that year, the group released “Enabling Blockchain Innovations with Pegged Sidechains,” a paper describing sidechains at a high level. Miller appears as a co-author on that paper as well.

How Sidechains Work
One important component of sidechains is a simplified payment verification (SPV) proof that shows that tokens have been locked up on one chain so validators can safely unlock an equivalent value on the alternative chain. But to work for sidechains, an SPV proof has to be small enough to fit into a single coinbase transaction, the transaction that rewards a miner with new coins. (Not to be confused with the company Coinbase.)

At the time the Blockstream researchers released their paper, they knew they needed a compressed SPV proof to get sidechains to work, but they had not yet developed the cryptography behind it. So they outlined general, high-level ideas.

The Blockstream paper describes two types of two-way pegs: a symmetric two-way peg, where both chains are independent with their own mining; and an asymmetric two-way peg, where sidechain miners are full validators of the parent chain.

In a symmetric two-way peg, a user sends her bitcoins to a special address. Doing so locks up the funds on the Bitcoin blockchain. That output remains locked for a contest period of maybe six blocks (one hour) to confirm the transaction has gone through, and then an SPV proof is created to send to the sidechain.

At that point, a corresponding transaction appears on the sidechain with the SPV proof, verifying that money has been locked up on the Bitcoin blockchain, and then coins with the same value of account are unlocked on the sidechain.

Coins are spent and change hands and, at a later point, are sent back to the main chain. When the coins are returned to the main chain, the process repeats. They are sent to a locked output on the sidechain, a waiting period goes by, and an SPV proof is created and sent back to the main blockchain to unlock coins on the main chain.  

In an asymmetric two-way peg, the process is slightly different. The transfer from the parent chain to the sidechain does not require an SPV proof, because validators on the sidechain are also aware of the state of the parent chain. An SPV proof is still needed, however, when the coins are returned to the parent chain.

Search for a Compact Proof
In a sidechain, a compact SPV proof needs to contain a compressed version of all the block headers in the chain where funds are locked up from the genesis block through the contest period, as well as transaction data and some other data. In this way, an SPV proof can also be thought of as a “proof of proof-of-work” for a particular output.

Inspiration for the compact SPV proof comes from a linked-list-like structure known as a “skip list” developed 25 years ago. In applying this structure to a compact SPV proof, the trick was in finding a way to skip block headers while still maintaining a high level of security so that an adversary would not be able to fake a proof.

In working through the problem, Blockstream showed an early draft of its sidechains paper to Miller, who had been mulling over compact SPVs for a few years already.

In August 2012, in a post on a BitcoinTalk forum titled “The High-Value-Hash Highway,” Miller described an idea for a “merkle skip list” that a Bitcoin light client could use to quickly determine the longest chain and begin using it. In that post, he described the significance of the data structure as “absolutely staggering.”

When Miller read through the Blockstream draft, he spotted a vulnerability in the compact SPV proof described in the paper. Discussions ensued, but they “couldn’t find a way to solve that problem without compromising efficiency,” Miller said.

Miller’s non-trivial contributions to the Blockstream paper ended up being a few paragraphs in Appendix B that describe the challenges in creating a compact SPV proof.

It should “be possible to greatly compress a list of headers while still proving the same amount of work,” the section reads, but “optimising these tradeoffs and formalising the security guarantees is out of scope for this paper and the topic of ongoing work.”

That ongoing work remained stuck for three years.

Making It Non-interactive
During that ensuing time, researchers at IOHK began taking a more serious interest in sidechains. Plans were taking shape for Cardano, a new proof-of-stake blockchain that IOHK had been contracted to build.

Cardano would consist of two layers: a settlement layer, launched in September 2017, where the money supply would be kept, and a smart contract layer. Those two layers would be two sidechain-enabled blockchains. In this way, the settlement could remain simple and secure from any attacks that might occur on the smart contract layer. But if IOHK was to get Cardano to work as intended, it needed to solve sidechains.

In February 2016, Kiayias, then a professor at the University of Athens, and two of his students, Nikolaos Lamprou and Aikaterini-Panagiota Stouka, released “Proofs of Proofs of Work with Sublinear Complexity” (PoPoW).

The paper was the first to formally address a compact SPV proof. Only, the proof described in the paper was interactive; whereas, to work for sidechains, it needed to be non-interactive.

In an interactive proof, the prover and the verifier enter into a back-and-forth conversation, meaning there could be more than one round of messaging. In contrast, a non-interactive proof would be a simple, short string of text that would fit neatly into a single transaction on the blockchain.

The PoPoW paper was presented at BITCOIN’16, a workshop affiliated with the International Financial Cryptography Association’s (IFCA) Financial Cryptography and Data Security conference. Miller, who was at the conference, approached Kiayias and shared an idea for making the protocol non-interactive.

It was a “nice observation,” Kiayias told Bitcoin Magazine, but making the proof secure was “not obvious at all” and would require significant work.

Zindros, who had just started working on his PhD under Kiayias, was also at the conference, and he needed a topic for his thesis. Kiayias saw a good fit, “so we pressed on, the three of us, and adapted the PoPoW protocol and its proof of security to the non-interactive setting,” Kiayias said.

In October 2016, Kiayias officially joined IOHK, and a year later, Kiayias, Miller and Zindros released “Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work,” introducing a compact SPV proof five years after sidechains had first been talked about on Bitcoin forums.

“If it were interactive, I don’t know if it would have worked; with a non-interactive proof, it is really smooth,” Zindros told Bitcoin Magazine.

More Work to Be Done
Even with NiPoPoW, sidechains are still not fully specified. Several questions remain, including, how small can the proofs be made? After a transaction is locked up on one chain, how much time needs to pass before it can be spent on the other? And, will it be possible to move a token from a sidechain directly to another sidechain?

“A lot of theory still needs to be defined,” IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson said in speaking to Bitcoin Magazine.

Also, while NiPoPoW is designed to work for proof-of-work blockchains, some believe that if blockchains are to take their place in the world on a grand scale, the future rests in proof-of-stake protocols like Ouroboros, Algorand or Snow White, which promise to be more energy-efficient than Bitcoin.

In particular, if Cardano, which is based on Ouroboros, is to work according to plan, IOHK researchers still need to discover a non-interactive proof of proof-of-stake (NiPoPoS).

Hoskinson is confident. “We can definitely do that,” he said. “We can definitely have a NiPoPoS. The question is how many megabytes or kilobytes is it going to be? Can we bring it down to 100 KB? That is really the question.”",Technical,0.2732
2018/2/26,Bitcoin Core 0.16.0 Is Released: Here’s What’s New,"Today marks the official release of Bitcoin Core 0.16.0, the 16th generation of Bitcoin’s original software client launched by Satoshi Nakamoto a little over nine years ago. Overseen by Bitcoin Core lead maintainer Wladimir van der Laan, this latest major release was developed by some 100 contributors over a span of five months.

As is usual for new releases, Bitcoin Core 0.16.0 includes performance improvements, bug fixes and other optimizations. This release in particular includes several added features in the wallet interface. Most notably, Bitcoin Core 0.16.0 makes Segregated Witness (SegWit) fully available for wallet users, which is what most of the effort was focused on, and it is also why this release is sometimes referred to as a “SegWit special.”

Here’s an overview of some of the most notable changes.

Segregated Witness in the Wallet Interface
Segregated Witness was, of course, the main Bitcoin protocol upgrade of 2017, if not the biggest protocol upgrade ever. It introduced a whole new block data structure for upgraded nodes — while non-upgraded nodes could continue to function as normal. Among other benefits, SegWit replaced Bitcoin’s block size limit with a block “weight” limit, allowing for blocks with up to 4 megabytes of transaction data and, therefore, increased transaction capacity on the network.

Segregated Witness itself was first introduced in Bitcoin Core 0.13.1, released in October 2016. The upgrade activated in August of 2017. However, Bitcoin Core 0.16.0 is the first Bitcoin Core version to let wallet users generate SegWit addresses for receiving payments. This means that when the funds received on these addresses are spent in a payment later, Bitcoin Core wallet users utilize the added block space offered by SegWit. All else being equal, these users should be able to pay lower fees compared to non-SegWit transactions.

Bitcoin Core is not the first wallet to enable Segregated Witness for users; several other wallets had already introduced this feature over the past six months. Since the Bitcoin Core development team wrote and proposed the upgrade, it was notable that the feature had not been available for Bitcoin Core wallet users — until now.

Bech32: Bitcoin’s New Address Format
Accompanying the introduction of SegWit in the Bitcoin Core wallet is a new address format known as “bech32.” This address format, developed by former Blockstream CTO Gregory Maxwell and Blockstream developer Dr. Pieter Wuille, is recognizable as it starts with “bc1” instead of the 1 or 3 that Bitcoin addresses usually start with. More importantly, bech32 addresses use fewer characters than the current address format, because there’s no longer a distinction between lowercase and capital letters. This reduces the potential for human mistakes (for example, when an address is read out loud). Bech32 addresses are also designed to limit other types of mistakes such as these caused by typos.

Additionally, bech32 offers benefits in the context of SegWit wallet support. So far, most wallets that offer SegWit do so by “wrapping” it into P2SH outputs (with addresses starting with a 3). To spend coins from such an address, users must reveal a piece of code — the “redeem script” — to show that the coins were really locked up in a SegWit output. With the new bech32 addresses, this step can be skipped, which means that spending from a SegWit address will require a little less data to be transmitted over the Bitcoin network and included in the blockchain.

Since not all Bitcoin wallets support bech32 addresses yet, Bitcoin Core 0.16.0 users will be able to choose whether they want to generate a bech32 receiving address for payments or a P2SH address, with P2SH still being the default for now. The Bitcoin Core wallet of course supports sending transactions to any type of Bitcoin address.

Replace-by-Fee as the Default Sending Option
As Bitcoin blocks have been filling up over the past couple of years, not all transactions on the network fit in the first available block that is mined. Instead, miners typically prioritize the transactions that include the most fees. If users want to have their transactions confirmed quickly, they should include a high enough fee. For less urgent transactions, a lower fee should suffice. Many wallets include fee-estimation algorithms to calculate what fee level will have a transaction confirmed within varying timeframes.

However, the Bitcoin network deals with inherent unpredictability in terms of the speed at which blocks are found, and the number of transactions that is being transmitted at any time. This can make it difficult to include the right transaction fee, meaning that users may have to wait longer for a confirmation than they’d intended.

Since Bitcoin Core 0.15.0, wallet users have been able to add a “replace-by-fee” tag to their transactions. With such a tag, nodes and miners on the network know that the sender may want to replace that transaction with a newer transaction that includes a higher fee. This effectively lets Bitcoin Core wallet users easily bump their transactions up in line to have it confirmed faster.

Bitcoin Core 0.16.0 makes replace-by-fee the default sending option for the first time. Users can still opt out of adding a replace-by-fee tag to their transactions by unticking a box, but their transactions will be replaceable if they don’t untick it.

2018/3/1,Researchers Explore Eclipse Attacks on the Ethereum Blockchain,"An eclipse attack is a network-level attack on a blockchain, where an attacker essentially takes control of the peer-to-peer network, obscuring a node’s view of the blockchain.

In a new paper titled “Low-Resource Eclipse Attacks on Ethereum’s Peer-to-Peer Network,” Sharon Goldberg, an associate professor at Boston University; Ethan Heilman, a Ph.D. candidate at Boston University; and Yuval Marcus, a researcher at the University of Pittsburgh, describe a way to carry out an eclipse attack on the Ethereum network.

(The researchers disclosed their attacks to Ethereum on January 9, 2018, and Ethereum developers have already issued a patch — Geth v1.8.1 — to fix the network.)  

In speaking with Bitcoin Magazine, Goldberg explained the research, how it compares to Bitcoin eclipse attacks and why she thinks the work is important.

First, she emphasized that working with Ethereum developers to fix the vulnerability was a smooth process. “It was a very functional, easy disclosure,” she said.

In an email to Bitcoin Magazine, Martin Holst Swende, security lead at Ethereum Foundation — the nonprofit that oversees the development of Ethereum — explained that the recent Geth patch contains several modifications to the peer-to-peer layer and does not affect consensus-critical code. Users need not be concerned because “an eclipse-attack is a targeted attack against a specific victim,” he wrote, adding, “Nevertheless, we recommend all users to upgrade to 1.8.1.”

Splitting the Network
As in Bitcoin, a node on the Ethereum network relies on connections to its peers to get a full view of the network. In an eclipse attack, an attacker takes control of all the connections going to and from a targeted victim’s node. This way, an attacker prevents that victim from obtaining full information about other parts of the network.

People often think of an eclipse attack as a way to co-opt the mining power of the network around consensus, but an eclipse attack is particularly useful in a double-spend attack. A payee can send coins for a transaction and use the eclipse attack to prevent the receiver from learning that those same coins were used in another transaction in another part of the network.

Goldberg and Heilman, along with two other researchers, published the first paper on eclipse attacks on the Bitcoin network three years ago. Working with a new intern (Marcus), they wanted to explore the same type of attacks on Ethereum. “We were curious how it compared to Bitcoin,” Goldberg said.

“Totally Different”
Goldberg described launching an eclipse attack on Ethereum as “totally different” to launching one on Bitcoin. To pull off an eclipse attack on Bitcoin, an adversary needs to control a large number of IP addresses (machines) to monopolize the connections going to and from a victim’s node. This makes it a very costly attack in Bitcoin.

In contrast, researchers were able to launch similar attacks in Ethereum using just one or two machines, making eclipse attacks on Ethereum a lot stronger than those on Bitcoin. “That part surprised me a little bit,” she said.

So how big of a deal is this? “It is hard to know,” Goldberg said in explaining that what keeps the bar high in launching this type of attack in Ethereum is not the difficulty of the attack but rather the lack of understanding around how the Ethereum peer-to-peer network works. As Goldberg noted, the Ethereum network is “largely undocumented.”

Just as in the earlier work on the Bitcoin network, in working on Ethereum, the researchers had to reverse engineer the protocol based on the code and write their own parsers from packets, so everything was done from scratch. “It is difficult to do that work, and it takes a while,” said Goldberg.   

Less Resilient
At first glance, Ethereum appears to be more resilient to eclipse attacks. While Bitcoin nodes make only eight outgoing TCP connections to form the gossip network that propagates transactions and blocks, Ethereum nodes make 13. And while Ethereum’s peer-to-peer network uses a secure encrypted channel, Bitcoin’s network does not.

But, as it turns out, Ethereum was actually easier to attack mainly because while Bitcoin relies on an unstructured network where nodes form random connections with each other, Ethereum relies on a structured network based on a protocol called Kademlia, which is designed to allow nodes to connect to other nodes more efficiently.  

Nodes in Ethereum’s peer-to-peer network are identified by their public key. Remarkably, Ethereum versions (prior to Geth v1.8.1) allowed a user to run an unlimited number of nodes, each with a different public key, from the same machine with the same IP address.

By using a key generation algorithm, an attacker could create an unlimited number of node IDs (identifiers on the peer-to-peer network) very quickly. Worse, an attacker could even create node IDs in a way that made them more attractive to the victim than a random node ID, basically drawing the victim to them.  

“You see that a lot in Kademlia attacks,” said Goldberg.

More Work Ahead
Goldberg says she is not clear why Ethereum chose a Kademlia network in the first place. A structured peer-to-peer network is generally used to take some content, like a movie, break it into pieces and send those pieces to different peers and download pieces from each peer, similar to how BitTorrent, a peer-to-peer file sharing protocol, works.

But on Ethereum, the content is the Ethereum blockchain, and nodes store the entire blockchain locally. There is no requirement to break the blockchain up and have each node store only a few pieces of it. “I think it was an interesting design decision because I always think that an unstructured network would be safer for a blockchain system,” Goldberg said.

Goldberg indicated she would like to see more researchers dig down into the guts of the blockchain to get a better understanding how the “less sexy” parts work.

“We build sophisticated systems on top of this infrastructure and it is important people make sure that the infrastructure itself is secure,” she said.  

Researchers like Goldberg, Heilman and Marcus play an important role in the Ethereum ecosystem. The researchers submitted their finding via Ethereum’s bug bounty program, a program that rewards individuals for submitting bugs.

“Goldberg et. al. have responsibly shared the paper with us prior to public release and have graciously been of assistance evaluating the patches to Geth,” Ethereum Foundation’s Holst Swende confirmed.",Technical,-0.9717
2018/3/15,Lightning’s First Implementation Is Now in Beta; Developers Raise $2.5M,"Today, March 15, Lightning Labs announced lnd 0.4-beta, the first beta release of the Lightning software implementation spearheaded by the development company. This makes lnd the first ever Lightning implementation to be marked as beta, meaning that the development team deems it to be feature complete and safe enough for use on Bitcoin’s mainnet — though the software could still contain bugs. In conjunction, Lightning Labs has also announced a $2.5 million seed investment round, which will fund further development of lnd.

“We're calling this lnd release a beta as it has all the necessary safety, fault-tolerance and security features that we've deemed necessary to feel comfortable with early users to start experimenting with small amounts of real bitcoin and litecoin,” Lightning Labs CTO Olaoluwa Osuntokun told Bitcoin Magazine.

As an open and permissionless project, the Lightning Network was already being rolled out by users eager to test the highly anticipated scaling layer — even before any Lightning implementation was released in beta. Lightning Labs, in particular, favored a more cautious approach, as the development team was still working on “breaking changes,” Osuntokun explained. He noted that users who have opened payment channels with previous lnd releases will now have to close these channels before upgrading to the latest version.

A significant step compared to previous lnd releases is that the new software is compatible with various Bitcoin implementations. Where the alpha versions of lnd relied on btcd to interact with Bitcoin’s blockchain (both lnd and btcd are written in Google’s Go programming language), the beta release gives users the option to use their own preferred backend, including bitcoind (part of Bitcoin Core, in C++), Bcoin (JavaScript) and others.

Other new features implemented in the lnd beta include a new private key seed format specifically designed for Lightning; improved fault-tolerance in case something goes wrong; and smarter pathfinding for routing payments, as well as bug fixes and other improvements.

In conjunction with the software release, Lightning Labs announced a seed-funding round of $2.5 million to fund continued development of lnd. Investors include big names in the Bitcoin, blockchain and broader tech industry, such as Litecoin creator Charlie Lee; BitGo CTO Ben Davenport; Square and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey; former PayPal COO and Yammer founder David Sacks; Tesla and SpaceX angel investor Bill Lee; head of Square Capital and Square’s People Lead Jacqueline Reses; Eventbrite co-founder Kevin Hartz; Robinhood co-founder Vlad Tenev; and The Hive, Digital Currency Group and others.

Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark hopes that, with the release of the lnd beta and the seed-funding round, development of Lightning Network technology will move to its next phase.

“Lightning is not just about scalability, it’s also an app development platform. I think a lot of people don't get that yet,” she told Bitcoin Magazine.

Building on lnd, developers can write apps that connect to the Lightning Network. Lightning Lab’s Lightning App Directory already features several dozen such apps, not limited to apps developed by Lightning Labs itself. Examples include Lightning wallets for desktop and mobile, a blogging platform with micropayments, a gambling site and more. Although most of these apps are only available on Bitcoin’s testnet so far, this is likely to change with the release of lnd 0.4-beta.

Moving forward, Lightning Labs plans to implement a range of new features in lnd, including “watchtowers” to outsource security (channel monitoring) to third parties, atomic multipath payments to increase payment channel liquidity, routing tools for Lightning node operators and more. And while lnd is already compatible with both Bitcoin and Litecoin, the two networks are not yet interoperable; a fix for this is also planned for a future release.

It should be noted that although the lnd 0.4-beta release marks a milestone in the development of the Lightning Network, it is still in beta — so it is still somewhat risky to use.

“This is still an early beta version aimed at developers and advanced users,” Stark said. “As with any early software there will still be bugs. Users shouldn't be putting more money on Lightning right now than they are willing to lose.”

2018/3/19,Stellar Gears Up to Implement Lightning Network,"Last week, on March 15, 2018, Lightning Labs unveiled their beta for the Lightning Network in a flash of media attention and enthusiasm. The Lightning Network has been heralded as a solution to Bitcoin’s scalability issues, and the developments were greeted by the community with tremendous optimism.

A little less than a week later, the Stellar network team has announced that they will be integrating the Lightning Network. That makes Stellar among the first projects to formally announce integration of the Lightning Network since the beta release last week.

“We’re super excited about Lighting,” Stellar founder Jed McCaleb told Bitcoin Magazine in an interview. “It’s a great idea and a necessary one if any of these protocols are going to achieve their vision.”

To McCaleb, Stellar isn’t an exception, and he believes that the Lightning Network will be integral to the growth of the platform going forward:

“We have a lot of partnerships that have been announced and that will be announced soon that will start pushing the threshold for what Stellar can do. In order to keep the network efficient and stable, we need something like Lightning.”

The blog post echoes these sentiments, as it claims that the Lightning Network will help Stellar move forward into a more scalable future. McCaleb has actually toyed with the idea of implementing the Lightning Network since the technology’s theoretical infancy. In a 2015 blog post, he wrote somewhat of a treatise on the subject, outlining how the network operates and stating that a “Lightning-like system” is already feasible on Stellar.

With today’s announcement, McCaleb and the rest of the team are dropping the “like” and keeping the “Lightning,” going for a full-scale implementation on Stellar’s platform. They’ve released a tentative timeline regarding this implementation that included a BUMP_SEQUENCE testnet on April 1, 2018; beta implementation for state channels on August 1, 2018; a livenet on Stellar for these state channels and a Lightning Network Beta on October 1, 2018; and fully functional livenet for the Lightning Network on December 1, 2018.

The addition of the BUMP_SEQUENCE operation and state channels are hallmarks of Stellar’s individual implementation of the technology and reflect McCaleb’s original plans for Stellar’s use of it. Like payment channels on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, state channels will be the off-chain avenue through which users can conduct payments, but they’ll be open to additional network features, as well, “such as … creating, deleting or changing permissions on accounts.”

These channels will make use of source accounts and sequence numbers to keep tabs on payments before the finalizing transaction is sent to the network. As the name suggests, a source account represents a user’s account on a state channel, and the sequence number tracks the number and sequence of payments made within that channel.

According to the blog post, “The new operation enables transactions to arbitrarily increase the sequence number of a target account.”

The team will release further developments to detail how state channels can be used for “multi-hop payments” between users without established channels and cross-chain atomic swaps. In addition, it invites peer review and feedback from the community and researchers as the current schematics are not final.

For now, though, McCaleb and the rest of the team are focused on getting the ball rolling so Stellar users — and the rest of the crypto ecosystem — can start reaping Lightning’s benefits:

“There’s three main benefits,” he said to Bitcoin Magazine. “There’s the scalability benefit, obviously — Stellar can scale pretty well right now but Lightning takes that much, much further; there’s privacy benefits, as Lightning allows transactions to be kept off the public ledger; and then there’s also interoperability,” he said in reference to the prospect of Atomic Swaps.

“It should make a much more flexible, interoperable ecosystem which is good for everyone.”",Technical,0.9946
2018/3/20,Op Ed: The Many Faces of Sharding for Blockchain Scalability,"Any programmer who has ever sat down to build a DApp at one point has had to think about the limits of current public blockchains, the most important and obvious one being their limited throughput, i.e., the number of transactions processed per second. In order to run a DApp that can handle real-world throughput requirements, blockchains must become scalable.

One answer to blockchain scaling is sharding. Sharding promises to increase the throughput by changing the way blocks get validated by the network. The key feature of sharding that makes it unique among all (on-chain) scaling solutions is horizontal scaling, i.e., the throughput increases as the mining network expands. This particular characteristic of sharding may make it the ideal fuel to spur rapid adoption of blockchain technology.

This article will briefly discuss the scaling issues with existing blockchain platforms — briefly only, because most readers must already be familiar with it. It will then discuss how sharding and its different forms can be a promising solution to the scaling problem. It will also touch upon some of the theoretical and practical challenges to implementing sharding and how some of these challenges can be overcome.

Scalability Issues With Existing Blockchains
One of the biggest problems that public blockchain platforms face today is scalability. All popular platforms are struggling to handle a larger number of transactions per second. In fact, today the public Ethereum and Bitcoin networks can handle 7-10 transactions per second on average. These figures are far inferior to those of centralized payment processors like Visa, which processes roughly 8,000 transactions per second on average.

Slow transaction processing creates a major problem because they choke up the networks, making it difficult to use the blockchain for applications such as real-time payments. The longer a payment takes to be processed, the more inconvenient it becomes for the end user; this is one of the main reasons why payment methods like PayPal and credit cards like Visa are still much more attractive. As more complex DApps start to rely on the same network, the problems caused by slower transaction speed will only compound.

From a more technical standpoint, all blockchain consensus protocols have a challenging limitation: Every fully participating node in the network must validate every transaction and must seek agreement from other nodes on it, and this is the component of blockchain technology that creates distributed ledgers and makes it secure.

In most chains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, nodes are run by the public. While the decentralized consensus mechanism provides some vital advantages such as fault tolerance, security, political neutrality and authenticity, this method to verify chains comes at the cost of scalability. It will take more and more processing power to verify these public blockchains as they get larger, and this may create bottlenecks in these networks and slow down the creation of new applications.

Sharding: Divide and Conquer
Sharding is a scaling technique that was inspired by a traditional concept of database sharding, whereby a database is partitioned into several pieces and placed on different servers. In the context of a public blockchain, the transaction load on the network would be divided into different shards comprising different nodes on the network. As a consequence, each node would process only a fraction of incoming transactions, and it would do so in parallel with other nodes on the network. Breaking the network into shards would result in more transactions being processed and verified simultaneously. As a result, it becomes possible to process more and more transactions as the network grows. This property is also referred to as horizontal scaling.

We could imagine that existing blockchains operate like a busy highway with one toll station operating on only one toll booth. The result would be a traffic jam as people wait in long lines to pass the toll station. Implementing a sharding-based blockchain is like adding 15 or 20 toll booths to the highway. It would dramatically improve the rate at which traffic can progress through the stations. Sharding would make a tremendous amount of difference and dramatically improve transaction speed.

The implementation of sharding-based blockchains could have various benefits for public blockchains. First, thousands of transactions or even more could be processed every single second, changing the way people feel about the efficiency of cryptocurrencies as payment methods. Improving transaction throughput will bring more and more users and applications to decentralized systems, and this will, in turn, advocate further adoption of blockchains, making mining more profitable and attract more nodes to public networks, creating a virtuous cycle.

Furthermore, sharding could help bring down transaction fees since less processing will be needed to validate a single transaction; nodes can charge smaller fees and still be profitable to run. Coupling low fees with high transaction processing capability, public chains will become increasingly attractive to real-world use cases. The more these positive trends continue, the more mainstream adoption we’ll see of cryptocurrencies and blockchain applications in general.

Sharding Strategies
This is the basic concept, but there are more granular ways to implement sharding strategies like network and transaction sharding, and state sharding. With network and transaction sharding, the network of blockchain nodes is split into different shards, with each shard formed to process and reach consensus on a different subset of transactions. This way, unconnected subsets of transactions can be processed in parallel, significantly boosting the transaction throughput by orders of magnitude.

On the other hand, on today’s mainstream public blockchains, the burden of storing transactions, smart contracts and various states is borne by all public nodes, which could make it prohibitively expensive in terms of required storage space to maintain ongoing operations on the blockchain.

One potential approach, called state sharding, has been proposed to resolve this issue. The crux is to divide the entire storage into pieces and let different shards store different parts; thus every node is only responsible for hosting its own shard’s data instead of the complete blockchain state.

Complexities Underlying Sharding
While all the different forms of sharding may be very intuitive, unspooling the technical details can reveal the complexity of the approaches and the underlying challenges. Some of these challenges are easy to overcome, while others not quite so. Generally speaking, network and transaction sharding are easier to accomplish while state sharding is much more complicated. Below, for the different sharding mechanisms, we categorically discuss some of these challenges and how feasible are they to be overcome.

Network Sharding
The first and foremost challenge in sharding is the creation of shards. A mechanism will need to be developed to determine which nodes reside in which shard in a secure way in order to avoid possible attacks from someone who gains a lot of control over a particular shard.

The best approach to beat an adversary (at least in most of the cases) is through randomness. By leveraging randomness, it should become possible for the network to randomly sample nodes to form a shard. Random sampling prevents malicious nodes from overpopulating a single shard.

But, where should the randomness come from? The most readily available source of public randomness is in blocks, for instance, the Merkle tree root of transactions. The randomness available in blocks is publicly verifiable and (close to) uniform random bits can be extracted from it through randomness extractors.

However, simply having a randomized mechanism to assign nodes to a shard is not sufficient. One must also ensure that the network agrees on the members in a shard. This can be achieved through a consensus protocol like proof of work, for example.

Transaction Sharding
Transaction sharding isn’t as simple as it may sound. Consider introducing transaction sharding in a Bitcoin-like system (without smart contracts), where the state of the system is defined using UTXOs. Let us suppose that the network is already composed of shards and a user sends out a transaction. The transaction has two inputs and one output. Now, how should this transaction be assigned to a shard?

The most intuitive approach would be to decide on the shard based on the last few bits of the transaction hash. For instance, if the last bit of the hash is 0, then the transaction is assigned to the first shard, else it is assigned to the second shard (assuming we have only two shards). This allows the transaction to be validated within a single shard. However, if the user is malicious, he may create another transaction with the same two inputs but a different output — yes, a double spend. The second transaction will have a different hash and, hence, the two transactions may end up in different shards. Each shard will then separately validate the received transaction while being oblivious of the double-spend transaction being validated in the other shard.

In order to prevent the double spend, the shards will have to communicate with each other while the validation is in progress. In fact, since the double-spend transaction may land in any shard, a given shard receiving a transaction will have to communicate with every other shard. The communication overhead may, in fact, defeat the entire purpose of transaction sharding.

On the other hand, the problem is much simpler to solve when we have an account-based system (without smart contracts). Each transaction then will have a sender’s address and can then be assigned to a shard based on the sender’s address. This ensures that two double-spend transactions will get validated in the same shard and hence can be easily detected without any cross-shard communication.

State Sharding
With the promises of state sharding come a new set of challenges. As a matter of fact, state sharding is the most challenging of all sharding proposals so far.

Continuing with our account-based model (let us not bring in smart contracts for the moment), in a state-sharded blockchain, a specific shard will only maintain a portion of the state. For instance, if we have two shards and only two user accounts, say for Alice and Bob, respectively, then each shard will keep the balance of one single user.

Imagine that Alice creates a transaction to pay Bob. The transaction will be handled by the first shard. Once the transaction is validated, the information about Bob’s new balance must be shared with his shard. If two popular accounts are handled by different shards, then this may entail frequent cross-shard communication and state exchange. Ensuring that cross-shard communication will not outweigh the performance gains from state sharding is still an open research problem.

One possible way to reduce the cross-shard communication overhead is to restrict users from making cross-shard transactions. With our example, this would mean that Alice would not be allowed to transact directly with Bob. If ever Alice has to transact with Bob, she will have to hold an account in that shard. While this does eliminate any cross-shard communication, it may limit the usability of the platform somewhat.

The second challenge with state sharding is data availability. Consider a scenario where, for some reason, a given shard is attacked and goes offline. Since the state of the system is not replicated across all shards, the network can no longer validate transactions that have dependency on the offline shard. As a result, the blockchain may become largely unusable. A solution to this problem is to maintain archival or backup nodes that can help the network troubleshoot and recover from data unavailability. However, those nodes will then have to store the entire state of the system and hence may introduce centralization risks.

Another point to consider in any sharding mechanism (certainly not specific to state sharding) is to ensure that shards are not static for resilience against attacks and failures; the network must accept new nodes and assign them in a random manner to different shards. In other words, the network must get reshuffled once in a while.

However, reshuffling in the case of state sharding is tricky. Since each shard only maintains a portion of the state, reshuffling the network in one go may render the entire system unavailable until some synchronization is completed. To prevent outage, the network must be reshuffled gradually to ensure that every shard has enough old nodes before a node is evicted.

Similarly, once a new node joins a shard, one has to ensure that the node is given ample time to sync with the state of the shard; otherwise the incoming node will reject outright every single transaction.

Conclusion
In conclusion, sharding is definitely an exciting and promising direction for blockchains to pursue in order to solve scalability problems without compromising decentralization and transparency. However, there is no doubt that sharding, particularly state sharding, is notoriously difficult to do right both at the design level and at the implementation level.

Sharding should be handled with care. Also, more research needs to be done to establish the viability of state sharding as it may not be the silver bullet to storage problems. Researchers and developers are actively seeking alternate solutions at this moment. And perhaps, the answer is just right around the corner.

2018/3/22,Bug Caught That Allowed Coinbase Users to Garner Unlimited Amounts of Ether,"On March 20, 2018, it was revealed that a bug hidden in Coinbase’s Ethereum smart contract setup could have given users access to unlimited amounts of ether. At press time, it does not appear as though the vulnerability was ever exploited or even noticed by users.

The issue was first discovered last December by VI Company, a Dutch firm that specializes in fintech. The company was planning to give its employees ether bonuses in celebration of the upcoming holiday season when researchers noticed the issue with their “ETH receiving code” while garnering funds from a contract. They saw that by using a smart contract, a series of digital wallets could be “tricked” into recording ether transfers and purchases that had never actually happened.

The team issued the following statement in a vulnerability report later published on the firm’s HackerOne account in January 2018:

“By using a smart contract to distribute [ETH] over a set of wallets, you can manipulate the account balance of your Coinbase account. If [one] wallet transaction in the smart contract fails, all transactions before that will be reversed, but on Coinbase, these transactions will not be reversed, meaning a person could add as much Ethereum to their balance as they want.”

The report specified the following steps for taking advantage of the exchange’s weakness:

Set up a smart contract with a few valid Coinbase wallets and [one] final faulty wallet.
Transfer appropriate funds to the smart contract.
Execute smart contract adding the set amount of ether to the Coinbase wallets without ever actually leaving the smart contract wallet because the complete transaction fails at the last wallet.
Repeat until you have more than enough ether in your Coinbase wallet.
Cash out, transfer to offsite wallet.
Had users noticed the glitch, they could have been able to turn themselves into crypto-billionaires overnight.

The problem was resolved after the team changed the contract handling logic. VI Company claimed there were only “accidental” losses for Coinbase and stated there were no attempts to exploit the vulnerability. Coinbase executives later thanked VI Company’s counterparts by sending them a $10,000 bounty for their work.

Though instances like these are rare, they can occur from time to time. In February 2018, popular Japanese exchange Zaif aroused heavy controversy after a bug was exposed that allowed users to purchase bitcoin through its system at no charge. Representatives of the company claimed the error occurred within its “price calculation system” and that seven transactions had occurred where customers bought bitcoin for zero yen. Six of these transactions were later reversed.

Zaif’s parent company, Tech Bureau Corp, had faced several checks the previous month after regulators claimed it was vulnerable to cyberattacks. The exchange later apologized to users, saying the problem would not affect individual customer amounts. Zaif is one of a small handful of cryptocurrency trading platforms currently registered with the Japanese government.",Technical,0.5647
2018/4/2,Going Meta: Vitalik Buterin Issues Proposal for Capping Ethereum’s Supply,"On a day when the cryptocurrency community was on high alert for gags, whimsical announcements and other tomfoolery, the creator of Ethereum, known for pulling his own pranks in the past, stepped forth with a most serious proposal: setting a cap on Ethereum’s monetary supply — which has long had no cap at all — at 120 million.

On April 1, 2018, a day known as April Fools’ Day, Vitalik Buterin published Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 960 to limit the supply of ether (ETH) to 120,204,432 — twice the amount issued in the project’s presale in 2014. To those paying close attention, the proposal was listed under “meta,” a hint that this was a meta joke, meant to leave people scratching their heads and wondering if he was being serious or not.

All meta joking aside, the proposal recommends implementing the cap as part of a hard fork when the platform switches from its proof-of-work consensus algorithm to Casper, a proof-of stake algorithm still in development, as early as the end of this year.


“In order to ensure the economic sustainability of the platform under the widest possible variety of circumstances, and in light of the fact that issuing new coins to proof of work miners is no longer an effective way of promoting an egalitarian coin distribution or any other significant policy goal, I propose that we agree on a hard cap for the total quantity of ETH,” the proposal states.

This is the first time Buterin has suggested setting a limit on Ethereum’s supply of ether.  

Why Set a Cap?
Some argue that a supply limit is important to a cryptocurrency because it creates scarcity, making a “coin” more valuable, sort of like gold. Yet, a hard cap can also mean there is no way to replenish the supply when coins fall out of circulation due to people dying, losing them or even holding on to them.

Unlike Bitcoin, which has a supply limit of 21 million coins programmed into it, Ethereum has never had a monetary cap, which means over time the number of ether in the system could go up indefinitely.

As it stands, 60 million ether were initially created during the Ethereum presale to raise money for building the network. Following the network’s launch in 2015, five new ether have been created for every new block, every 15 seconds. That brings the current supply of ether to around 98.5 million and counting. If EIP 960 goes through, the new cap would likely require reducing the issuance of new coins or finding a way to balance the supply.  

For instance, in an earlier blog post, Buterin talks about introducing “sinks” or fees into the system that would lead to ether actually being destroyed, as a way to create more scarcity.

Making Way for Casper
Buterin’s proposal to change Ethereum’s monetary policy is timely because it sets the stage for Casper, which will introduce changes to how ether are distributed and used.

Buterin’s arguments for a supply cap are based on the idea that in a proof-of-stake system, the coin holders themselves are the ones who get the block rewards, not the miners. Also, because proof of stake consumes far less energy than proof of work, block rewards can be lower. Finally, he thinks the money supply can be better controlled through a system of fees and rewards paid by those using the platform.

It is important to keep in mind that EIP 960 is only a proposal and not certain to be adopted.",Technical,0.9526
2018/4/4,"Not a Month Into Beta, Lightning Applications Continue to Grow","With the advent of the long-anticipated Lightning Network (LN), crypto enthusiasts have more to look forward to than faster, cheaper transactions. Just as smart contracts brought DApps to Ethereum’s network, the Lightning Network is primed to bring a host of Lightning apps to Bitcoin. These applications, fittingly dubbed LApps, will leverage the Lightning Network to usher in a new generation of payment applications to the blockchain industry.

Lightning Labs rolled-out their beta for the first implementation of the Lightning Network on March 15, 2018. In practice, the Lightning Network allows Bitcoin users to send transactions on an off-chain network through payment channels. Since these channels aren’t connected to the blockchain, users can send near-instant transactions, however small they may be, without incurring exorbitant fees.

Before the Lightning Network went live, Lightning Labs launched their Lightning Desktop Wallet so users could get a feel for the network while it was in testnet. Now that the LN is in full beta, Lightning Lab’s wallet has been joined by Zap, a user-friendly wallet by Jack Mallers that’s meant to make the Lightning Network more accessible to the general public.

In the few weeks since its release, developers have introduced LApps for the network that look outside the limits of mere wallet and payment channel functionality. Now, there are dozens of Lightning applications for any of four distinct implementation (lnd, eclair, c-lightning and lit) across four programming languages (Go, C, Scala and Java), as developers continue to build on the technology.

One such developer, Nadav Ivgi, has been particularly busy. He’s the man behind the seven new applications showcased during Blockstream’s “Week of LApps.” The blockchain development company presented the projects as an extension of Lightning Charge, a payment processing solution for c-lightning, Blockstream’s implementation of the protocol in the C programming language.

Among these creations, Ivgi gives us nanotip, a tipbot that gives content creators and users an LN alternative to traditional bitcoin tipbots. Complementing the WooCommerce Lightning Gateway, one of Blockstream’s first LApps, Lightning Publisher is an additional WordPress plug-in that gives publishers an ad-free revenue alternative. With it, they can charge their readers a subscription to access content, payable through LN payment channels. Similarly, FileBazaar lets content creators monetize their data and files — be they pictures, videos or other documents — with an online marketplace that offers pay-per-view access to such content.

Lightning Charge’s LApp suite also comes with its own point-of-sale solution for merchants, nanopos. As one might imagine, point-of-sale applications have proliferated for the Lightning Network, as developers grind out code to find a solution to the market’s needs. Among these, we have another WooCommerce plug-in built on the Lightning Network Daemon (lnd), and Strike, a Stripe-esque API for merchants built with Eclair, the Scala programming language’s implementation of the LN. Eclair is also working on Lightning Conductor, an application that would allow users to convert their payment channel balances to bitcoin and back without closing the channels themselves.

Payment solution LApps abound but that hasn’t kept developers from building innovative, more nuanced applications for the Lightning Network. Take, for instance, Bitrefill, an application that allows you to top-off a prepaid mobile phone card with payment channels, or CoinMall, a Lightning-powered online marketplace for digital products. There’s even a Slack tipbot and one called CoinTippy for Reddit, Twitter, Telegram and other platforms. And then there’s 1ML, a search engine built to track nodes, applications and other aspects of the LN ecosystem.

There are more unconventional and curious manifestations still. Bitquest, a crypto-centric Minecraft server, is getting its own Lightning payments option, while Lightning Gem and Thunderdice have begun tapping into off-chain, Satoshi-funded gambling. Y’alls, a Yours-like blogging platform, is using Lightning payments for pay-per-view articles. Hungry? Lightning has that covered, as well, with Block and Jerry’s and Starblocks, crypto-couriers dishing out ice cream and coffee in exchange for LN micropayments (sadly, these services are not yet fully available).

This is just a sampling of an expanding list of LApps, and, if anything, the diversity of the applications currently in existence shows that the limits of what the Lightning Network can offer are confined to the imagination of the developers building on it. Bear in mind that, while these applications can run on either Bitcoin’s mainnet or testnet, their developers generally recommend that users stick to testnet payments until the Lightning Network’s kinks are ironed out. But with more than 1,000 nodes already supporting Lightning’s mainnet, it likely won’t be long until these, and other applications, can make the leap toward full functionality on Lightning Network’s growing architecture.",Technical,0.9676
2018/4/4,The History of Lightning: From Brainstorm to Beta,"As of a couple of weeks ago, the first Lightning implementation — lnd — is officially in beta. The second implementation — eclair — followed last week, while the third — c-lightning — is expected to do so soon. As such, the Lightning Network, the long-awaited Bitcoin overlay network for cheap and instant transactions, is by many of its developers considered safe enough to use on Bitcoin’s mainnet: a major milestone for the technology that has been years in the making.

This is the story so far.

The First Musings
The earliest origins of the Lightning Network can be traced back as far as Bitcoin itself.

The first piece of the Lightning puzzle is a concept called “payment channels.” Payment channels are essentially bitcoin balances between two Bitcoin users, and only two users: the rest of the world does not need to know or care about their mutual balances. Importantly, these balances can be updated without requiring any on-chain Bitcoin transactions; where the balance of one user increases, the balance of the other decreases by the same amount. In effect, this allows both participants to transact between each other, without burdening the entire network with their transaction data.

Once the users are done transacting, they can settle their payment channel by transmitting only one transaction to the network: that transaction pays out to each what they should receive based on their channel balances. To these users’ benefit, this should also mean that the channel updates (“off-chain transactions”) are cheaper because they don’t require mining fees, and are faster because they don’t require blockchain confirmations.

This general idea is arguably as old as the very first Bitcoin software released by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. Bitcoin 0.1 included a raw draft of code that would let users update a transaction before it was confirmed:

Payment Channel

While this code was a rough draft, Satoshi Nakamoto went into more detail about how payment channels could work in private communication with then-bitcoinj developer Mike Hearn.

Several years later, in 2013, Hearn published Satoshi Nakamoto’s explanation of payment channels on the Bitcoin-development mailing list:

The First Payment Channels
Although the general concept of payment channels has existed for as long as Bitcoin itself, Satoshi Nakamoto’s design was not entirely secure. Most importantly, a user in a payment channel could collude with miners to have an older transaction confirmed, claiming more bitcoin than the channel balance should let him.

A solution to this problem was proposed for the first time in the summer of 2011, after Satoshi Nakamoto had left the Bitcoin project. Bitcointalk forum user “hashcoin” outlined a two-tier payment channel that required users to exchange several partially signed multisignature transactions and transactions with timelocks that depended on one another to be valid. If one participant should disappear, the other could claim all the funds in the payment channel after some time had passed. A downside of this design, however, was that hashcoin's channels could only work in one direction. ""Alice"" could pay ""Bob"" an arbitrary number of times, but Bob could not pay Alice through the same channel.

An idea similar to hashcoin’s resurfaced in early 2013, and this time it escaped the theoretical realm. In April of that year, a payment channel concept was described by Jeremy Spilman on the Bitcoin-development mailing list. He had even coded up a proof of concept. This design was, in turn, tweaked by Mike Hearn, after which future Bitcoin Core contributor, Blockstream co-founder and Chaincode Labs developer Matt Corallo turned the concept into working code for bitcoinj by mid-2013.

Another year later, in 2014, Alex Akselrod (now an engineer at Lightning Labs) was the first to propose a bi-directional payment channel. Alice could pay Bob an arbitrary number of times, while, using decreasing timelocks, Bob could pay Alice within the same channel  — albeit a limited number of times. As opposed to one-directional payment channels, however, this solution was never actually implemented in code.

The First Payment Network Concepts
Around the same time that the first payment channels were proposed, others — including for example Bitcoin Core developers Peter Todd and Gavin Andresen — were thinking about off-chain payment networks. If Alice could pay Bob through an off-chain transaction, and Bob could pay Carol through an off-chain transaction, then Alice should be able to pay Carol through Bob without requiring any on-chain transactions.

Corné Plooy (now a Lightning developer at Dutch Bitcoin exchange BL3P) had also been working on a payment layer for Bitcoin, which he first proposed as a rough idea in 2011.


Plooy early payment layer

With suggestions added by Bitcoin Core developer and future Blockstream CTO Gregory Maxwell, and Ripple inventor Ryan Fugger (among others), this idea evolved throughout the years into a merger of Bitcoin and the original Ripple technology, resulting in the system Plooy called “Amiko Pay.” Earlier drafts of Amiko Pay did not utilize payment channels and therefore injected trust in the system, however: should one user refuse to settle a balance with another user, the latter would have no recourse.

An early payment network proposal that utilized payment channels was proposed by mathematician and future Bitcoin emBassy TLV co-founder Meni Rosenfeld in the summer of 2012. On the Bitcointalk forum, Rosenfeld described a system in which Bob (from the above example) is replaced by a payment processor, with both Alice and Carol as its customers. The payment processor could, in turn, also have channels with other payment processors, with more customers, turning the payment channel network into a hub-and-spoke system.

While such a system did introduce a little bit of trust in the payment processors — they could refuse to forward a payment and keep the money instead — this risk was considered small: the trick would only work for one payment before a customer would notice and stop using the channel. Additionally, bigger payments could be cut into smaller increments so that if one payment processor proved to be unreliable, only a small portion of the payment would be lost.

This solution resurfaced a couple of times throughout the years. Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd, for example, published the concept to the Bitcoin-development mailing list in 2014. Payment processor BitPay, meanwhile, published a white paper on similar inter-channel payments (“Impulse”) in early 2015. And a solution like this would actually be implemented by the Swedish startup Strawpay, called Stroem (or Ström), at around the same time — but none of these iterations ever took off in a meaningful way.

A relatively early attempt at establishing a trustless payment channel network was made by Alex Akselrod. First described in a wiki draft in 2013, to be implemented as a proof of concept throughout 2014, Akselrod’s solution went a long way toward solving the problem on a theoretical level. The main problem was that it would still be rather clunky in practice. If a payment were to fail anywhere along the route of a transaction, for example, a user would have no recourse but to wait until the funds were freed through the payment channel timelocks, which could potentially take months.

Meanwhile, by 2015, Plooy’s Amiko Pay had evolved to the point where it could potentially work trustlessly, too. However, his design would have required relatively far-reaching changes to the Bitcoin protocol, to the point where rolling back certain types of transactions would be necessary. While technically possible, it was not obvious whether such changes to the Bitcoin protocol would be adopted.

Later that same year, researchers from the technical university in Zurich (ETH Zurich), Dr. Christian Decker (now at Blockstream) and Roger Wattenhofer, proposed yet another overlay network design in their white paper “A Fast and Scalable Payment Network with Bitcoin Duplex Micropayment Channels.” Their solution relied strongly on timelocks as a sort of “countdown ticker” for payment channel validity, which was combined with a cryptographic trick called an “invalidation tree” for expired channel balances.

Akselrod’s solution, the later drafts of Amiko Pay, and Duplex Micropayment Channels (DMCs) were all similar to the Lightning Network in some ways, and could have worked in their own right by making different trade-offs. If the Lightning Network had not been invented, any of these solutions might have become (the basis of) Bitcoin’s go-to scaling layer instead.

But of course, the Lightning Network was invented.

The Lightning Network
After years of payment channel and network design evolution, all the pieces of the puzzle finally fell together in early 2015.

Thaddeus “Tadge” Dryja — the CTO of smart contract trading platform Mirror — and Joseph Poon wrote a white paper titled “The Bitcoin Lightning Network: Scalable Off-Chain Instant Payments,” first published in February of that year.

It proved to be a game-changer.

The Lightning Network white paper, as this publication came to be referred to, proposed several solutions to realize a payment channel network completely trustlessly: no participants could cheat without risking all the money they put up in their channel, while middlemen forwarding transactions would be unable to steal even a tiny bit of it. Additionally, the solution required relatively few changes to the Bitcoin protocol and promised to be more flexible and user-friendly than the alternatives proposed so far.

The key innovation described in the white paper are “Poon-Dryja channels”. Like earlier payment channel designs, Poon-Dryja channels depend on the exchange of partially signed and non-broadcasted transactions. But compared to previous payment channels, these new channels take an additional step involving the exchange of secret numbers, which allow payment channels to be updated in either “direction.” Alice can pay Bob an arbitrary number of times, and Bob can pay Alice within the same channel an equally arbitrary number of times.

Additionally, the Lightning Network leverages Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLCs). This concept is usually attributed to Tier Nolan and was originally designed for cross-blockchain transactions; for example, to exchange bitcoin and litecoin trustlessly. In the Lightning Network, this solution is instead used to link payments across payment channels.

Poon and Dryja first presented their idea publicly at the San Francisco Bitcoin Devs Seminar in February 2015:



In the months thereafter, during the spring and summer of 2015, Bitcoin’s scaling issue and the block-size-limit dispute turned into a public feud. In the midst of this crisis atmosphere, a series of two conferences was organized for late 2015: Scaling Bitcoin Montreal in September and Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong in December. In Montreal, Poon and Dryja presented their proposal once again, then both Poon and Dryja gave a second, more in-depth presentation in Hong Kong as well.

Right after this second edition of the conference in Hong Kong, Gregory Maxwell proposed a scaling road map on the Bitcoin-development mailing list. This road map prominently included the Lightning Network. It gained support from the majority of Bitcoin’s technical community and became the de facto road map for the Bitcoin Core project.

If anticipation for the Lightning Network wasn’t big enough already, it certainly was now.

The Implementations
The Lightning Network white paper is a long and complex document, covering highly technical concepts; in 2015, few people had the time and skill to read through and understand it. But general understanding increased significantly when long-time Linux kernel developer Rusty Russell learned about the white paper. In a series of blog posts published in early 2015, Russell “translated” the proposal for a more general (but still quite technical) audience.

Then, in May of 2015, Russell was hired by blockchain development company Blockstream to develop an actual implementation of Lightning in the C programming language: c-lightning. This major step toward implementation proved pivotal. A concept that had only been proposed a couple of months prior was now in the process of being realized by a world-class developer. Russell was later joined by Christian Decker at Blockstream, while other developers — including Corné Plooy — would, over the next couple of years, contribute to the open-source project as well.

Soon after Russell started working on c-lightning, Blockstream was no longer the only company to realize a Lightning implementation. By the summer of 2015, ACINQ, a smaller Bitcoin technology company that had originally planned to develop smart-card-based hardware wallets, decided to try their hand at the promising technology as well. The Paris-based startup would later announce that it had developed its own implementation of the Lightning protocol in the Scala programming language, named eclair.

Another couple of months down the road, a third implementation was in the works. By January 2016, both of the Lightning Network white paper authors, Poon and Dryja, together with Elizabeth Stark and Olaoluwa “Laolu” Osuntokun, founded a whole new company to develop Lightning: Lightning Labs. Lightning Labs would spearhead development on lnd, an implementation of Lightning in Google’s Go programming language (also known as “golang”), which they had already started developing before founding the company.

About one year after founding the company, in late 2016, Dryja left Lightning Labs to instead join MIT Media Lab’s Digital Currency Initiative, the same organization that employs Bitcoin Core lead developer Wladimir van der Laan and several other Bitcoin Core contributors. At MIT, Dryja continued to work on the Lightning implementation he bootstrapped at Lightning Labs, which he renamed lit; both lnd and lit exist today. Lit differentiates itself from lnd and other implementations by being a wallet and a node wrapped into one; today, it also supports multiple coins simultaneously through a configuration option.

Additionally, blockchain company Bitfury, best known for its mining pool and mining hardware, forked the lnd implementation to yet another version of the software. Unique to this fork is that it made trade-offs in the design so as not to require a malleability fix on the Bitcoin network — more on that later. Bitfury also made contributions in the realm of transaction routing, most notably in the form of a protocol called “Flare.” (Development of the Bitfury fork of lnd appears to have stalled for now, however.)

Further, in 2016, major wallet provider Blockchain announced that it developed a simplified version of the Lightning Network called thunder. This implementation made relatively big trade-offs compared to typical Lightning implementations, most notably because it required trust in counterparties on the network. By making this trade-off, it was able to launch an alpha release of its implementation as early as spring of 2016, long before any other development team. (While thunder might also be made compatible with the Lightning Network in the future, development of this implementation appears to have stalled for now, as well.)

In the days right after Scaling Bitcoin Milan, the third edition of the conference organized in late 2016, contributors to most Lightning implementations gathered for what came to be referred to as the first Lightning Summit. Here, they discussed how to make all of the different implementations interoperable, resulting in a Lightning Network protocol specification dubbed “BOLT” (an acronym for Basis of Lightning Technology). Where the Lightning Network white paper was a theoretical proposal, BOLT became the basis of the actual Lightning Network as we know it today.

The Protocol Changes
When the Lightning Network white paper was first published, the idea described was actually not compatible with the Bitcoin protocol — at least not securely. To enable the Lightning Network as described, Bitcoin required several protocol changes.

The first of these were new timelocks that would make payment channels resistant to Bitcoin’s malleability bug. This problem was already in the process of being solved even before the publication of the Lightning Network white paper, however, and was conclusively solved in 2015, when a new type of timelock designed and proposed by Peter Todd was implemented in the Bitcoin protocol: CheckLockTimeVerify (CLTV).

Later, Bitcoin Core developers realized that the Lightning Network would function even better with relative timelocks. These allow users to lock bitcoins up for a specific point of time after another transaction has been confirmed. In the context of Lightning, users can keep their payment channels open indefinitely, whereas CLTV timelocks require them to close their channels periodically. A soft fork upgrade to realize relative timelocks, called CheckSequenceVerify (CSV), was designed by Bitcoin Core contributors BtcDrak, Eric Lombrozo and Mark Friedenbach, and activated on the Bitcoin network by the summer of 2016.

But the biggest protocol change that the Lightning Network required (at least assuming a decent user experience), was a malleability fix for any Bitcoin transaction.

At the time of the publication of the Lightning Network white paper, malleability was considered a big challenge. While a soft fork draft to fix it was in progress at the time, developers weren’t sure this could work and thought it might require a hard fork instead. Then, by late 2015, Bitcoin Core contributors realized that Segregated Witness (SegWit), a malleability fix that was part of Blockstream’s Elements Project, could be deployed on Bitcoin as a backward-compatible soft fork.

After a long struggle, the Segregated Witness soft fork finally activated in the summer of 2017, paving the way for the Lightning Network on Bitcoin as well.

(For more on the history of Segregated Witness, also see “The Long Road to SegWit: How Bitcoin’s Biggest Protocol Upgrade Became Reality.”)

The Alpha
Even while Segregated Witness had yet to be deployed on the Bitcoin protocol (and it was not completely certain that it ever would), development of the Lightning Network was well under way.

This started on testnet, the Bitcoin copy specifically designed for testing purposes. Or more accurately, in this case, the Lightning Network started on a dedicated version of testnet, dubbed “SegNet 4” (it was the fourth SegWit-specific testnet), launched in May of 2016.

Less than six months after the deployment of SegNet 4, in October 2016, the Blockstream development team had advanced its c-lightning prototype to the point where it was usable. In what was referred to as “Lightning First Strike,” Decker had “bought” a cat picture from Russell using testnet bitcoins over an early iteration of the Lightning Network.

Lightning Cats

By January 2017, the first Lightning implementation — lnd — was released in alpha. With that, the Lightning Network itself had “officially” entered into its “alpha stage”: developers from around the world were, for the first time, invited to experiment with the technology, while Lightning Labs would continue to help test and improve the code.

This alpha phase, in turn, led to a growing number of developers building applications on top of lnd and other Lightning implementations. These “Lapps,” as Lightning implementations have come to be called, ranged from desktop and mobile wallets, to micropayment blogging platforms, to gambling sites, to explorers, and much more — though, in most cases, still designed for Bitcoin’s testnet.

During the summer of 2017, Segregated Witness finally activated, and the groundwork for the Lightning Network on Bitcoin was completed. From then, it took Blockstream about three months to announce its first transaction on Bitcoin’s mainnet. A little later, in November, Lightning Labs made its first Lightning transaction across blockchains: from Bitcoin to Litecoin. And in December, development teams from Blockstream, Lightning Labs and ACINQ announced that they had performed successful interoperability tests.

Moreover, by the end of the year, others started to actually use the alpha Lightning implementations on Bitcoin’s mainnet with real money — in some cases even against recommendations of its developers. A growing number of Lightning channels were opened, and by December developer Alex Bosworth had paid his phone bill through a Lightning channel he had set up with payment processor Bitrefill: one of the first real-money purchases over the Lightning Network ever.

Another month later, Blockstream — while the c-lightning implementation was still in beta — opened a webshop where real products could be bought with real bitcoins, albeit with a clear warning of the risks involved. And in February 2018, in an almost poetic closure of Lightning’s alpha stage, Bitcoin’s legendary Lazlo Hanyecz of “Bitcoin pizza” fame announced that he’d bought pizzas (of course!) through the Lightning Network.

The Beta
After years of development, and even more years of conceptualization, perhaps the biggest milestone of all was reached several weeks ago.

Midway through March 2018, Lightning Labs’ lnd was the first Lightning implementation to be released in beta. Announced simultaneously with a $2.5 million seed investment round, which included big-name investors like Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Lightning Labs deemed the Lightning implementation it had been spearheading ready for use on Bitcoin’s mainnet — though primarily for technical users.

This announcement was followed by a tweet from ACINQ on March 28, announcing that eclair had also been released in beta and was thus deemed ready for mainnet use, as well. The startup added that their Android Lightning wallet would be released the following week. (At the time of publication of this article, that is this week.)

Blockstream’s c-lightning implementation has not yet been released in beta, though its development team indicated to Bitcoin Magazine this may follow shortly, too. Adding to a still-growing list, the blockchain development company did, however, introduce seven brand-new Lapps in the last week of March, highlighting the company’s progress on the Lightning front.

While people were already using Lightning software even in alpha, the beta phase has only further stimulated this growth. At the time of publication of this article, well over 1,000 Lightning nodes have opened up almost 5,000 payment channels, holding over 10 bitcoin (some $70,000 at the time of writing) in aggregate. Hundreds of new nodes are coming online every day, and even a Litecoin-specific Lightning Network is taking shape, which could, in the future, be made interoperable with Bitcoin’s.

Yet, even with all this progress, it’s still early days for the Lightning Network. Most users of the network today are still very technical (often developers), and use cases are mostly experimental. While the beta software release(s) are major milestones, development and improvement of the network is an ongoing process, and much still needs to be done, while open questions on routing, privacy and other risks remain.

Most likely, only further adoption will answer them.

Author’s note: While doing research for this article, I came to realize that the full (pre)history of the Lightning Network is even more extensive than I already knew it was. Outlining it into a single piece required cutting corners and leaving out details, which does not do justice to all the people, projects and concepts that help(ed) realize this technology. This article is an attempt at outlining the story so far, but it is best understood as a rough summary — not an exhaustive historic or technical account.

2018/4/6,First Lightning Network Wallet App Now Available via Google Play,"The Lightning Network’s first mobile app for Bitcoin’s mainnet is now available through Google Play. Known as the Eclair Wallet, the app was released on April 4, 2018, via French technology startup ACINQ, and is being offered specifically to Android users.

Devices employing software version 5.0 or higher can send Lightning payments, which require significantly lower fees than the standard Bitcoin network. Transactions also happen much faster compared to on-chain confirmations.

Describing the new product on GitHub, ACINQ wrote:

“The Eclair Wallet is a next-generation, Lightning-ready Bitcoin wallet. It can be used as a regular Bitcoin wallet, and can also connect to the Lightning Network for cheap and instant payments. This software is based upon eclair [another Lightning implementation], and follows the Lightning Network standard.”

The product’s release marks the latest in a long list of items that have come by way of the Lightning Network over the past several weeks. In March, for example, the protocol’s “first Lightning mainnet release,” known as Ind 0.4-beta, went live to widespread acclaim. Several other new tools have since entered the market by way of private developers, and an upcoming beta known as c-lightning is expected to be available relatively soon.

The Lightning Network on Bitcoin is made possible in part due to Segregated Witness, the protocol upgrade that activated on Bitcoin last summer. The app’s popularity has also inspired users to request an iOS edition of the product.

The wallet does, however, come with certain limitations. According to a description written by ACINQ, “Lightning channels are outbound only: you can pay with LN but you cannot receive or forward payments with this wallet.” It further states that if users wish to enjoy the full LN experience, they are advised to run a full Eclair node.

The Lightning Network is described as a “peer-to-peer system” working as a “second-layer payment protocol” leveraging the security of Bitcoin’s blockchain to process (micro)payments. The Network’s scalability should allow it to process millions to billions of transactions per second across the network.

Founded in 2014, ACINQ is based in Paris, and seeks to build “products and services for the Bitcoin ecosystem.”",Technical,0.34
2018/4/7,Monero Just Hard Forked — and It Resulted in Four New Projects,"One hard fork later, there are four new Monero projects.

Privacy-centric cryptocurrency Monero hard forked to version 12 of its protocol yesterday. But not everyone is on board. Following the example once set by Ethereum Classic, some users are continuing on the pre-hard fork Monero blockchain… though in this case not as a single project. Now there is  Monero Classic (XMC), Monero 0 (XMZ), Monero Original (XMO) and a second project by the name Monero Classic (XMC) (which in this article we will refer to as Monero-Classic); these are all continuing on version 11 of the Monero protocol. Of course, this means they are all still compatible on a single network, using the same coin — just with different names.

Here’s the story of the pre-hard fork Monero blockchain and the four different projects keeping it alive.

The Hard Fork
As an ongoing protocol upgrade process, Monero has made a habit of hard forking once every six months. The latest hard fork introduced several new features, including an increased ring-size for more private but also bigger (thus more resource-intensive) transactions, multi-signature transactions, initial Ledger Nano S hardware wallet support, and more.

The latest hard fork also introduced a tweak to Monero’s CryptoNight proof-of-work hashing algorithm. This backwards-incompatible change makes all existing ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) mining hardware useless. Such specialized hardware is a bigger concern on the CryptoNight hashing algorithm than most other hashing algorithms, as it could let ASIC miners launch denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on non-ASIC miners and non-mining nodes on the network.

The risks presented by ASIC-mining hardware appeared to be reason why at least most of Monero’s development and user community agreed on the change. However, not all parties were equally happy with the hard fork, presumably. Most notably, major hardware manufacturer Bitmain, as well as smaller manufacturers Halong Mining and PinIdea, recently all announced that they had developed ASIC machines for the CryptoNight hashing algorithm (and such hardware was probably used to mine on the Monero blockchain in secret). All this hardware would be rendered mostly worthless after Monero’s hard fork.

Now, over the past couple of days and weeks, four projects have announced that they will continue to use the pre-hard fork Monero protocol. Since all four are using the same protocol, they are (at least as far as we can tell) really all the same network and coin, albeit with different names and logos.

These are the four new projects continuing the pre-hard fork Monero blockchain.

Four new Monero projects ... and then there's, well, Monero.


Monero Classic (XMC)
This first, Monero Classic, is initiated by a group that self-identifies as Monero enthusiasts from Singapore — including developers and “a few” miners — who felt it was “time to take action.” Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, representative Bento Tan explained that he believes that the development of ASICs is a healthy, market-driven process.

He said:

“The ability to have choices promotes competition and that drives growth. We have to look at things at that level. Unilateral control is a suffocating death because you take away the need to improve and innovate.”

Tan added that he considers this healthy market dynamic to be confirmed by the fact there are three different manufacturers to have created ASICs — not just one.

Further, hard-forking to make mining hardware obsolete is a considered a bigger risk than the risk of mining centralization. A statement on the Monero Classic website reads:

“The main message of Monero Classic is that we believe that the developers changing the proof of work creates more centralization and harms decentralization.” And: “The M[o]nero developers are saying that they can and will change the consensus rules whenever it suits them and the community seems to be conditioned into following the wishes of the developers.”

Monero Classic has no connections with any of the other new Monero projects, Tan said, and has no plans to cooperate with them.

Monero-Classic (XMC)
On the project website, the person behind Monero-Classic identifies himself as “PZ, an early Bitcoin evangelist and blockchain eco builder”. (You can read more about PZ here.)

Not unlike (the other) Monero Classic, PZ explains on this website that “the emergence of specialized mining machine[s] for a cryptocurrency is [a] normal market economy phenomenon.” Additionally, PZ argues that “if there are professional mining machines, the events like ‘Monero was attacked by more than 500,000 botnets’ could be avoided,” referring to botnets that have been used to mine Monero.

Since the project seems to have originated from China, is actively promoted by Bitmain’s mining pool AntPool, and of course because Bitmain has much to gain from a continuation of Monero with the CryptoNight hash algorithm, some suspect that this ASIC hardware manufacturer has a hand in this project, too. However, when asked by Bitcoin Magazine, a Bitmain representative suggested this was not the case.

Bitcoin Magazine was unable to get in contact with PZ or anyone else from the Monero-Classic project by time of publication.

Monero 0 (XMZ)
Speaking with Bitcoin Magazine, a pseudonymous spokesperson for Monero 0 identified the group as one of “concerned users” and ""proof-of-work maximalists,” some of whom operate hobby operations for mining.

On the project website, Monero 0 writes:

“We’ve decided that the Monero Project’s strategy to continuously hard fork is no longer a stable or a sane strategy. We believe that Satoshi’s Proof of Work is the only mechanism for decentralized consensus. The so-called ‘network upgrades’ that are centrally mandated by the Monero Project are a Trojan Horse designed to compromise the effectiveness of Proof of Work in the Monero network. Monero 0 is not a fork; it is the original Monero.”

The Monero 0 spokesperson further said that Monero is ""an NVDA project"", that “‘proof of fork’ is not a consensus method,” and that “Bitmain is trying to destroy Monero” — but did not have time to explain more.

Monero Original (XMO)
Not much is known about Monero Original or the people behind it.

The project has a GitHub, and it sent press releases to several outlets. This press release did not contain much information, but it did include a statement from the “lead developer of Monero Original team”:

“Monero has always been about freedom of choice, about diversity and about the strong community behind it. We are providing the Monero fans [with] a possibility to support the iconic coin and stay on the original chain. Monero Original team stands for diversity, which is a logical marker of evolution. We are excited to see our favourite coin mature, and we are even more excited to help [in] keeping this diversity.""

At least one cryptocurrency exchange — HitBTC — indicated it would make XMO balances available to all XMR holders at the time of the hard fork. This does not necessarily mean that HitBTC will also offer XMO trading, but it does make it more likely they will.

Bitcoin Magazine reached out to the Monero Original project but did not receive any response by the time of publication.

The Complications
So far, it appears that both the new Monero blockchain and the pre-hard fork blockchain are being mined. Most hash power is still on the pre-hard fork blockchain, and both are supported by less hash power than they were before the hard fork. This means that blocks are being found more slowly, in particular on the new Monero blockchain, but this situation should stabilize within days.

Assuming that at least one of the four new projects succeeds in keeping the pre-hard fork Monero blockchain running (and assuming the new Monero blockchain keeps running too), this could lead to some complications.

For one, the Monero hard fork did not implement replay protection. This could mean that users who spend XMR on the new Monero blockchain could unintentionally spend the equivalent coins on the pre-hard fork blockchain, and vice versa.

Thanks to other changes on the new Monero protocol, this risk appears limited for users of the pre-hard fork blockchain, however. The default transactions they make will be considered invalid on the new Monero protocol. But users of the new Monero blockchain do not have that same luck. If they want to keep their pre-hard fork coins, they should move these before they move their XMR, and do so with the default ring-size of five (or six).

Over time, replay attacks should become less likely, even for users that didn’t move their coins. This is because on Monero, mixing coins is a requirement, and the odds that users will mix their coins with coins that are only valid on one chain will increase. Doing so will make the whole transaction invalid on one of both chains.

A bigger problem is that moving coins on both blockchains independently reveals which coins are controlled by the same user. This is at odds with Monero’s central value proposition of privacy and fungibility. Therefore, anyone who uses Monero for privacy reasons is best advised to completely choose one chain and ignore the other. (It’s presumably best to ignore the chain that carries the least value.)

Even users that do not use both chains may suffer from somewhat decreased privacy. If they mix their coins with users who revealed which coins they own, it can reduce the anonymity set of the users that did not. This added risk is probably compensated for on the new Monero protocol by the increased ring-size for transactions, however.

Whether the pre-hard fork version of Monero (in the form of the four different projects) will gain and retain any market value of course remains to be seen.

Monero lead developer Riccardo Spagni did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.

Update April 7th: It appears there is a fifth project on the pre-hard fork Monero blockchain: MoneroC. Additionally, trading of XMO has by now commenced on HitBTC. At the time of writing this update, one XMO trades for 0.00175 BTC, which is about $12, or 0.07 XMR, but the price is very volatile. Some minor details were updated in the rest of the article as well.

2018/6/4,The Genesis Files: Hashcash or How Adam Back Designed Bitcoin’s Motor Block,"The date is March 28, 1997, when the 2,000-or-so subscribers of the Cypherpunks mailing list receive an email with the above header in their inbox. The sender is a 26-year-old British postdoc at the University of Exeter, a young cryptographer and prolific contributor to the mailing list named Dr. Adam Back. The email includes a description and early implementation of what he describes as a “partial hash collision based postage scheme” — a sort of stamp equivalent for emails, based on a nifty cryptographic trick.

“The idea of using partial hashes is that they can be made arbitrarily expensive to compute,” wrote Back, explaining the advantage of his system, “and yet can be verified instantly.”

This proposal by the cryptographer who would go on to become the current Blockstream CEO did not immediately garner much attention on the email list; just one reader responded, with a technical inquiry about the hashing algorithm of choice. Yet, the technology underlying Hashcash — proof of work — would shape research into digital money for more than a decade to come.

“Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail”
Back’s Hashcash was actually not the first solution of its kind.

By the early 1990s, the promise of the internet, and the advantages of an electronic mailing system in particular, had become obvious to techies paying attention. Still, internet pioneers of the day came to realize that email, as this electronic mailing system was called, presented its own challenges.

“In particular, the easy and low cost of sending electronic mail, and in particular the simplicity of sending the same message to many parties, all but invite abuse,” IBM researchers Dr. Cynthia Dwork and Dr. Moni Naor explained in their 1992 white paper bearing the name “Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail.”

Indeed, as email rose in popularity, so did spam.

A solution was needed, early internet users agreed — and a solution is what Dwork and Naor’s paper offered.

The duo proposed a system where senders would have to attach some data to any email they send. This data would be the solution to a math problem, unique to the email in question. Specifically, Dwork and Naor proposed three candidate puzzles that could be used for the purpose, all based on public-key cryptography and signature schemes.

Adding a solution to an email wouldn’t be too difficult, ideally requiring only a couple of seconds of processing power from a regular computer, while its validity could easily be checked by the recipient. But, and this is the trick, even a trivial amount of processing power per email adds up for advertisers, scammers and hackers trying to send thousands or even millions of messages at once. Spamming, so was the theory, could be made expensive and, therefore, unprofitable.

“The main idea is to require a user to compute a moderately hard, but not intractable, function in order to gain access to the resource, thus preventing frivolous use,” Dwork and Naor explained.

While Dwork and Naor did not propose the term, the type of solution they introduced would become known as a “proof of work” system. Users would have to literally show that their computer performed work, to prove that they spent real-world resources.

A nifty solution, but perhaps too far ahead of its time. The proposal never made it very far beyond a relatively small circle of computer scientists.

Adam Back and the Cypherpunks
Around the same time that Dwork and Naor published their white paper, a group of privacy activists with a libertarian bent came to recognize the enormous potential of the internet as well. The ideologically driven crowd started to organize through a mailing list centred around privacy-enhancing technologies. Like Dwork and Naor, these “Cypherpunks” — as they would come to be called — utilized the relatively new science of cryptography to work toward their goals.

Over the years, Adam Back — who earned his Ph.D. in 1996 — established himself as one of the more active participants on this list, at times contributing dozens of emails in a single month. Like most Cypherpunks, the cryptographer was passionate about topics including privacy, free speech and libertarianism, and engaged in technical discussions pertaining to anonymous remailers, encrypted file systems, electronic cash as introduced by Dr. David Chaum, and more.

But for a while, Back was perhaps best known for printing and selling “munition” shirts: T-shirts with an encryption protocol printed on them, intended to help point out the absurd decision by the U.S. government to regulate Phil Zimmermann’s PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption program as “munitions” within the definition of the U.S. export regulations. Wearing Back’s shirt while crossing the border to exit the United States technically made you a “munitions exporter.”

munitions tshirt


Like many, Back was not aware of Dwork and Naor’s proof-of-work proposal. But by the mid-1990s, he was thinking of similar ideas to counter spam, sometimes “out loud” on the Cypherpunks mailing list.

“A side benefit of using PGP, is that PGP encryption should add some overhead to the spammer — he can probably encrypt less messages per second than he can spam down a T3 link,” Back commented, for example, in the context of adding more privacy to remailers; an idea somewhat similar to Dwork and Naor’s.

The Cypherpunks mailing list grew significantly in about half a decade. What started out as an online discussion platform for a group of people that initially gathered at one of their startups in the Bay Area became a small internet phenomenon with thousands of subscribers — and often more emails on a single day than anyone could reasonably keep track of.

It was around this time — 1997, close to the list’s peak popularity — that Back submitted his Hashcash proposal.

Hashcash
Hashcah is similar to Dwork and Naor’s anti-spam proposal and has the same purpose, though Back proposed some additional use cases like countering anonymous remailer abuse. But as the name suggests, Hashcash was not based on cryptographic puzzles like Dwork and Naor’s; it was based on hashing.

Hashing is a cryptographic trick that takes any data — whether it’s a single letter or an entire book — and turns it into a seemingly random number of predetermined length.

For example, a SHA-256 hash of the sentence This is a sentence produces this hexadecimal number:
hash1


Which can be “translated” to the regular decimal number:

hash2


Or to binary:

hash binary


Meanwhile, a SHA-256 hash of the sentence This, is a sentence produces this hexadecimal number:

hash3


As you can see, merely inserting one comma into the sentence completely changes the hash. And, importantly, what the hash of either sentence would be was completely unpredictable; even after the first sentence was hashed, there was no way to calculate the second hash from it. The only way to find out was to actually hash both sentences.

Hashcash applies this mathematical trick in a clever way.

With Hashcash, the metadata of an email (the “from” address, the “to” address, the time, etc.) is formalized as a protocol. Additionally, the sender of an email must add a random number to this metadata: a “nonce.” All this metadata, including the nonce, is then hashed, so the resulting hash looks a bit like one of the random numbers above.

Here’s the trick: not every hash is considered “valid.” Instead, the binary version of the hash must start with a predetermined number of zeroes. For example: 20 zeroes. The sender can generate a hash that starts with 20 zeroes by including a nonce that randomly adds up correctly … but the sender can’t know in advance what that nonce will look like.

To generate a valid hash, therefore, the sender has only one option: trial and error (“brute force”). He must keep trying different nonces until he finds a valid combination; otherwise, his email will be rejected by the intended recipient’s email client. Like Dwork and Naor’s solution, this requires computational resources: it’s a proof-of-work system.

“[I]f it hasn’t got a 20 bit hash […] you have a program which bounces it with a notice explaining the required postage, and where to obtain software from,” Back explained on the Cypherpunks mailing list. “This would put spammers out of business overnight, as 1,000,000 x 20 = 100 MIP years which is going to be more compute than they've got.”

Notably, Back’s proof-of-work system is more random than Dwork and Naor’s. The duo’s solution required solving a puzzle, meaning that a faster computer would solve it faster than a slow computer every time. But statistically, Hashcash would still allow for the slower computer to find a correct solution faster some of the time.

(By analogy, if one person runs faster than another person, the former will win a sprint between them every time. But if one person buys more lottery tickets than another person, the latter will statistically still win some of the time — just not as often.)

Digital Scarcity
Like Dwork and Naor’s proposal, Hashcash — which Back would elaborate on in a white paper in 2002 — never took off in a very big way. It was implemented in Apache’s open-source SpamAssassin platform, and Microsoft gave the proof-of-work idea a spin in the incompatible “email postmark” format. And Back, as well as other academics, came up with various alternative applications for the solution over the years, but most of these never gained much traction. For most potential applications, the lack of any network effect was probably too big to overcome.

Nevertheless, Dwork and Naor as well as Back (independently) did introduce something new. Where one of the most powerful features of digital products is the ease with which they can be copied, proof of work was essentially the first concept akin to virtual scarcity that didn’t rely on a central party: it tied digital data to the real-world, limited resource of computing power.

And scarcity, of course, is a prerequisite for money. Indeed, Back in particular explicitly placed Hashcash in the category of money throughout his Cypherpunks mailing list contributions and white paper, mirroring it to the only digital cash the world had seen at that point in time: DigiCash’s Ecash by Chaum.

“Hashcash may provide a stop gap measure until digicash becomes more widely used,” Back argued on the mailing list. “Hashcash is free, all you’ve got to do is burn some cycles on your PC. It is in keeping with net culture of free discourse, where the financially challenged can duke it out with millionaires, retired government officials, etc on equal terms. [And] Hashcash may provide us with a fall back method for controling [sic] spam if digicash goes sour (gets outlawed or required to escrow user identities).”

Despite the name, however, Hashcash couldn’t properly function as a full-fledged cash in itself (nor could Dwork and Naor’s proposal). Perhaps most importantly, any “received” proof of work is useless to the recipient. Unlike money, it could not be re-spent elsewhere. On top of that, as computers increased in speed every year, they could produce more and more proofs over time at lower cost: Hashcash would have been subject to (hyper)inflation.

What proof of work did offer, more than anything else, was a new basis for research in the digital-money realm. Several of the most notable digital-money proposals that followed were building on Hashcash, typically by allowing the proofs of work to be reused. (With Hal Finney’s Reusable Proof of Work — RPOW — as the most obvious example.)

Bitcoin
Ultimately, of course, proof of work became a cornerstone for Bitcoin, with Hashcash as one of the few citations in the Bitcoin white paper.

Yet, in Bitcoin, Hashcash (or, rather, a version of it) is utilized very differently than many would have guessed beforehand. Unlike Hashcash and other Hashcash-based proposals, the scarcity it provides is not itself used as money at all. Instead, Hashcash enables a race. Whichever miner is the first to produce a valid proof of work — a hash of a Bitcoin block — gets to decide which transactions go through. At least in theory, anyone can compete equally: much like a lottery, even small miners would statistically be the first to produce a valid proof of work every so often.

Further, once a new block is mined, confirming a set of transactions, these transactions are unlikely to be reversed. An attacker would have to prove at least as much work as required to find the block in the first place, adding up for every additional block that is found, which under normal circumstances becomes exponentially harder over time. The real-world resources that must be spent in order to cheat typically outweigh the potential profit that can be made by cheating, giving recipients of Bitcoin transactions confidence that these transactions are final.

This is how, in Bitcoin, Hashcash killed two birds with one stone. It solved the double-spending problem in a decentralized way, while providing a trick to get new coins into circulation with no centralized issuer.

Hashcash did not realize the first electronic cash system — Ecash takes that crown, and proof-of-work could not really function as money. But a decentralized electronic cash system might well have been impossible without it.

2018/6/8,"To Better Organize, Decentralize: Matan Field of DAOstack","It’s time to move past the inefficiency of antiquated organizational structures, and blockchains are the key. So say the creators of DAOstack, a solution that’s designed to intuitively move people into systems of decentralized governance and away from the traditional top-down hierarchies that predominate the planet today.

DAOstack CEO Matan Field was the featured guest on Episode #237 of Epicenter, joining hosts Brian Fabian Crain and Sébastien Couture for a deep dive into his personal journey with, and considerable ambitions for, the company he co-founded. It’s the second act in the world of Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) design for this theoretical physicist, who originally set out to combine the blockchain and decentralization with the short-lived company Backfeed.

Realizing in the midst of Backfeed that both a technological partner and a revised focus were necessary, the company stopped operations. Field hit reset, and the result was DAOstack, a platform for decentralized governance which allows collectives to self-organize, gathering with relative ease and efficiency over their shared goals and values.

Unpacking the Stack
In conversation with Crain and Couture, Field described how the primary appeal of DAOstack crystallizes around its concept as a “WordPress for DAOs.” 

Evolved from open-source origins, WordPress provides website creators with a set of backend tools that make it relatively simple to design, launch and grow an extremely wide array of websites, from simple blogging to full-blown media portals and e-commerce operations.

Thousands of plugins and themes are available to further customize a WordPress site and make it suit an individual organization’s unique needs.

“When I say that you establish and operate a DAO easily, like you would a blog in WordPress,” Field says in the interview, “the meaning is that you have a framework of rules for coordination of people. If I want to establish a new DAO with its own rules, its own governance protocol, I don’t have to code that from scratch.”

The idea that this WordPress workflow can be applied to enabling DAOs is compelling, to say the least. It makes the massive challenge of taking on ancient systems of hierarchical management seem achievable, even user-friendly. That’s key if Fields’ vision of enabling decentralized infrastructures — for everything from governments to hedge funds, insurance companies, coding collectives and climate change warriors — is going to see significant adoption.

From there, users who get drawn in will discover what makes this system a “stack,” built as it is on a modular Ethereum-based smart contract framework (“Arc”); a JavaScript developer environment (“Arc.js”); and an intuitive user interface designed to encourage participation (“Alchemy”) even by the non-technically inclined.

In Practice       
Need a use case of a deployment where the user-friendly DAOstack can make a positive impact? Field provides one with the Ethereum project itself which, in his estimation, has abundant financial and human capital (in the form of thousands of developers).

“So what is the limiting factor in producing solutions? Why haven’t we solved the scalability problem?” he posits. “The actual answer is the decision-making capacity to wisely deploy capital into human capital and produce solutions. That’s exactly the role for Alchemy: decentralizing the decision-making function, so that people can get into the system, and they can make any proposal to use funds. People can vote on a proposal and produce decisions in large numbers, effectively.”

GENESIS Is Next
The rollout of DAOstack took another step with the public sale in May of GEN, which is the native crypto token of DAOstack’s ecosystem. Meanwhile, there is a Q3 2018 release scheduled for the GENESIS DAO, which will be open to public participation as it marks the first DAO created using this stack.

How will it fare? Doubtless, Field and his colleagues will patiently be on pins and needles as they watch it unfold, informed as they were by their Backfeed experience which showed them that infrastructures require time to evolve.

No matter how it pans out, however, his experiment bears out a truth noted by Crain at the podcast’s conclusion: “Finding new ways of collaborating, organizing and building structures and organizational systems is one of the most exciting aspects of blockchain.”",Technical,0.4404
2018/6/13,Op Ed: Scaling Capital Market Adoption of Blockchain Technology With SHA-3,"The shift has already started; finance is moving onto the blockchain, leveraging the decentralization and disintermediation benefits of the technology’s architecture.

Assets of all kinds are being moved to the blockchain, creating a more efficient and economical system for the transfer of value, and management of fractional ownership. This migration isn’t just disrupting the existing financial system, it’s democratizing access to growth capital across the world.

Today, security for much of the blockchain community relies on an outdated hash algorithm standard (SHA-2), one not best suited to the needs of the demanding financial markets. Existing chains will eventually need to upgrade to what our team has determined to be the best-in-class cryptographic hash function, SHA-3, but new blockchains should implement it now.

These are the very early days of putting securities on the blockchain. As leaders in crypto-securities and blockchain technologies for the capital markets, we must be thoughtful about how we facilitate this transfer of assets; we must ensure that we operate in such a way that lays the groundwork for long-term security and sets a standard for industry best practices. Implementing the best-in-class cryptographic hash function, Secure Hash Algorithm-3 (SHA-3), serves this mission.

The Hash Function
Blockchain technology is disrupting the data management industry. Peer-to-peer networks have promoted the use of cryptography, creating a growing demand in data security and transparency solutions.

A cryptographic hash function is an algorithm that employs mathematics to create a unique digital fingerprint of alphanumeric characters of a fixed size, given an input document of unknown size. This makes the task of comparing the authenticity of a document with an original very simple: Instead of having to read both documents in detail, we can simply compare the much smaller digital fingerprint produced by the hash function.

In peer-to-peer networks, hash functions help secure transaction data by generating a unique digital fingerprint for each transaction. Transaction hashes are organized into a Merkle tree (a.k.a. a hash tree) to help validate the authenticity and relationship of each transaction stored on the blockchain.

The SHA-3 hash function is also used at the block level to generate a proof-of-work challenge that becomes the target for miners seeking to create the next block on the blockchain. This challenge is an important part of how the network maintains its integrity and reaches a decentralized consensus. Cryptocurrency is awarded to the miner that successfully calculates a SHA-3 hash that matches the requirements specified in the proof-of-work challenge.

While blockchain technology is the clear way forward for industry early adopters, within traditional finance there remain concerns about corporate and enterprise application. Serving these needs, and thus bringing the blockchain solution to the mainstream, will depend on how blockchains are architected to protect client data from network interference or manipulation. As a significant component of the architecture, the right hash function can determine enterprise-level operability.

Securing the Capital Markets With SHA-3
As a hash standard providing certified security over users’ private keys as well as high speed, hardware-based encryption, SHA-3 best suits the needs of tomorrow’s capital markets. SHA-3 has the right characteristics to instill confidence in a peer-to-peer network that does not rely on centralized intermediaries for authority or governance.

Unlike the hash function of Bitcoin and other blockchains based on SHA 256, SHA-3 was developed by community collaboration via the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), forcing different perspectives and issues to be addressed. This meant that the hash function had to endure public scrutiny and exhaustive testing in order to be considered the hashing standard, which it hs now become. In 2015, NIST released SHA-3 as its standard for “securing the integrity of electronic information.”

A subset of Keccak, SHA-3 cryptography is built on sponge construction, a particular method of “absorbing” data in and then “squeezing” it out. Unlike other cryptographic hash functions, sponge construction allows for the input and output of any amount of data, extending the output function and making for greater flexibility of use.

One outdated concern weighed against SHA-3 is a slower hashing speed than its predecessors. This is fair, but only with regards to software. When it comes to hardware, SHA-3 easily outpaces SHA-1 and SHA-2, and hashing is increasingly occurring within hardware components. The third in a series, SHA-3 is remarkably different from its first and second iterations which share some of the same math and cryptographic structure (MD5).

Building a Better Blockchain
We have the opportunity to take what we’ve learned from today’s most prominent blockchains and create an iteration of the technology that leverages what works and meets our business needs for capital markets.

Building a new, dedicated cryptosecurity blockchain allows for customization and transparency that can better serve the needs of the future. Following the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS), SHA-3 is best suited to industry use with a hashrate “an order of magnitude higher than SHA-2,” as pointed out by the Keccak team.

After our own recent survey of hash algorithm candidates, including Equihash, Cuckoo Cycle and Ethash, we concluded that SHA-3 genuinely best serves the needs of capital markets. The survey looked at method of operation, work independency, ASIC optimization or resistance, difficulty control, algorithms, security and speed. Of the candidates, SHA-3 proved to be best-in-class, providing certified security and establishing trust in a network supporting global securities issuance, trading, and clearing and settlement.

BUIDL > HODL
Still nascent in its expansion, the blockchain industry as a whole is showing signs of maturity.

Continued volatility in the valuation of cryptocurrencies has proven to be too much for people looking for quick crypto profits. Token price does not faze those who “hodl” with a vision to build better tools and networks for a better future. And while volatility has helped to reduce some of the hysteria around cryptocurrency, there is a growing community looking for greater sophistication from industry participants. “Buidl,” a direct homage to “hodl,” is a movement focusing on development over cryptocurrencies. “Buidl” encourages teams to examine how blockchain technology can best support needed societal change versus quick, frivolous application. Thoughtful infrastructure is the way forward.

When it comes to capital markets, it should not be a race to move assets onto the blockchain, but a strategic process that makes it easy for new market participants to access growth capital and for existing participants to leverage the full benefits of distributed ledger technology. Employing the best-in-class cryptographic hash function serves this mission and empowers trust in a trustless system.

2018/6/15,"The Genesis Files: If Bitcoin Had a First Draft, Wei Dai’s B-Money Was It","All Cypherpunks value privacy; it’s basically the founding principle of the collective of cryptographers, academics, developers and activists grouped around the 1990s mailing list by the same name. But few put it in practice like Wei Dai does. Once described as an “intensely private computer engineer” by the New York Times, not many personal details are known about the man who, two decades ago, dreamed up an electronic cash system intriguingly similar to Bitcoin.

This lack of personal details is made up for by Wei Dai’s work and proliferation of ideas. A talented cryptographer, Dai created and still maintains Crypto++: a C++ library for cryptographic algorithms. Dai is also, to this day, active on rationality forums like LessWrong, where he philosophizes on such topics as artificial intelligence, ethics, epistemology and more. His insights earned him the praise of well-known AI researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky and repeated invitations to speak at his Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI; previously known as the Singularity Institute).

Dai’s interest in philosophy and politics is nothing new. Back in the 1990s, as a young bachelor student in computer science at Washington University, his curiosity led him to the writings of Timothy May, one of the “founding fathers” of the Cypherpunk movement. Dai was inspired by the crypto-anarchy May advocated; the brand-new ideology prevalent amongst Cypherpunks based on the conviction that cryptography and software could provide and safeguard political and economic freedom better than any system of government would.

“I am fascinated by Tim May's crypto-anarchy,” Dai wrote in 1998. “Unlike the communities traditionally associated with the word ‘anarchy’, in a crypto-anarchy the government is not temporarily destroyed but permanently forbidden and permanently unnecessary. It's a community where the threat of violence is impotent because violence is impossible, and violence is impossible because its participants cannot be linked to their true names or physical locations.”

By the mid-1990s, Dai engaged in discussions on various topics on the Cypherpunks mailing list such as digital reputation systems, game theory, privacy and anonymity in digital cash systems. Perhaps more importantly, Dai made a number of proposals to further the Cypherpunk cause, including trusted timestamping, an encrypted TCP tunneler, a secure file sharing system and more. It garnered him a reputation as a prolific contributor to the Cypherpunk community — though, even back then, no one knew much about him personally. (Not even whether Dai was male or female, Timothy May recently said.)

But Dai would become best known for an idea he casually announced in November 1998, just after graduating from university. “Efficient cooperation requires a medium of exchange (money) and a way to enforce contracts,” Dai explained. “The protocol proposed in this article allows untraceable pseudonymous entities to cooperate with each other more efficiently, by providing them with a medium of exchange and a method of enforcing contracts. [...] I hope this is a step toward making crypto-anarchy a practical as well as theoretical possibility.”

He called his proposal “b-money”.

B-money
Typical digital money systems use a central ledger to keep track of account balances. Whether it’s a central bank, a commercial bank, VISA or any other payment provider, a centrally-controlled database somewhere tracks who owns what.

The problem with this solution, from Dai’s and the crypto-anarchist perspective, is that it ultimately lets governments control the flow of money through regulation, while participants in the system are usually required to identify themselves. “My motivation for b-money was to enable online economies that are purely voluntary … ones that couldn’t be taxed or regulated through the threat of force,” he later explained.

So, Dai came up with an alternative solution. Or really, two alternative solutions.

In the first solution, instead of a central entity controlling the ledger, all participants maintain separate copies of the same ledger. Any time a new transaction is made, everyone updates their records. These ledgers, furthermore, would consist of public keys, with amounts attached to them — no real names. This decentralized approach would prevent any single entity from blocking transactions, while offering a level of privacy to all users.

As a quick example, let’s say Alice and Bob are b-money users. They both have a public key: Alice has public key “A” and Bob has public key “B”, for which they both control their unique private keys. And, as recorded in the ledgers maintained by all users, both their public keys hold b-money units; let’s say three units each.

If Bob wants to receive two b-money units from Alice (because he’s selling her a product), he sends her his public key: B. Assuming Alice wants to buy the product, she then creates a transaction in the form of a message: “2 b-money from A to B.” Next, she signs this message, with her private key corresponding to A. The message and the cryptographic signature is then sent to all b-money users.

The signed message proves to all b-money users that the rightful owner of A wants to send two b-money units to B. Everyone, therefore, updates their ledgers, now attributing a total of one b-money unit to A and a total of five b-money units to B — without learning that Alice or Bob control either.

If this solution sounds familiar, it should: It’s roughly how, 10 years later, Satoshi Nakamoto designed Bitcoin.

B-money, Version 2
Dai considered his first b-money solution impractical, however, “because it makes heavy use of a synchronous and unjammable anonymous broadcast channel,” he explained in his proposal.

Put differently, the first b-money proposal didn’t solve the double-spending problem. Alice could send two b-money units to both Bob’s B and to Carol’s C at the same time, transmitting these transactions to different parts of the network. Both Bob and Carol would give Alice a product in return … only to later find out that half of the network won’t acknowledge their new balances.

That’s why Dai came up with a second b-money solution, all in the same proposal.

In this version, not everyone maintains a version of the ledger. Instead, the system would consist of two types of users: regular users and “servers.” Only the servers, linked through a Usenet-style broadcast network, would maintain the b-money ledgers. To verify that a transaction went through like it should, regular users — like Bob and Carol — would have to verify it with a random subset of these servers. (In case of a conflict, Bob and Carol would presumably reject the transaction from Alice and not sell her anything.)

While not detailed in the proposal, anyone would probably have been able to become a server, but “each server is required to deposit a certain amount of money in a special account to be used as potential fines or rewards for proof of misconduct,” Dai proposed. The servers should also periodically publish and cryptographically commit to ownership databases.

“Each participant should verify that his own account balances are correct and that the sum of the account balances is not greater than the total amount of money created,” Dai envisioned. “This prevents the servers, even in total collusion, from permanently and costlessly expanding the money supply.”

If this sounds somewhat familiar as well, that’s no wonder either: Dai’s second b-money proposal loosely resembles what would today be called a proof-of-stake system.

To boot, Dai added an early version of a smart contract solution to his proposal(s). These types of smart contracts most closely resemble a mixture of a proof-of-stake system and an arbitration system, where both parties to a contract and an arbitrator must all deposit funds in a special account. Curiously for modern standards, however, these contracts did not have a dispute resolution system encoded: Instead it was possible that, in case of disputes, different users (or servers) would adjust their own ledgers differently, in effect leaving the state of ledgers on the network out of consensus. (Presumably, the potential penalties would make the cost of cheating too high to risk it.)

Monetary Policy
Yet, where b-money would have perhaps differed most sharply from Bitcoin was Dai’s proposed monetary policy.

Bitcoin’s monetary policy is of course very straightforward. To bring coins in circulation, it initially issued 50 new bitcoins per block, a number which has since dropped to 12.5. This number will continue to decrease over time until, some hundred years from now, the total amount of bitcoin issued caps out at slightly below 21 million. Whether or not such a monetary policy is ideal has been a subject of debate, but one thing is clear: So far it has not produced a stable coin value.

In contrast, a stable coin value was explicitly part of Dai’s vision. To achieve this, the value of b-money was to be coupled to the value of a (theoretical) basket of goods. For example, 100 b-money units would be worth one basket of goods. This should give b-money a stable value, at least in relation to this basket of goods: the same 100 b-money units would buy the same basket of goods in the past, in the present and in the future.

To issue new coins, users were to determine what a basket of goods would cost relative to a solution to a computational problem: a “proof of work.” If, for example, a basket of goods should cost $80 at specific point in time, it would have to be matched by a proof of work that would on average cost $80 to produce. If, 10 years later, the same basket of goods were to cost $120, the same 100 units would have to be matched with a proof of work that’d cost $120 to produce.

Using this indicator, the first person to produce a valid proof of work would be credited 100 new b-money by all users or the servers. Therefore, no one would be particularly incentivized to produce proofs of work unless they intended to use b-money, limiting inflation to the growth of the “b-money economy.”

Alternatively, in an appendix to his proposal, Dai suggested that money creation could be realized through an auction. Either all users (first protocol) or the servers (second protocol) would first have to determine an optimal increase of the monetary base. Then, if this ideal increase were to be established at 500 b-money units, for example, an auction would determine who should create these 500 units: whoever was willing and able to provide the most proof of work for it.

Bitcoin
B-money was never implemented. It couldn’t have been: “b-money wasn't a complete practical design yet,” Dai acknowledged in a LessWrong forum thread a couple of years ago. What’s more, Dai did not expect b-money to take off in a big way, even if it was implemented.

“I think b-money will at most be a niche currency/contract enforcement mechanism, serving those who don't want to or can't use government sponsored ones,” he explained in an email following his announcement on the Cypherpunks mailing list.

Indeed, several of b-money’s problems remained unsolved or at least under-specified. Perhaps, most importantly, its consensus model was not very robust, as best shown by Dai’s proposed smart contract solution. It has since also been found that proof-of-stake systems introduce new challenges that Dai may not have foreseen; for example, it’s not clear how “misconduct” can be objectively established. And that doesn’t even get into the more nuanced problems of the proposal, such as a lack of privacy due to traceability of funds or potential coin issuance (“mining”) centralization. Indeed, some of these problems are still not solved for Bitcoin today.

Dai — who after proposing b-money went on to work for TerraSciences and Microsoft, and may have retired early on since then — would not stick around to solve these problems.

“I didn't continue to work on the design because I had actually grown somewhat disillusioned with crypto-anarchy by the time I finished writing up b-money,” Dai later explained on LessWrong. He reiterated, “I didn't foresee that a system like it, once implemented, could attract so much attention and use beyond a small group of hardcore Cypherpunks.”

Yet, Dai’s proposal was not forgotten: b-money ended up as the first reference in the Bitcoin white paper. Still, as similar as b-money and Bitcoin’s designs may be, it’s possible that Satoshi Nakamoto was not inspired by Dai’s idea at all. Dai himself believes that Bitcoin’s inventor came up with the idea independently.

Shortly before publishing the Bitcoin white paper, Hashcash inventor Dr. Adam Back directed Satoshi Nakamoto to Dai’s work, making Dai one of few people Bitcoin’s inventor personally reached out to before publishing his white paper. But Dai did not respond to Satoshi’s email. In retrospect, he wished he had. Unsurprisingly, Dai questions Bitcoin’s coin generation model.

“I would consider Bitcoin to have failed with regard to its monetary policy (because the policy causes high price volatility which imposes a heavy cost on its users, who have to either take undesirable risks or engage in costly hedging in order to use the currency),” he wrote on LessWrong. “[O]ne possible impact of Bitcoin might be that due to its deficient monetary policy and associated price volatility it can't grow to very large scales, and by taking over the cryptocurrency niche, it has precluded a future where a cryptocurrency does grow to very large scales.”

He added, “This may have been partially my fault because when Satoshi wrote to me asking for comments on his draft paper, I never got back to him. Otherwise perhaps I could have dissuaded him (or them) from the ‘fixed supply of money’ idea.”

Author's note: After finishing this article, it was pointed out that the first version of Nick Szabo's Bit Gold goes back to early 1998. Even more similar to Satoshi Nakamoto's invention than b-money, it's probably more accurate to consider Bit Gold ""Bitcoin's first draft"".

2018/7/13,PoWx Seeks to Change Bitcoin Mining with “Optical PoW”,"Nonprofit organization PoWx has launched this week with the goal of boosting the idea behind proof of work (PoW) through more innovative algorithms. The company is seeking to decentralize Bitcoin mining and make it more accessible to consumers through a new technology that executives have dubbed “optical PoW” — a new type of hardware that utilizes a more advanced and energy-efficient form of laser technology as the cornerstone of mining.

Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining is usually off limits to those who cannot afford the expensive mining computers and equipment. In addition, miners are usually stuck dealing with high energy bills and excessive consumption of electricity. It is estimated that approximately 0.15 percent of the world’s energy is used to mine cryptocurrency.

This is where optical PoW comes into play. PoWx founder Michael Dubrovsky says the technology can alter Bitcoin’s current algorithm to make mining more decentralized and that the software’s advancements could make the mining arena “healthy enough and scalable enough.”  

The idea for optical PoW arose last year. Dubrovsky says concern was growing that the mining space would eventually become more centralized. Dubrovsky and the PoWx team specifically point their fingers at Bitmain, the Chinese mining giant largely responsible for building and supplying most of the necessary equipment to power Bitcoin mining.

Speaking with Bitcoin Magazine, Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Knots developer Luke Dashjr said he’s all for optical PoW and believes the mining scene as it stands could damage the future of cryptocurrency.

“Bitmain has compromised Bitcoin’s security, so changing to a new proof-of-work algorithm is necessary to secure the network again,” he commented. “One problem that enables mining centralization is that electricity costs are lower for large corporations than they are for ordinary users. Optical PoW claims it can eliminate this problem, and since it is an entirely new kind of technology, it also eliminates almost all of Bitmain’s advantages in trying to monopolize a new algorithm.”

If the new algorithm passes, mining chips could become less expensive, thereby potentially increasing the level of decentralization. In addition, optical PoW would make mining more efficient, which would allow miners to extract more coins in less time, giving them the opportunity to compensate for respective energy usage.

Unfortunately, PoWx still has several obstacles to overcome, the biggest one being a lack of funding. At press time, the company is garnering very little monetary assistance.

Furthermore, switching Bitcoin’s current proof-of-work algorithm won’t be easy. Every user will be required to update their own software, and in the end, it will be up to the public to either accept or reject the idea. Granted several users dismiss it or decide it’s not in their best interest, Bitcoin may “split” again as it did several times before, which has resulted in the creation of Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold and other so-called “forkcoins.”

Dashjr believes this could cause several hurdles. “Any PoW change requires consensus from the entire community, and thus far, it doesn’t seem probable that we will achieve that, in large part due to FUD [Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt] spread by miners who make it sound more dramatic than the simple change it really is,” he claims. “The community will need to overcome these unwarranted fears before Bitcoin can successfully migrate to a new algorithm.”

However, the company’s long-term goals remain ambitious. Dubrovsky estimates the release date of optical PoW to be early 2019. PoWx is also seeking to build a second company — Arrakis Photonics — that will put the hardware into practice.",Technical,0.9698
2018/8/3,Breeze Wallet with Breeze Privacy Protocol Mainnet Now Available for Download,"The Breeze Wallet with the Breeze Privacy Protocol public mainnet has been released and is now open to the public. The wallet showcases Stratis technology — a platform built for visual basic apps and blockchain solutions — and places heavy emphasis on both privacy and security for businesses seeking to implement business-to-business (B2B) transactions on the Stratis and Bitcoin blockchain networks.

The Breeze Wallet was first scheduled for release in mid-2017. Designed as a bitcoin wallet for desktops, the application would come with TumbleBit — a promising privacy advancement built on top of Bitcoin — and give customers the opportunity to mix their coins without the need to trust one another or the receiving wallets.

Speaking with Bitcoin Magazine last year, Stratis Founder and CEO Chris Trew explained, “We are integrating TumbleBit because it’s a trustless and secure solution that works with Bitcoin without any forks.”

Based in the U.K., Stratis is a startup that offers end-to-end solutions for development, testing and deployment of blockchain applications. Aside from maintaining its own blockchain, Stratis also boasts a native token, the Stratis token, and builds tools for existing blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin.

Developers claim the wallet boasts a user-friendly interface, along with what they dub the Masternode Client Discovery protocol, in which the Bitcoin or Stratis blockchain is used to discover, validate and connect to a Stratis Masternode. The process is decentralized and occurs through a trustless environment that is less vulnerable to network disruption.

Users employing the wallet can “obfuscate” transactions, meaning they can render them obscure or unintelligible. This primarily works for ventures or individuals seeking to conduct on-chain business while preventing that business from being viewed by the public. If a company receives regular payments from customers or makes payments to a supplier, this would be deemed commercially sensitive information and would thus be shielded.

Companies can also utilize the wallet to connect to a Stratis Masternode, thereby giving their transactions added protection across both the Bitcoin and Stratis networks. This is primarily done through TumbleBit, which provides anonymity by allowing several people to utilize the same payment channels. The channels are then protected with cryptographic puzzles that prevent any non-users from gaining access to the information they present.

The Breeze Wallet is compatible with Windows 64-bit and 32-bit, along with Mac OS X and Ubuntu. Respective wallet download links are available here.

At press time, Stratis had not responded to Bitcoin Magazine’s request for comment.",Technical,0.9744
2018/8/10,Lightning Network Payment System “SparkSwap” Makes Its Official Debut,"A new way to trade bitcoin and digital currencies is now in the books. SparkSwap is the first crypto exchange to be built on the Lightning Network. It allows users to trade both bitcoin and altcoins in seconds without depositing assets with a third party.

In a blog post, SparkSwap founder Trey Griffith said, “You can trade between different blockchains (currently Bitcoin and Litecoin, with others coming soon), with trades settling in about a second — a transaction time comparable to some of the leading centralized cryptocurrency exchanges.

“In an industry that, at times, seems to value hype and white papers over delivered, working software, we’ve opted for the latter. Our software is in a pre-alpha state, but we’ve successfully used it to execute BTC/LTC trades on the Bitcoin and Litecoin testnets.”

SparkSwap is made up of two primary components. The first is called the Broker and is the software run by users. It interprets user actions and converts them into network actions. It also executes payment channel network swaps and manages user wallets and private keys.

The second component is known as the Relayer, which is software run by staff members. It connects brokers who wish to execute monetary swaps; provides orderbook updates; and mitigates fraud and market manipulation. The Relayer also assists users with agreeing on swap prices and executes trades over payment channel networks like the Lightning Network, which eliminates the need for third parties.

Griffith explains, “With SparkSwap, you no longer need to choose between fast settlement, liquid trading pairs, and maintaining control of your assets. Your assets are no longer exposed to theft or loss by exchanges, either from bad actors or local governments.”

Crypto enthusiasts once believed that the Lightning Network was limited strictly to bitcoin, though this isn’t necessarily the case. For the longest time, bitcoin and altcoin exchanges occurred through processes known as atomic swaps where, if one individual wanted to trade altcoins for bitcoin while another sought to trade bitcoin for altcoins, they could trade by submitting two transactions: one to the bitcoin blockchain and the other to the respective altcoin blockchain.

The bitcoin from the second individual is sent to the first, who can then claim it, granted he reveals a secret number as part of the on-chain claim-transaction. This secret number, in turn, lets the second individual claim the altcoin on its respective blockchain. This prevents fraud from either end, while ensuring each party receives their respective funds.

Even though the process worked, it was also a hassle. The Lightning Network improves on atomic swaps by connecting not two blockchains but two payment channels, which can allow multiple parties to trade back and forth without trusting one another.

The Lightning Network can also be used to send transactions across different blockchain platforms, thereby permitting currencies to change owners off-chain. The result is a trustless environment in which currencies can move about without recording the transactions on specific blockchains.

Speaking with Bitcoin Magazine last year, Litecoin creator Charlie Lee stated, “Previous atomic swaps that I have done were on-chain and had the on-chain limitations of slow [transactions] and high transaction fees. Off-chain atomic swaps are significantly better. They are instant, [have] low fees and better protect one’s privacy.”

Griffith claims that SparkSwap works by utilizing the same trustless processes over the Lightning Network. He also says that while there is still more work to be done, the system is ready for public use, as staff members are eager to witness the community’s reaction and improve upon the technology from there.

“We’d like to be helpful if we can,” he states.",Technical,0.9843
2018/8/30,Pay From Bitcoin Mainnet to Lightning and Back: Submarine Swaps Are Now Live,"In order to make payments on the lightning network — Bitcoin’s second layer solution for instant and cheap transactions — users must first fund lightning channels. This process, however, creates a slight disconnect between lightning users and on-chain users. Lightning users can pay lightning users, and on-chain users can pay on-chain users, but they can’t pay one another directly.

To solve this, “Submarine Swaps” allow users to make trustless transactions between lightning addresses and on-chain addresses in either direction. The technology could be a game changer for both Bitcoin lightning and mainnet users, as it would remove the transaction barriers between them.

“[I] think this makes it a lot more attractive to [run] a lightning-only service,” Submarine Swap’s developer Alex Bosworth told Bitcoin Magazine, as on-chain users wouldn’t beexcluded. “You don't have to [...] worry about including the on-chain people,” he said. “You can outsource that to somebody else, and you don’t have to trust them.”

What Are Submarine Swaps?
Using the same cryptographic tricks as those used in the lightning network, Submarine Swaps use a trustless middleman to link a Lightning channel transaction with an on-chain one. This middleman, likely a program called a swap provider, is tasked with settling both the on-chain and off-chain transactions with both users, bridging the gap between Bitcoin’s network and the lightning network.

If one lightning network user wants to send funds to an on-chain user, for example, the middleman will transfer these funds to its own lightning wallet, if (and only if) he sends a transaction with comparable funds on the Bitcoin blockchain to the desired on-chain address. The process works the same in the inverse if an on-chain address wants to send funds to a lightning address.

“There's lots of different ways it can be used,” Bosworth said. “So let's say an exchange wants to send to a lightning invoice but it doesn’t have lightning funds, or it doesn't have a lightning wallet; in that case, it could ask somebody who does have that to assist them, and then they could do so in a way where its locked to their on-chain unit.”

He continued to explain that the feature could ultimately be integrated into wallets, enabling an on-chain client “that doesn’t even know about lightning” to transact with its users.

Bosworth also pointed out that the swap providers could be the one and the same person. “It’s flexible in that respect. So you can have it be either a [third party] or it could even be yourself.”

When asked if the swapping mechanism would want for liquidity, Bosworth said that he believes transaction rewards will incentivize enough users to front their bitcoin for transactions. “[Users] are incentivized by the swap rate to provide liquidity, I think that will attract more liquidity. This is a low risk operation, so I can either have my coins just sit there doing nothing or I can have them available for swaps and generate some revenue,” he stated.

The Submarine Swaps concept was originally conceptualized by Lightning Labs CTO Olaoluwa Osuntokun — though Bosworth came up with the same idea independently. The technology can be applied in various use cases, as Bosworth envisions.

The technology is still in its infancy, as Bosworth explained, and it’s also contingent on the development of existing lightning network applications.

“I’ve started doing tests on mainnet, and you can try testing it out on Submarine Swaps so you can see a swap in action, but there’s lots of stuff to work out and the LND still needs work; they’re working on a major new release, so things are moving along but I wouldn’t say it's like super safe because not everything is 100 percent yet.”",Technical,-0.1027
2018/9/3,Bitcoin as a Privacycoin: This Tech is Making Bitcoin More Private,"Ever since its inception Bitcoin has never really been private. Although Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper suggests privacy was a design goal of the protocol, government agencies, analytics companies and other interested parties — let’s call them “spies” — have ways to analyze the public blockchain and peer-to-peer network, to cluster Bitcoin addresses and tie them to IP addresses or other identifying information.

A lack of privacy is a problem. Bitcoin users might not necessarily want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own, while businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors — to name a few examples. Additionally, a lack of privacy could lead to a loss of fungibility: the property by which each monetary unit is worth the same as any other, which is an essential requirement for money. If, for example, it can be established that certain coins were at some point used for politically sensitive purposes, some might be less willing to accept these “tainted” coins as payment, harming fungibility for all of Bitcoin.

Fortunately, spying on Bitcoin users is becoming increasingly difficult. Recent months in particular saw the introduction of a number of promising, privacy-enhancing technologies, and several more solutions should be released throughout the rest of the year or the next.

Here’s an overview of some of the most promising projects.

TumbleBit
Almost two years in the making, TumbleBit was long among the most highly anticipated privacy solutions to be rolled out on Bitcoin.

TumbleBit is a coin-mixing protocol that uses a (centralized) tumbler to create off-chain payment channels between participants in a mixing session. Through these channels, all participants send coins and receive an equal amount of different coins in return. This process breaks the trail of ownership for all: neither spies nor any of the participants can re-establish who paid who. Further, and importantly, TumbleBit utilizes clever cryptographic tricks to ensure that even the tumbler can’t establish a link between the users.

TumbleBit does require two on-chain transactions per participant (one to open a channel, one to close it). While a trustless solution, this does make it one with somewhat higher fees than the alternatives.

TumbleBit was first proposed in 2016 by an academic research team from Boston University, George Mason University and North Carolina State University, headed by Ethan Heilman and presented at Scaling Bitcoin Milan in the fall of that year. The ball really got rolling when NBitcoin developer Nicolas Dorier implemented an early version of the technology, which was later improved by privacy-focused developer Ádám Ficsór and others, to ultimately be implemented in Stratis’ Breeze wallet.

This Breeze wallet was officially released about a month ago, meaning that TumbleBit is currently available for anyone to use — though usage (and, therefore, the privacy-providing anonymity set) is reportedly still low.

Chaumian CoinJoin and ZeroLink
CoinJoin is an old idea by Bitcoin standards, first proposed by Bitcoin Core contributor Gregory Maxwell in 2013. In essence, the trick is to combine several transactions into one bigger transaction, obfuscating which bitcoins are moving from which sending addresses (“inputs”) to which receiving addresses (“outputs”), exactly.

As a simple example, let’s say Alice, Bob and Carol all want to mix their coins with each other. Using CoinJoin, they can create a transaction that sends money back to themselves, using new addresses not tied to their identity. As long as Alice, Bob and Carol use equal amounts of coins, spies can’t tell which of the new addresses belongs to whom. (If they use different amounts of coins it’s obvious which coins moved where.)

CoinJoin transactions have been a reality for years, but for a long time one problem remained: Someone — like Alice, Bob or Carol — needs to construct the transaction. This person must learn exactly which old addresses are sending bitcoin to which new addresses; otherwise, it would be impossible to construct the transaction. If this person is a spy — which is often impossible to know — the effort becomes pointless: The spy could re-establish the trail of coin ownership.

This problem can also be solved, using a trick mentioned by Gregory Maxwell in the same 2013 proposal, dubbed “Chaumian CoinJoin” (after David Chaum’s blind signature scheme).

In short, Alice, Bob and Carol will now connect to a central Chaumian CoinJoin server, perhaps operated by a wallet provider. First, they all give their sending addresses, as well as blinded (cryptographically scrambled) receiving addresses, which are cryptographically signed by the server. Then, Alice, Bob and Carol disconnect in order to reconnect via a hidden connection (like Tor) and provide their unblinded addresses. Utilizing the magic of Chaumian blind signatures, the server can verify that the unblinded addresses match with the blinded addresses. This allows it to verify that the addresses really belong to Alice, Bob and Carol — not to an attacker — without learning which of the addresses belong to whom.

The Chaumian CoinJoin proposal fell by the wayside for about four years after it was first proposed. Then, about a year ago, Ádám Ficsór — while working on Breeze’s TumbleBit implementation — rediscovered the proposal and decided to implement it.

Embedded in the ZeroLink framework Ficsór has since designed, Chaumian CoinJoin is now implemented in Ficsór’s new privacy-focused Wasabi Wallet, which was recently released in beta. Even more recently, privacy-focused Samourai Wallet announced it will soon release a mobile ZeroLink implementation, called Whirlpool. Yet another, newer wallet by the name of Bob Wallet is also developing a ZeroLink implementation.

ETA: Available now (beta)

Schnorr Signatures for CoinJoin and More
While CoinJoin — including Chaumian CoinJoin — was always possible, and first proposed years ago, it’s never caught on in a big way so far. For a long time, no popular wallet offered the feature, which may be because CoinJoin transactions add complexity, with little upside for those who don’t care about privacy as much.

Schnorr signatures, for which Bitcoin Core and Blockstream developer Pieter Wuille recently presented an official Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP), could help provide this upside.

Named after its inventor Claus-Peter Schnorr, Schnorr signatures are considered by many cryptographers to be the best type of cryptographic signatures in the field. Perhaps the biggest concrete advantage for Bitcoin is that multiple signatures can be aggregated into a single signature. This means that one signature can prove ownership of multiple sending addresses (inputs). Therefore, only one signature is ever needed per regular transaction, no matter how many sending addresses (inputs) are included.

CoinJoin transactions, of course, always include multiple sending addresses as well, at least one for each participant and possibly more. Schnorr signatures could, therefore, add a new benefit to using CoinJoin: They enable all participants, not only to combine their transactions into one, but also to combine their signatures in that transaction into one. This would make the CoinJoin transaction smaller in size than the individual transactions combined would have been which, in turn, means that miners should charge a smaller processing fee.

With Schnorr, there would be a cost benefit to using the most private option, which might just provide the right incentive for wallets to implement it and make it the go-to option for everyone.

In addition, Schnorr signatures’ mathematical properties will benefit a brand new class of more complex, smart contract-like solutions with names like “scriptless scripts,” “Taproot” and “Graftroot.” Interestingly, these solutions would appear like regular Bitcoin transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. This could for example enable futures markets, decentralized exchanges or insurance contracts without spies being able to identify anything but regular-seeming transactions.

ETA: Optimistically, 2019

STONEWALL
Another CoinJoin-related privacy measure was introduced by Samourai Wallet in May 2018 as a replacement for a similar but inferior solution. Called STONEWALL, the trick doesn’t actually utilize CoinJoin — but makes it seem that it does.

STONEWALL transactions are, in effect, regular transactions: They send bitcoin from one user to another. However, STONEWALL transactions do something odd: They include an unnecessary number of sending addresses (inputs) and change addresses (outputs). This makes the transaction look a lot like a CoinJoin transaction — a transaction where two people are combining their transactions into one — even though, in reality, it isn’t. (More details here.)

The idea behind STONEWALL is to break (indeed, stonewall) the assumptions that spies presumably make when analyzing the Bitcoin blockchain. If these spies can’t tell for sure whether transactions are really CoinJoin transactions or not, any conclusions based on this transaction data is worthless.

Samourai Wallet will soon also deploy 2-wallet STONEWALL, which are real CoinJoin transactions, shared between two users that trust one another with their privacy.

ETA: Available now; 2-wallet STONEWALL to follow in the next month or two

Dandelion
A very different method to deanonymize Bitcoin users is through analysis of the peer-to-peer network. More specifically, spying nodes could monitor the Bitcoin network to try and find out where transactions originate: The first node to transmit a transaction is probably the one that created it.

Dandelion is a solution proposed by a team of academic researchers from Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Illinois and MIT. It was recently presented at the Building on Bitcoin conference in Lisbon by Carnegie Mellon University professor Giulia Fanti.

The solution counters network analysis by changing how transactions are spread over the peer-to-peer network. Instead of immediately broadcasting and forwarding a new transaction to as many peers as possible, the Dandelion protocol initially sends a new transaction to only one peer node. This node randomly decides whether it also forwards it to only one peer — or not. If forwarded to only one peer, the next node will randomly decide what to do as well. (And so forth.) If not forwarded to only one peer, the node transitions to broadcasting the transaction to as many peers as possible, and all receiving peer nodes follow suit. This should make it significantly harder for spies to pinpoint where a transaction originated.

A version of Dandelion has already been implemented by the research team, and the general proposal has received a positive response within Bitcoin’s development community. As such, it seems likely to be included in an upcoming Bitcoin Core release (though the very next release, 0.17.0, will come too soon).

ETA: 2019

BIP 151 Encryption
Another older proposal to limit network analysis is BIP 151, authored by Bitcoin Core maintainer and Shift developer Jonas Schnelli. BIP 151 is a somewhat straightforward solution: It would let Bitcoin nodes encrypt traffic (hence, transaction and block data) between them.

It should be noted, however, that in bare form BIP 151 is no panacea for privacy. For one thing, the Bitcoin blockchain is public anyway, and, more importantly, nodes could connect to and share data with the very same spies they’d prefer to hide from. Still, BIP 151 could be a stepping stone to counter several types of attacks, including attacks on privacy (such as man-in-the-middle attacks).

And even in bare form, the solution is arguably better than nothing. Specifically, particular use cases and scenarios would benefit from peer-to-peer encryption; for example, ISPs or open wifi networks would no longer be able to monitor Bitcoin traffic.

While BIP 151 dropped off the radar a little bit for a year or two after it was first proposed, Schnelli recently picked up the project again and re-drafted an “official” BIP to be discussed and potentially included in Bitcoin Core.

ETA: 2019

Compact Client-Side Block Filtering
To use Bitcoin without needing to download and verify the entire blockchain, many people use light clients, like mobile wallets. Unfortunately, almost all of these light clients have weak, if any privacy protection. They typically share their addresses with either a central server or a random node on the network, both of which can be spies or be spied on.

Many of the light clients that (effectively) share their addresses with a random node on the network use a trick called Simplified Payment Verification (SPV). These SPV clients typically use “Bloom filters” to request the transactions potentially relevant for them — if there are any. While such a filter will return false positives, which means the SPV client will request more transactions than strictly needed, these are few compared to downloading all transactions.

Unfortunately, SPV wallets do effectively reveal all their addresses to the nodes they request this data from as well. To tackle this problem, Lightning Labs developers Olaoluwa Osuntokun and Alex Akselrod, along with Coinbase developer Jim Posen, proposed a new solution called “compact client-side block filtering.”

Compact client-side block filtering was originally designed for Lightning Labs’ Lightning-focused Neutrino wallet but can be used by regular Bitcoin wallets as well: the Wasabi Wallet already implemented the solution in its beta release.

Compact, client-side block filtering essentially inverts the trick that current SPV wallets use. Instead of SPV wallets requesting transactions relevant to them by creating and sending out a Bloom filter, full nodes create a similar filter. SPV wallets then use this filter to establish that relevant transactions did not happen. If the filter does produce a match, Neutrino fetches the relevant block to see if the match really concerns the exact transaction, instead of a false positive.

Since SPV wallets using compact, client-side block filtering no longer request anything specific from any node, to instead receive a one-size-fits-all filter, they also reveal nothing about their transaction history.

Liquid and Confidential Transactions
Liquid is the first commercial sidechain developed by blockchain development company Blockstream. Its main purpose is to establish transaction channels between exchanges and other high-volume Bitcoin companies (like brokerages), allowing them to send bitcoin and other assets between them much faster than the Bitcoin blockchain would allow. In the future, regular users (most obviously traders) should be able to access the sidechain too, with special Liquid wallets.

One feature implemented on Liquid is Confidential Transactions (CT). CT is a trick that blinds (hides) the sending and receiving amount(s) in transactions. This is possible because clever cryptography allows math to be performed on the blinded amounts. All Liquid users can verify that the receiving amount(s) did not exceed the sending amount(s). In other words, they can check that no bitcoin was created out of thin air — even if they don’t know exactly how much money changed hands.

In the context of Liquid, this means (among others things) that exchanges can move funds between them without anyone being able to tell how much was moved. The process offers privacy, and competitors will, for example, be unable to tell how much money is held in the exchanges. Meanwhile, traders can no longer use such information to trade on, which is effectively a form of front running possible today due to the public nature of Bitcoin’s blockchain.

As Liquid becomes available to regular traders later on, these users could, most obviously, utilize the protocol to keep their balances hidden from spies, even after withdrawing funds from an exchange to temporarily hold it on the sidechain or move it to a different exchange. In addition, CoinJoin types of solutions could be developed for Liquid wallets, for a particularly powerful combination of privacy technologies. (As several transactions are merged into one and amounts are hidden, establishing links between the addresses becomes virtually impossible.)

Even further out, CT may also be implemented on the main Bitcoin protocol. There are some ideas for how to accomplish this through a backward-compatible soft fork already, but, while technological innovation is advancing, such upgrades would still come with significant detriment for scalability and are probably still far from becoming a reality.

ETA: Available for exchanges and other high-volume Bitcoin companies any day now; regular traders later and mainnet users maybe one day.

2018/9/21,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly Details of One of Bitcoin’s Nastiest Bugs Yet","For well over a year, versions of Bitcoin Core — Bitcoin’s leading software implementation — contained a severe software bug. The bug was fixed with Bitcoin Core 0.16.3 (and 0.17.0rc4), released this week, and the status of the Bitcoin network now appears to be safe, with no harm done. The Bitcoin Core project has since released a full disclosure report, revealing that the bug was even worse than previously thought.

These are the good, the bad and the ugly details about one of Bitcoin Core’s nastiest bugs to date. (But not in that order.)

The Bad
The bad, of course, is the bug itself, now documented as CVE-2018-17144 in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures databank.

The bug was introduced as part of a block relay-related performance improvement deployed in Bitcoin Core 0.14.0, officially released in March of 2017. In short, the bug would have nodes fail to reject a block containing a transaction that spends the same coins (“inputs”) multiple times. Indeed, it would allow for an (irregular) form of double-spending: arguably the very thing Bitcoin was designed to prevent.

It posed a serious problem, which could have manifested in several ways.

First, Bitcoin Core versions 0.14.0 through 0.14.2 (and, in some cases, newer versions), would have accepted the block but, at the same time, recognized that something was wrong. However, they wouldn’t be able to tell what was wrong, exactly. As a result, the node would stop operating altogether and shut down. If an invalid block caused by this bug had made its way to such nodes, they would have, in effect, crashed. That’s bad.

But it gets much worse.

Bitcoin Core versions 0.15.0 through 0.16.2 included another performance improvement, making it such that, in some cases, these nodes would no longer have realized something was wrong. Specifically, if the double-spent coin had not been moved in the same block already (which is often the case), these nodes would have accepted the transaction and block as normal. In a hypothetical, worst-case scenario, a malicious miner could have inflated Bitcoin’s money supply by copying his own coins, and anyone relying on Bitcoin Core versions 0.15.0 through 0.16.2 would have accepted these coins as valid.

Technically, the bug could also have caused a blockchain fork between affected nodes (Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 through 0.16.2 and codebase forks of it) and unaffected nodes (most notably Bitcoin Core 0.13.2 and older, as well as some alternative Bitcoin implementations). This is unlikely, however, since the latter category probably doesn’t have sufficient hash power behind it to generate even a single block within a couple of days — let alone several blocks. These nodes would have instead stalled, waiting for a valid block.

Still, the bug in question could have allowed for one of the worst attacks on Bitcoin in years. It’s sobering for many that this bug made it into a release of Bitcoin’s leading software implementation, as well as several codebase forks of it, and remained unnoticed for about 18 months.

The Good
Now, the good news.

The first and main piece of good news is that the bug has never been exploited in any way.

The second piece of good news is that it was not very likely the bug would ever have been exploited in the first place. This is because the attack could only have been exploited by a miner intentionally creating an “attack” block — not by a miner doing so by accident and also not by a regular user.

This means that a miner would have had to knowingly risk forfeiting a regular block reward worth some $80,000. An attack like this would have been noticed fairly quickly — everything happens on a public blockchain, while crash reports would probably have flooded chat rooms and forums. At that point, the Bitcoin user base would certainly agree that the added inflation was, in fact, caused by a bug — and should not be accepted as a new protocol rule.

Therefore, like with the bug that caused the value overflow incident in 2010 or the bug that split the Bitcoin network in 2013, a majority of miners (by hash power) would have either upgraded or downgraded their software quickly, rejecting the “attack block” to mine on the “honest chain” instead. As soon as this honest chain overtook the “attack chain,” even vulnerable nodes would have switched to the honest chain and disregarded the attack chain, leaving the attacking miner without any block reward.

Further, coins on the attack chain would presumably have dropped in value rather quickly: Markets are unlikely to value a coin that can be copied “out of thin air” by a malicious miner. As such, this miner would have immediately undermined the value of the same coins being copied, possibly defeating the point of the attack. (Granted, the miner could also make money by shorting the markets, but this still comes with significant risks.)

The third piece of good news is that the bug was responsibly disclosed by an unknown person on Monday to several developers working on Bitcoin Core (as well as Bitcoin Cash implementations Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin Unlimited). It was originally presented as a denial of service (DoS) bug which, as mentioned, is accurate for Bitcoin Core versions 0.14.0 through 0.14.2. But on further examination, Bitcoin Core contributor and Chaincode Labs employee Matt Corallo found that the same bug was also an inflation vulnerability.

The bug was quickly patched and released on Tuesday in a new Bitcoin Core minor release: Bitcoin Core 0.16.3. The bug is also patched in the fourth and latest release candidate for Bitcoin Core’s upcoming major release, 0.17.0. Meanwhile, the select group of Bitcoin Core contributors that were aware of the bug started reaching out to key players in the Bitcoin ecosystem, most notably miners and large businesses, asking them to upgrade to Bitcoin Core 0.16.3. Regular users were also urged to upgrade.

The fourth piece of good news is that a majority of miners on the network has probably upgraded to get rid of the bug by now. This means that even if an attacker were to try and exploit it, he wouldn’t get very far. The honest miners would overtake the attack chain sooner rather than later, at which point even non-upgraded nodes would accept the honest chain as the only valid chain. To err on the side of safety, users are currently recommended to wait for extra confirmations before accepting a payment, however.

(In technical terms, the effects on the Bitcoin protocol are as follows: Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 introduced an ""accidental hard fork"" that was never triggered or acted on by miners and, therefore, never led to a blockchain fork. This “hard fork” has practically been undone by an intentional, miner-enforced soft fork over the past couple of days, possibly also enforced by the Bitcoin economy at this point in time.)

The Ugly
The severity of a bug like this can be tricky to deal with on an open, decentralized, continuously operating network, supported by open-source software. As exemplified when Bitcoin Unlimited patched a bug in early 2017, the very act of fixing a vulnerability in the code might reveal it to potential adversaries, opening a window of attack until the fix is widely deployed on nodes in the field.

To avoid such attacks, those Bitcoin Core contributors aware of the problem decided not to make the severity of the bug public right away. Initially omitting some information from miners, companies and the greater public, they opted to disclose the DoS vulnerability — but not the inflation vulnerability. They hoped that the DoS vulnerability (and some strong recommendations) would be enough reason for users to upgrade, without tipping off a potential attacker. A full disclosure would follow later.

However, not everyone shared this approach. As the bug came under the spotlight, more people started to figure out on their own that the bug was more severe than just a DoS vulnerability. It’s rumoured that some started to leak the full extent of the vulnerability, arguably putting the Bitcoin network at greater risk of attack. When the vulnerability was reported on Hacker News (though later retracted), there was little reason to keep it under the covers much longer.

Fortunately, by then, it seemed to the Bitcoin Core contributors in the know that most miners had upgraded, meaning that the Bitcoin network was safe. While sooner than originally planned, the Bitcoin Core project opted to publish the full disclosure by Thursday evening.

A number of altcoins based on Bitcoin’s codebase are possibly still vulnerable to the attack, however, and the fact that the weakness is now publicly known probably does not help. While the leading implementations of the biggest Bitcoin codebase-based cryptocurrencies — most notably Bitcoin Cash’s Bitcoin ABC — deployed fixes and are also safe by now, smaller coins may still be at risk.",Technical,-0.9959
2018/10/3,Bitcoin Core 0.17.0 Is Released: Here’s What’s New,"Today marks the official release of Bitcoin Core 0.17.0, the 17th generation of Bitcoin’s original software client launched by Satoshi Nakamoto almost 10 years ago and still the dominant Bitcoin implementation on the network today. Overseen by Bitcoin Core lead maintainer Wladimir van der Laan, this latest major release was developed by some 135 contributors over a span of about seven months.

The result of well over 700 merged pull requests, Bitcoin Core 0.17.0 includes a range of performance improvements and bug fixes, as well as other changes.

Here’s an overview of some of these changes.

Improved Coin Selection
Coins in a wallet are effectively stored as separate chunks (“transaction outputs”). There is typically one chunk for each received payment; therefore, most chunks represent different amounts. When a payment is made from a wallet, different chunks are added together to make up an amount that’s large enough to make the payment, plus the fee. The different chunks often don’t add up to the exact amount needed, however, in which case a “change address” is added to the transaction, sending any leftover funds back to the same wallet.

Up until now, the Bitcoin Core wallet added different chunks together. Only then would it calculate and add the fee required to pay for the transaction. But in some cases, adding the fee to the transaction meant that the added chunks no longer made up a large enough amount, in which case an additional chunk had to be included.

Bitcoin Core 0.17.0 introduces the “Branch and Bound” algorithm designed by BitGo engineer Mark Erhardt. This offers two concrete improvements. First, the fee for each chunk is calculated before it is selected to be part of a transaction in order to avoid new chunks having to be added later. Second, the algorithm tries to match different chunks so they add up to the exact amount needed, avoiding the need for “change addresses” (where the leftover “change” gets sent) where possible. (Big wallets with lots of chunks, like those operated by exchanges or other high-traffic entities, are less likely to need change addresses than other wallets.)

Additionally, the coin selection algorithm in Bitcoin Core 0.17.0 includes an optional privacy improvement.

While it is against best practices, it’s possible to receive multiple payments to the same Bitcoin address. (This happens a lot with donation addresses, for example.) Reusing addresses is bad for privacy in itself as it’s obvious that all the coins on that address and all payments made from that address are from the same user. But it’s even worse when the different chunks tied to the same address are used in different transactions, linking them to chunks that weren’t initially associated with that address.

To fix this last problem, Bitcoin Core 0.17.0 gives users the option to prioritize adding chunks tied to the same address together in a transaction and to leave any other chunks out of the transaction where possible.

Easily Create and Use New Wallets
Since Bitcoin Core 0.15.0, it’s been possible to create several wallets that operate independently of each other. These wallets all have their own separate Bitcoin addresses, private keys and, therefore, funds. Users can utilize the different wallets for different purposes; for example, one wallet can be used for personal day-to-day purchases, another for business-related transactions, and a third just for trading. This can make accounting easier and more convenient, and users can more easily benefit from increased privacy as the different wallets cannot be linked to each other by blockchain analysis.

However, up until now, new wallets could only be created when starting up the node, and it was not available for Bitcoin Core wallet (GUI) users. Both of these limitations are now resolved. Bitcoin Core 0.17.0 lets users create new wallets whenever they’d like, and it offers this feature in the GUI.

As an added benefit, Bitcoin Core 0.17.0 introduces a feature called “Scantxoutset.” This lets users quickly verify whether their new wallet already includes coins (for example, because the private keys are imported from another wallet) by checking the unspent transaction output (UTXO) set, instead of rescanning the entire transaction history.

Non-HD to HD Wallet Upgrade
Whereas Bitcoin Core versions older than 0.13.0 still required users to back up all their private keys, all Bitcoin Core versions since have offered Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets instead. HD wallet users only need to store one seed phrase (a list of words) as a backup.

However, Bitcoin Core users who upgraded their system to Bitcoin Core 0.13.0 and newer were unable to create new HD wallets. An incompatibility between non-HD wallets and HD wallets meant that these users were still stuck backing up all their private keys.

Bitcoin Core 0.17.0 now lets these users upgrade to the HD format as well. In addition, Bitcoin Core wallet users who already had HD wallets can now opt to generate or import a new HD seed.

Watch Only–Only Wallets
Bitcoin wallets typically store private keys, which allow users to spend their coins. But Bitcoin Core has also supported “Watch Only” addresses for some time now. The private keys to these addresses are not stored in the wallet, but coins attached to these addresses are still visible in the wallet. This lets users easily accept payments and keep track of their funds while, for example, storing their private keys offline.

Bitcoin Core 0.17.0 takes this concept one step further and allows users to create specific Watch Only wallets in which every address is a Watch Only address. As a concrete example, this will make it easier to use Bitcoin Core to keep track of funds in a hardware wallet or on a paper wallet in the form of an HD seed.

Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions
While many transactions are straightforward — one user pays another — Bitcoin allows for more complex types of transactions as well. These include, for example, multisignature (multisig) transactions where several users need to sign off on sending funds, as well as privacy-enhancing CoinJoin transactions where different users merge their independent transactions into one big transaction.

To better facilitate these types of transactions, Bitcoin Core 0.17.0 introduces the BIP 174 Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (PSBT) framework, designed by Andrew Chow. This framework lets Bitcoin Core users sign a transaction partially, but also adds metadata to such a partially signed transaction. This metadata can be used by someone else to complete the transaction.

PSBT will be particularly useful if the standard is adopted by other wallets. As one potential use case, it could, for example, let a user protect his funds by locking them into a multisig account in which a transaction would require a signature created from the Bitcoin Core wallet, as well as a signature from a hardware wallet. Or it could let Bitcoin Core users partake in CoinJoin schemes with (other) privacy-preserving wallet users.

For now, the partially-signed-transaction feature is only for users who operate Bitcoin Core from the command line or through connected applications.

Pruning from the User Interface
Storing all (on-chain) Bitcoin transactions that ever happened, the Bitcoin blockchain is currently well over 180 gigabytes and growing every day. New Bitcoin Core users must download and validate all this data.

Thanks to a trick called “blockchain pruning,” however, these users do not necessarily need to store all this data. In pruning mode, nodes will automatically forget about older transaction data and keep only what’s necessary to operate securely. Until now, pruning mode could be enabled only through command line.

For the first time, Bitcoin Core 0.17.0 offers a convenient GUI toggle to enable pruning from the wallet, making it more accessible for casual, non-technical Bitcoin users who wish to run a full node for optimal security.

2018/10/10,Blockstream’s Liquid Network for “High Value” Bitcoin Payments Is Live,"The Liquid Network is up and running.

More than a year after its conceptual introduction at the Blockchain Association of Canada's Government Forum in Ottawa, Blockstream’s bitcoin scaling solution made its public debut on October 10, 2018, after going live among its partners on September 27.

Described by its creators as “an inter-exchange settlement network,” Liquid is Blockstream’s complement to Lightning. However, whereas Lightning is designed for micropayments, Blockstream’s CSO Samson Mow told Bitcoin Magazine, “Liquid is designed to facilitate fast and reliable high value transfers.”

“Liquid allows parties to send funds to any destination, without the need to establish channels ahead of time. Funds in Lightning are ‘hot’ (private keys are online), whereas you can store Liquid Bitcoin in both hot or cold wallets. Liquid also has the ability to have Lightning added as a second layer as well, so we view these two technologies as complementary and both important for the ecosystem.”

Unlike its counterpart in Lightning, which is a secondary layer, Liquid was built as a Bitcoin sidechain. Though not exclusive to Bitcoin, you can think of a sidechain as an extension of the Bitcoin blockchain. It allows users to swap coins from the main blockchain to its sidechain in a 1-to-1 parity, usually to tap into a feature that the main network doesn’t provide.

For Liquid, that feature is fast transactions with a special emphasis on trading mass sums between exchanges, financiers and market makers. As such, Mow says that exchanges and members of the Liquid network will be the main providers of liquidity, since they will be the ones keeping a balance of L-BTC which, in turn, they would allow their users to swap for.

This design is a bit of a spin on the original ideation of a sidechain. The concept was initially pitched as an avenue for trustless swaps, but Liquid’s iteration, which requires intermediaries to execute these swaps, may be called a federated sidechain.

“The members of Liquid secure the network by running functionary servers that run the Liquid blockchain as well as maintaining the two-way peg to the Bitcoin blockchain,” he said. He drew the comparison that “Liquid functionaries are like miners” who “generate new blocks to add to the Liquid blockchain.”

To leverage sidechain’s features, users have to exchange mainnet BTC for Liquid Network’s L-BTC using peg addresses.

“When someone wants to move BTC to the Liquid sidechain,” Mow explained, “they send it to a unique peg-in address. When someone is ready to move their money back to the Bitcoin blockchain, they can make a peg-out transaction that will tell the [Liquid members] to send Bitcoin to the desired address.”

After Launch: Looking Forward
Upon launch, the project has 23 partners lined up to serve as Liquid members, namely Altonomy, Atlantic Financial, Bitbank, Bitfinex, Bitmax, BitMEX, Bitso, BTCBOX, BTSE, Bull Exchange, DGroup, Coinone, Crypto Garage, GOPAX (operated by Streami), Korbit, L2B Global, OKCoin, The Rock Trading, SIX Digital Exchange, Unocoin, Xapo, XBTO and Zaif.

Moving forward, Liquid hopes to expand its membership and build out its services. These services could include Issued Assets (IA), Mow explained, what amount to “native tokens within the Liquid blockchain.” These IA could be security tokens, tokenized commodities/real-world assets or even Ethereum.

More than IA, Mow stated that Liquid has “a lot of things coming down the pipe” following its launch. These include a Liquid Testnet that is anchored to Blockstream Signet (Blockstream’s testnet for Bitcoin), GreenAddress integration, a Liquid mobile wallet for mobile platforms, a user interface for Issued Assets, a Liquid Block Explorer and hardware wallet support. He expects these features to be fully functioning by 2018, with more coming in 2019.

In the short term, Blockstream will focus on building out these features to ease Liquid’s introduction to and use in the wider cryptocurrency community. In the long term, Mow said the the company hopes to see Bitcoin at the epicenter of a nexus of sidechains that allow for a seamless, interconnected exchange of the industry’s many assets.

“The end game is a platform for the trustless exchange of many assets, with Bitcoin at the center,” said Mow. “We knew that having a high speed inter-exchange settlement network with privacy features would be something the market would respond well towards, but we’ve seen an incredible interest from parties interested to issue tokens and assets on Liquid as well. They’ve just been waiting for a secure and reliable solution to do so.”",Technical,0.9958
2018/11/5,BitMEX Launches New Fork Monitoring Website to Keep Track of Bitcoin Forks,"BitMEX just launched a website to make it easier to keep tabs on hard and soft forks on the Bitcoin blockchain.

According to a recent blog post, the research arm of BitMEX is sponsoring a new website, ForkMonitor.info, which is connected to 13 nodes of Bitcoin and its hard forks, most notably Bitcoin Cash.

The website will monitor many different aspects of the networks and their associated blockchains, with the ultimate goal of keeping track of these variables during forks to be “potentially useful in helping to detect unintentional consensus bugs.”

The article says that BitMEX is launching this new website in anticipation of an upcoming hard fork for Bitcoin Cash, which is expected to take place on November 15, 2018.

In fact the head of BitMEX Research, who asked to remain unnamed, told Bitcoin Magazine that, in the short term, the monitor was built to ""provide a useful and simple website to track what happens during the Bitcoin Cash hardfork on 15th Nov 2018."" For the long term, though, its overarching purpose will be to police the potential bugs and vulnerabilities in Bitcoin's software that updates can introduce.

""The Bitcoin inflation bug discovered in September 2018 was a big concern to us. The bug could have resulted in a long rollback which could have been highly destructive for the industry and BitMEX. The bug was introduced in Bitcoin Core 0.14.0; therefore, those running earlier versions of Bitcoin Core prior to this could have been able to detect the bug. Therefore the idea behind the website is to connect to many old nodes, such that it can be helpful in detecting bugs not present in older versions, but newly introduced. The website is a work in progress and it may introduce more features going forward,"" he continued.

BitMEX Research took to Twitter to announce its new tool. In the comment section, the company continued to take shots at Craig Wright, whose infamous claiming of Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity has made him a pariah in the industry, for his part in the November 15 fork.

“[Craig Wright’s] (AKA ""Fake Satoshi"") node, Bitcoin SV, is expected to fork off from the network onto a new chain,” the thread reads.

The Twitter thread went on to explicitly state that the focus of Fork Monitor will be to examine Bitcoin’s network, insinuating that the website’s highest priority isn’t necessarily looking to keep precise notes on Bitcoin Cash and its own forks.

Still, the planned date of the BCH hard fork has given BitMEX ample time to build a functional monitoring website that will eventually gather more hard data. At its current stage, Fork Monitor is something of a pilot project, albeit one that “will hopefully provide useful information to some stakeholders” in the future.",Technical,0.8382
2018/11/8,University of Guelph Joins Left to Build Mesh Networks in Canadian North,"The School of Computer Science at the University of Guelph has partnered with an award-winning startup to revolutionize connectivity across Northern Canada.

The Maple Ridge-based tech company Left has teamed up with the University of Guelph to launch a $2.1 million project with Mitacs to spread Mitacs’ patented mobile mesh network to a wide range of remote communities in Canada.

This is the largest partnership the School of Computer Science has ever undertaken, incorporating “120 graduate student internships over five years, from universities across Canada.” Left and Mitacs are providing the majority of the funding for this project, while the cooperation of universities across Canada will lay the groundwork for an ambitious connectivity project.

Mitacs’ platform, RightMesh, operates as a traditional mesh network for internet connectivity. As University of Guelph Professor Jason Ernst put it, mesh networking “allows people to connect with each other using the Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi Direct capabilities built into smartphones, even if those phones are currently offline.”

Essentially, devices which are physically able to connect to the internet are able to act as nodes in an ad hoc network, so that individual devices can connect to these nodes, and these nodes can in turn connect to the internet. As long as the Wi-Fi or Bluetooth-enabled devices are connected to a device that is itself connected to the internet, these devices can tap into the internet off of this connection.

Such an ambitious project was made possible through the combined efforts of these tech companies and the participating universities of Canada. As the press report stated, places like “the Inuit community of Rigolet, Nunatsiavut, where climate change has negatively affected food security, health and wellness, and personal safety” will reap some of the largest benefits.

Rigolet was a testing ground for this project in 2017, and Ernst claimed that it showed great promise in “providing life-saving data without dependence on traditional internet.” Even as traditional infrastructure has been wholly unable to provide this community with reliable access to many comforts of life, hooking into RightMesh has enabled free and decentralized internet access without additional costs. Now, this new partnership will improve access in Rigolet and bring access to many other communities in Northern Canada as well.

Dan Ruimy, a member of the Canadian Parliament, believes it is a good sign that Vancouver-based companies are partnering with companies like Left from elsewhere in Western Canada to bring about such wide innovation. “For many years, Vancouver has been the lone driving force of tech innovation in the area,” said MP Ruimy, adding that this is “a project that helps bridge Canada’s digital divide.” With projects like this, tech innovation and tech access can spread across the nation in multiple ways.",Technical,0.9914
2018/11/16,A New Approach to Thwarting “Selfish” Bitcoin Miners,"Selfish mining is an attack on the Bitcoin network that has been known to be possible for several years. By propagating new blocks slowly (on purpose or by accident), a loophole is opened for miners to unfairly increase their profits in relation to other miners.

However, researchers Cyril Grunspan and Ricardo Pérez-Marco claim that by broadcasting the presence of orphan blocks, selfish mining can become a thing of the past.

Grunspan, a professor at Paris’ ESILV graduate school of engineering, and Pérez-Marco, the director of research at the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) in Paris, have authored a report on the costs of selfish mining and its profitability, which they believe have been largely ignored by the Bitcoin community. As former mathematicians, both men were introduced to Bitcoin in 2011 and developed a lasting taste for it. The authors have worked hard to increase awareness and adoption throughout France and recently organized the Paris Cryptofinance Seminar, which took place in October 2018.

Speaking with Bitcoin Magazine, Pérez-Marco describes selfish mining as a “block-withholding strategy,” and says it was first discovered in 2012 in the BitcoinTalk Forum. Rogue (selfish) miners do not publish mined blocks as indicated by the Bitcoin protocol, but instead try to build an advantage with respect to the official blockchain so they can invalidate a maximum number of honest blocks when releasing their secret chain.

Pérez-Marco says the duo has made two main contributions to the analysis of this problem.

“The first one is to build a correct model for the profitability of the strategy that was lacking, based on the iterative games (inspired from other gambling problems) that account for the profit and loss per unit of time.”

Based on this model, Pérez-Marco says that without a difficulty adjustment, the honest mining strategy still ranks as the most profitable one, as selfish mining tends to be a somewhat costly procedure.

Thus, it follows that most selfish miners do not attack the Bitcoin network itself, but rather attack the difficulty adjustment algorithm, making it easier for them to garner equal rewards with honest miners while using less computing power.

“From this, it became clear that a major bug in the Bitcoin protocol resides in the difficulty adjustment formula,” he comments.

The second contribution they’ve made involves using “martingale theory” to compute the exact formulas for the profitability once the difficulty adjustment formula is accounted for. Martingale is an algebraic principle in which the values of all random variables are equal to each other, so the value of X1+X2 would be equal to Y1+Y2 and Z1+Z2.

“We could also derive new closed-form formulas for the profitability of other block-withholding strategies, like stubborn mining or trail mining that were only studied before numerically,” Pérez-Marco says.

He and his counterpart Grunspan believe an improvement to the Bitcoin protocol to make it immune to selfish mining is necessary. In the paper, the authors introduce a method that they claim can divert many of the effects of selfish mining.

“It is all very simple, indeed,” Pérez-Marco asserts. “Since the damage of selfish mining is done by invalidating or orphaning honest blocks to lower the difficulty artificially, it would be enough to examine this wasted hash rate in the formula for the adjustment of difficulty. We propose a way to do that. Then, the selfish miner will not be able to lower the difficulty, and his strategy will remain non-profitable compared to honest mining.”

In the document, the proposed countermeasures involve peers broadcasting headers of new orphan blocks. These are blocks that get validated but are not included on the official blockchain, and thus represent wasted hash power. Miners then incorporate these headers into their blocks, and the difficulty adjustment formula then integrates the overall production of orphan blocks.

“In this way, the difficulty parameter reflects the true and total hash rate of the network as it was intended by Satoshi Nakamoto,” Pérez-Marco states. “The theorem we proved — that without difficulty adjustment, all other non-honest strategies are non-profitable strategies — is a remarkable fact. To prove this theorem, there was a need for a proper analysis of the profitability. It is hard to imagine how Nakamoto could have foreseen this.”

Pérez-Marco believes that, in the long term, the Bitcoin network will steady itself, and no difficulty adjustments will be necessary. He refers to this idea as the “Bitcoin Stability Theorem” and says that, by using the analysis of their paper, developers can propose BIPs that prevent selfish mining and other block-withholding strategies in the future.",Technical,-0.1779
2018/11/23,One Week Later: The Latest Developments in the Bitcoin Cash Split,"Bitcoin Cash, the “big block” project that forked away from the Bitcoin blockchain in August 2017, “hard forked” (split) into two different coins last week: “Bitcoin Cash ABC” (BCHABC) and “Bitcoin Cash SV” (BCHSV).

One week later, the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain has accumulated more proof of work and has been “ahead” of the Bitcoin Cash SV chain practically since the split. Its native currency, BCHABC, is also trading higher on exchanges. Most Bitcoin Cash ABC proponents, therefore, feel victorious — but not all Bitcoin Cash SV proponents consider the battle to be over just yet.

Here are the main takeaways and latest developments following the Bitcoin Cash split.

Endurance Attack
While some expected a “hash war” to break out between the two chains (not least because nChain chief scientist and Bitcoin SV frontman Craig Steven Wright announced it would), there was no sign of any attacks in the first week after the split. One hint that the Bitcoin Cash SV chain suffered a ""reorg attack"" (a type of 51%-attack where a valid chain is replaced with an alternative valid chain) turned out to be a false alarm — and it was mostly the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain that was threatened with attacks in the first place.

Instead, the “hash war” seems to have turned into what Wright and others call an “endurance attack” or “persistence hunting.” The idea is that while Bitcoin Cash ABC has been able to defend its chain against attacks with hash power, this has been at great cost and cannot last forever. If and when more miners leave the network, the 51%-attack(s) will take place.

Indeed, this looming threat continues to attract an unusual amount of hash power to the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain. Where miners often mine whichever coin is most profitable, more hash power has been securing Bitcoin Cash ABC than the value of its block reward warranted. By estimation, the endurance war has already cost both camps millions of dollars. (The Bitcoin Cash SV chain also attracted an unusual amount of hash power but has not received similar threats.)

Perhaps the Bitcoin Cash ABC camp also wishes to stay ahead in this “hash power race” for other reasons. They might believe it gives them a stronger claim to the “Bitcoin Cash” brand, for example. There’s no technical reason to stay ahead, however. At this point, the two blockchains are completely separate; even if the Bitcoin Cash SV chain were to overtake the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain, both would continue to function normally.

Checkpoint
In an attempt to thwart certain reorg attacks, the Bitcoin ABC development team implemented a new checkpointing system. On top of an initial checkpoint where the new Bitcoin Cash ABC chain started, the latest release of the Bitcoin ABC software client does not allow for blockchain reorgs deeper than 10 blocks. This effectively means that once a transaction has 10 confirmations, the software considers it final. Even if a longer and otherwise valid chain appears, these Bitcoin ABC clients will reject it if more than 10 blocks need to be replaced.

This change is controversial — most importantly because it opens Bitcoin Cash ABC to new attack vectors. While malicious miners could previously only reorg the chain, now they can split it by releasing a long alternative chain at the right moment. If not all Bitcoin Cash ABC users upgrade to accept the new checkpoint rule, the malicious miner can even release a longer alternative chain at any time. Without some level of coordination between users, this could result in two separate currencies, say “Bitcoin Cash ABC Classic” and “Bitcoin Cash ABC Checkpoint” (but this seems like a fairly unlikely scenario).

Furthermore, the new protocol rule was implemented and released without coordination across different Bitcoin Cash ABC development projects, like Bitcoin Unlimited. Not only does this imply centralized governance of the Bitcoin Cash ABC protocol by the Bitcoin ABC development team, but it also makes the aforementioned risks significantly bigger.

Calvin Ayre’s Involvement
Over the weeks and months before the split, most of the more prominent Bitcoin Cash proponents had sided with the Bitcoin ABC faction — though begrudgingly, in some cases. Perhaps the most notable exception to this rule is online gambling tycoon and Coingeek owner Calvin Ayre. Over the past week, Ayre claimed a bigger spotlight.

For one, he openly threatened some of the most prominent proponents of Bitcoin Cash ABC with lawsuits. The gambling tycoon claims that Bitmain cofounder Jihan Wu, Bitcoin ABC lead developer Amaury Séchet, bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver and Kraken CEO Jesse Powell colluded in market manipulation, and he says he has documents to prove it. It’s not exactly clear what these documents might reveal.

Second, Ayre proposed what can be considered a peace offering, endorsed by Wright. If the Bitcoin Cash ABC side of the split implements replay protection, ensuring that users can’t accidentally spend coins on the chain they didn’t mean to, he will leave the coin be. It currently does not seem likely that Bitcoin Cash ABC will implement replay protection, however. Even if it does, it may instead split the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain once again if not all users upgrade, into a chain with and a chain without replay protection.

As such, there is no sign that the looming threats of 51%-attacks will disappear anytime soon.

Settling In
Despite the hostility and relative chaos, both BCHABC and BCHSV are establishing themselves as standalone cryptocurrencies. This includes the adoption of distinct names and ticker symbols, though these still vary between exchanges and other users. Most of the existing Bitcoin Cash infrastructure has adopted Bitcoin Cash ABC as the new “Bitcoin Cash.” But infrastructure for Bitcoin Cash SV is coming online as well, such as a block explorer. In the meantime, Bitcoin Cash SV has also mined several blocks that exceed 32 megabytes, setting it apart from Bitcoin Cash ABC (though not without issues).

Price action has not been favorable for either coin, however. While it’s hard to tell for sure (and there are often multiple coinciding reasons), the threat of a hash war appeared to have triggered a large selloff of the BCH markets — seemingly taking the broader cryptocurrency markets down in its fall.

This selloff continued throughout the week. Where BCH was trading around $600 one week before the split, BCHABC ($195) and BCHSV ($45) are trading at a combined $240, at the time of writing. This constitutes a combined drop of about 60 percent. Still, BCHABC maintains the fourth spot on coin-ranking websites, previously held by BCH. BCHSV has not been fully integrated into such charts yet, but at current rates (at the time of writing) it is poised to take 13th spot.",Technical,-0.9952
2018/12/4,Bitcoin’s Tech Trends of 2018: What This Year Brought Us (Part 1),"Where 2017’s dizzying price highs embedded “hodl” into the public consciousness, 2018 was the year that “buidl"" became a trend in the crypto-industry — and Bitcoin was no exception.

Anticipated in Bitcoin Magazine’s first cover story of the year, Bitcoin’s technological progress only accelerated in 2018. Improving Bitcoin from around the world, developers and entrepreneurs furthered Segregated Witness adoption, rolled out the Lightning Network, released privacy solutions, realized sidechains and made progress on a Schnorr signature solution — all of which were still around the corner only a year ago.

Following up on January’s cover story, 2018’s closing two-parter cover story explores how these five technologies progressed.

In part one: Segregated Witness and the Lightning Network.

Segregated Witness
The Segregated Witness (SegWit) soft fork that activated in August 2017 was arguably Bitcoin’s biggest protocol upgrade to date. Fixing the long-standing malleability bug, it better enabled second-layer protocols while replacing Bitcoin’s block size limit with a block weight limit. Transactions that utilize SegWit are partly stored in a new part of Bitcoin blocks, allowing the network to process more than one megabyte of transaction data per 10 minutes.

Back in 2017, SegWit adoption was off to a somewhat slow start. By the end of the year, most wallets had not integrated the upgrade yet — and not many exchanges or other Bitcoin service providers had either. At the start of this year, less than 15 percent of transactions utilized the additional block space, and blocks barely exceeded 1.1 megabytes.

Throughout 2018, however, adoption increased quite a bit, as more wallets and services implemented SegWit. This perhaps most notably included the Bitcoin Core wallet, which enabled SegWit transactions with its 0.16.0 release in March. Other popular wallets, such as Coinomi (March), Bither (September) and BRD (November) followed suit, while Mycelium is expected to roll out the feature before the end of the year. Some of the biggest Bitcoin service providers also implemented Segregated Witness in 2018, including Coinbase (February), Bitfinex (February) and Xapo (May).

As an overall result, SegWit usage statistics increased to well over 40 percent over the year. Still, while about a threefold increase, this is lower than some would have expected it to be by now.

“I'd say the main reason SegWit usage isn’t well over 50 percent by now is inertia,” Coinmetrics data analyst Antoine Le Calvez speculated when asked by Bitcoin Magazine. “If you didn't adopt it when fees exploded last year — either due to lack of time or other priorities — I don't think you'd support it until fees explode again, when SegWit transactions will have a clear cost advantage over non-SegWit transactions.”

On top of SegWit itself, the new bech32 address format also saw its first non-trivial adoption in 2018. These addresses, that start with “bc1” instead of a 1 or a 3, are a natural fit for SegWit. Transactions from such addresses require less data to be included in a block and are, therefore, even cheaper. Several wallets — like Coinomi, Electrum and Wasabi — moved straight to this new format.

The popular BRD wallet for iOS and Android did this too and, in September, even launched a campaign to further bech32 adoption: “When SegWit?”

“We've always taken the stance that bech32 stood the best chance of being the gold standard for SegWit implementation,” said BRD CSO Aaron Lasher, in explaining the idea behind the initiative to Bitcoin Magazine. “The backwards compatibility of using P2SH-enabled SegWit gave the industry a much-needed jump start, but to really drive adoption, raw SegWit is the way to go.”

He continued:

“As one of the larger wallets, we enjoy an element of influence over the state of the network, as a non-trivial percentage of bitcoin transactions are conducted through BRD wallets. Getting wallets and other service providers to upgrade their software to interact with bech32 addresses is the goal in general, and with this initiative we're targeting them in a respectful and persuasive manner.”

Perhaps thanks to the campaign, in part, and on top of SegWit adoption itself, bech32 use increased throughout 2018 as well.

""5.6 percent of the outputs created these days are bech32 outputs,"" Le Calvez said, “though bech32 outputs store only ~0.8 percent of all bitcoin, so it means that bech32 users are quite active. That could be because Coinbase and LocalBitcoins support it, and exchanges attract arbitrageurs that move money around faster. Another reason could be that, since bech32 is the cheapest way to transact, it attracts high-activity users.”

All in all, Bitcoin blocks have grown along with SegWit adoption over the past year. While average numbers aren’t quite as telling (because not all blocks fill up in the first place), the typical full block today is around 1.3 megabytes. The biggest Bitcoin block to date was also mined this year, in October by ViaBTC, and was a little over 2.3 megabytes.

The Lightning Network
Highly anticipated for years, 2018 was the year that the Lightning Network made its “official” debut. Although the risky nature of early stage tech was conveyed through the #reckless hashtag, regular users were invited to try out Bitcoin’s overlay network for fast and cheap transactions for the first time.

In March, Lightning Labs was the first to announce the beta release of Ind, the software implementation it’s spearheading, and collected a $2.5 million seed investment round to boot. This was followed by the beta release of ACINQ’s eclair later that same month and Blockstream’s c-lightning in June. Since September, Casa even lets you host a physical Lightning node in your home: the Casa Node. In conjunction, several Lightning wallets were made available, and even more of them are coming, including some from established Bitcoin wallet providers like Trezor and Electrum.

Probably at least as important, Lightning payments are increasingly accepted for real goods and services.

One of the very earliest adopters of the Lightning Network was a prepaid top-up service Bitrefill, in March of this year. CEO Sergej Kotliar has been keeping a close eye on Lightning Network usage since, telling Bitcoin Magazine:

“We’ve processed 2,170 regular Lightning orders at this point, receiving a total of 6.3 bitcoin. The share of Lightning payments is steadily growing and is currently at about 2.5 percent of our bitcoin orders. We’re generally waiting on two things for this to take off bigly: more wallets and exchange integration.”

While it was not very necessary this year, as Bitcoin fees have been negligible for most of 2018, Kotliar also tracked how many on-chain transactions were avoided by using the Lightning Network.

“I basically added up all channels, opened and closed, and how many payments and forwards have been made, as a sort of measure of scaling efficiency,” he explained. “This adds up to 2.75 payments per on-chain transaction, and 3.46 payments per on-chain transaction, if we include forwarded Lightning transactions. This number grew steadily over the past couple of months as channel reliability improves and the network grows.”

Besides Bitrefill, other pioneering adopters included the Blockstream store (since January) and bill payment service Living Room of Satoshi (since April). Payment processor BTCPay integrated Lightning payments in July, offering it to all its users (like TorGuard VPN and Coincards). So did payment provider CoinGate in September, on-boarding the Lamassu Bitcoin ATM network, bullion store Bitgild, and hundreds more merchants. And the first exchange started to accept Lightning payments for deposits in 2018 as well: gold-to-bitcoin exchange Vaultoro (since May). [Edit: Payment processor GloBee also started accepting Lightning payments, in June.]

At least as impressive was the level of community involvement in such a new technology. Berlin-based Lightning startup Fulmo, for example, organized a series of popular “Hackdays”: three in the German capital and one in New York. Developers and anyone else with interest could come and learn about the technology and build on it on the spot. Also in New York, Bitcoin development company Chaincode Labs focused its third “Bitcoin Residency” program on the Lightning Network, too.

As an entirely new phenomenon, and partly the result of these events, a number of Lightning apps (“Lapps”) were introduced over the course of the year.

""Lightning has enabled people to build lots of cool things with bitcoin and it's unlocking a whole new potential. Things that we haven't even thought of today,"" Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark told Bitcoin Magazine. ""Every day we wake up and someone has built something new.""

Stark's Lightning Labs has tried to keep track of available Lapps in its Lightning App Directory. Examples include a jukebox, a tipping solution and a file-hosting solution, all powered by Blockstream’s micropayment processing system Lightning Charge, showcased during the company’s “Week of Lapps” in March. Another particularly useful Lapp that launched this year is Submarine Swaps, which allows users to pay Lightning invoices even without having a Lightning wallet Further, the hackdays produced photobooths, point of sale payment processors and games. And the Lightning Network even saw the emergence of what can arguably be considered its first “killer app”: The million-dollar, homepage-inspired, web graffiti platform satoshis.place went viral through Bitcoin social media last summer.

All this activity translated into data, too. Although publicly available Lightning Network statistics are not completely reliable — some aspects of the network are hard or impossible to measure — various Lightning Network explorers show that there are several thousand Lightning nodes online on any day. Between them, they have more than 10 thousand payment channels open, holding hundreds of bitcoins worth almost two million dollars, and all this is growing fast.

In the meantime, code supporting the Lightning Network is only improving, and more parts of the protocol are being fleshed out. In November, a group of Lightning developers from different implementations met for a second Lightning Summit in Adelaide, Australia — after the first one in Milan in 2016. Here, the “BOLT” Lightning Network specification made a leap forward, paving the way for more innovation for 2019 and beyond.

“The second Lightning Summit reaffirmed that this is an open community interested in moving a common vision of an open network forward,” said Blockstream and c-lightning developer Christian Decker. “It puts all the things that we postponed in the first meeting back on the table and opens up a second exploratory phase for all the nice-to-have features. Splicing and multipath routing for example allow us to hide all the details about channel allocations of funds: the user just sees a single balance that is available both off- and on-chain.”

2018/12/12,The Lightning Network's First ERC-20 to Bitcoin Atomic Swap Has Taken Place,"At the December 7, 2018, TenX Summit, a group of developers showcased an industry first: an atomic swap on the Lightning Network between a non-native asset, TenX’s PAY token, and a native asset, bitcoin.

By non-native, the team is referring to an asset/coin that is not the base currency for the network. For Ethereum, for example, the native asset is ether, while any token that is built on the protocol is considered a non-native asset.

CoBloX, a TenX research and development lab, is responsible for the achievement. Demonstrating their work to a tightly packed audience of summit goers, the team used the Lightning Network and their open-source software COMIT to swap 10 PAY for 71,240 satoshis. The team published a blog post on December 12, 2018, to confirm the news and satify what it calls “the gossip factory” of he-said-she-said following the summit.

In the post, the team delves into their process, explaining outright that this swap was not as simple as the first-ever ether and bitcoin atomic swap on the Lightning Network, which they tested nearly six months ago. Whereas this swap’s hashed time lock contract (HTLC) only required a single use smart contract, the PAY to bitcoin swap took an extra step.

Reason being, the PAY token itself is managed with an additional smart contract known as the transfer ownership function. Because of this, the HTLC had to be separated into two transactions: one to deploy the swap contract and another as a transfer call for the PAY tokens.

“Unfortunately, we couldn’t figure out how to combine these two steps. The ERC20 transfer function uses msg.sender for authentication. However, calling transfer from a contract deployment sets msg.sender to the address of the yet-to-be-deployed contract which obviously has no tokens,” the blog post reads.

Having used the Lightning Network Daemon (LND) implementation for the swap, the team continues to explain in the blog post that the swap is a one-way ticket. They could only execute the trade by starting with the ERC-20 token and going through Lightning — not the other way around.

“An atomic swap cannot always be expressed through this model of invoices and payments. In LND, which is what we used for our PoC, receiving a payment requires an invoice which requires knowledge of the secret. As a result, we were only able to do ERC20 to Lightning and not the other way around.”

The technical milestone is the latest in CoBloX’s technical successes. As mentioned previously, the team also completed the world’s first ether and bitcoin swap. The young lab’s GitHub also features a couple of Rust clients for a Bitcoin Core interface and a JsonRPC API plug-in, as well as a tool for testing blockchain applications.

COMIT, the software used in the ERC-20 swap, is also open-source. With a focus on blockchain interoperability, COMIT is meant to act as a bridge between networks to facilitate cross-chain asset swaps. In addition to the work that has been done with Ethereum and its ERC-20 tokens, the team plans to expand its use with additional features and currencies down the road.

An earlier version of this article misrepresented the swap as the first of its kind, failing to specify that it was the first on the Lightning Network. The Komodo platform performed the industry's first successful ether to bitcoin and ERC-20 to bitcoin atomic swaps earlier in 2018.

2018/12/17,"Blockstream Satellites Now Cover Asia Pacific, Send Messages With Lightning","While most crypto investors are shooting for the moon, Blockstream is focused on things a bit closer to Earth: in the outermost layer of its atmosphere, to be exact.

Blockstream’s Bitcoin satellites are something out of science fiction. Orbiting in our planet’s exosphere, the spacecrafts broadcast the Bitcoin blockchain across the globe. Anyone can access the network with a simple satellite receiver — no internet required — putting the Bitcoin blockchain in reach for the world’s population from the limits of the Earth’s atmosphere.

And with the project’s latest update, this reach is going even further.

Formerly servicing only North America, South America, Europe and Africa, the initiative now services the Asia-Pacific region as well, marking Blockstream’s latest attempt to make its satellites’ coverage global. The update also comes with a new messaging feature that allows the satellites’ users to broadcast messages from the satellite and pay for these data transmission with Lightning Network micropayments.

“Four satellites are currently active, with coverage over North and South America, Europe, Africa, and now Asia Pacific. More will be added in the future to complete global coverage,” Chris Cook, the project’s head, told Bitcoin Magazine.

Launched in August of 2017, the Blockstream satellite program originated from a desire to make Bitcoin more accessible to those who lack a reliable internet connection. The commercial satellites, whose bandwidth Blockstream leases, receive data from full nodes that Blockstream operates on earth, and they re-broadcast this data across the globe. 

With the scope of its services now expanding, Cook indicated that accessing Bitcoin Network functions from the satellite carries security and accessibility benefits as opposed to tapping into nodes on the ground. Most notably, he sees potential to expose Bitcoin to those who would otherwise have trouble accessing the network, as well as security benefits for those who decide to set up a wallet through one of the satellites.

“The benefits include prevention of network partitioning, the ability to use bitcoin in remote areas where internet connectivity may be limited, and it can also be a way to have a secure, fully synced node for a wallet (as it’s receive-only, [there’s] no risk of getting hacked).”

The update also comes with a Lightning Network-powered messaging feature. Users can broadcast messages through one Blockstream’s satellites and pay for this data transmission per kilobyte using Bitcoin’s Lightning Network. Cook said that these broadcast costs “are very low, which make them more suited to Lightning payments” rather than primary network transactions.

While the service could be used to broadcast any simple message, the team hopes that users will get creative with its functionality.

“Natural disaster notifications, secure personal messaging, and sending bitcoin market data to remote locations are just some of the exciting examples of the power of this service,” Cook commented in a statement.

Updates to API access for the new services are expected to go live in January of 2019.

As for other forthcoming features for the satellites, Cook revealed that Blockstream has a lot in the works but that he couldn’t reveal specifics. He did, however, end the interview with a note of optimism for how the program might impact (and expand) the Bitcoin community in the future.

“The primary goal is to benefit the global bitcoin community by improving the network’s resilience, increasing global availability, and inspiring greater bitcoin adoption. It’s a mission without end, but if it prevents even a single network interruption or leads to just one more person being able to access and use bitcoin, then it is a success. There’s plenty more exciting stuff in the works though, starting with the API launching in January.”

2018/12/18,Pierre Rochard: “Lightning Adoption Will Basically Mirror Bitcoin Adoption”,"Lightning is a second-layer solution for the Bitcoin blockchain that addresses the scaling issues surrounding it today.

Similar to Bitcoin, Lightning is an open-source protocol in which anyone can contribute to. Whether it is through programming and developing applications or setting up a node, participation in Lightning is not just accessible. It’s welcomed.

The Lightning community is already vibrant and growing every day. Pierre Rochard is one person who has already cemented his place in the Bitcoin community as a strong advocate for the digital currency, founding the Bitcoin Advisory in 2013. More recently, his work with Lightning has garnered plenty of attention through his suite of Lightning applications. Specifically, Rochard’s Lightning plug-in integration for Microsoft Excel showed the world that Lightning has a place in commonly used applications.

The Lightning plug-in uses neutrino, a sidechain solution whose purpose is to allow for interaction with Bitcoin’s global transaction history without downloading the entire blockchain. Specifically, neutrino was designed to facilitate this on devices with low-power processors, limited storage or bandwidth, and intermittent power — essentially, a good fit for an Excel spreadsheet.

As for the use-case of this application, Rochard has mentioned in the past that it is for “power users” who are highly familiar with the technologies being used and not for the everyday user. Nonetheless, its general purpose is to send Lightning payments from an Excel spreadsheet.

Rochard’s suite of Lightning applications is a testament to the progress being made in developing Bitcoin’s second-layer solution in the first year of its existence. In the following interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Rochard discusses his Lightning plugin as well as the bigger picture of Lightning as it relates to the global adoption of Bitcoin.

In the months since he announced that this plugin can run a full node within the spreadsheet. Rochard has created a node launcher GUI to help people set up a Lightning and Bitcoin node locally for the plugin to connect.

“My initial experimentation with the Excel plugin was that it would have a Lightning node bundled with it and running inside of it, using Neutrino instead of a full node,” said Rochard. But there was a problem with that set-up. Neutrino is not implemented on mainnet, so it can’t be used with real bitcoins yet, meaning that no one would be able to use the Excel plugin with real bitcoins.

Neutrino versus Full Node
Satoshi’s white paper describes a process called “simple payment verification” (SPV). But SPVs have never actually been implemented.

Instead, Rochard explains, the Bitcoin community has settled for “compromises that are SPV-ish.”

Right now, using this compromise process, a wallet will send a list of transaction IDs to a node and query all information relating to those transaction IDs. The trick is that not all of those transaction IDs that the SPV wallet is sending to the node are actually from the SPV wallet. Instead, the list includes a bunch of random information in addition to the actual queries it's actually interested in. This action is meant to preserve some privacy since the node doesn’t know which piece of information is the specific piece it is looking for. It just knows it’s somewhere in there, hidden in a crowd of other bits of information.

Still, however, Rochard pointed out that few mobile wallets actually implemented this process. “Instead, most of them are basically contacting a trusted server that is just the specific addresses that its interested in and then it receives information back on this. So that provides zero privacy.”

With Neutrino, the full node sends what’s called a “block filter,” which is essentially a short summary of a bitcoin block, to the “light client” and checks if specific transactions or addresses of interest have a match in this filter.

“If they do,” said Rochard, “then we’re going to request the full block and download that and then extract the data from it. So that, essentially, means you have way more privacy because now the full node doesn’t know what specific transactions in that block got your interest because there’s thousands of transactions in a block.”

Of course, Neutrino isn’t as secure as the Bitcoin blockchain itself. Specifically, it doesn’t validate all protocol rules, it just checks the transactions in a specific block. In other words, it doesn’t verify the 21 million bitcoin limit, which opens up doors to compromises on security.

“I would strongly emphasize that there is simply no substitute for running your own full node,” said Rochard. “Really, the Neutrino functionality is kind of a convenience/UX improvement, but it it does compromise on the properties of Bitcoin.” That was the other motivation for this node launcher that Rochard created. He wants the people with the bandwidth capabilities to run a full node to be able to do so.

“I think that we should have the UI for every platform and in every programming language and we should really have as many UIs as possible. As it relates to which ones are going to be most used, that's an area where I want maximum amount of competition and where really I embrace pluralism and would be against tribalism, which is unusual for me because I'm usually very tribalistic with my Bitcoin maximalism.”

When it comes to the Lightning UI, however, Rochard is far less “tribalistic.”

“I'm an alt-UI, Multi UI proponent, and the reason is that we're going to want to onboard the full spectrum of users. From people who are using Lightning on their mobile wallet, to the people that are using Lightning in a Chrome extension with Joule to people who are using Lightning in an Excel spreadsheet with my plugin. Wherever the user is most comfortable and wherever it is most practical and simple for them, I want there to be a wallet for them.”

The Future of Lightning: Overcoming Bottlenecks to Adoption
“I think that Lightning's adoption is going to basically mirror bitcoin’s adoption; and bitcoin’s adoption comes from a very grassroots source. It's not like a top-down thing,” said Rochard. “We've even seen Bitcoin businesses emerge from grassroots users for the most part. Someone becomes a Bitcoin enthusiast [gets] into the ecosystem and then starts a Bitcoin-related service where they see a gap. That's kind of been the general path.”

Rochard projects that the growth of Lightning will follow a similar path, but first, users will need tools that allow them to work with the protocol.

“You have people who are Bitcoin enthusiasts who are like, ‘Oh, what's this neat, layer-two, offchain network that people are buzzing about on Twitter? I'm gonna go check that out. Now, I use Windows — I have no technical capabilities and I don't know how to use a command line, so I can't get on Lightning today. Oh, Pierre came out with a node launcher. Okay, now I can get on Lightning.’

“And that's that's how the process is going to happen. At first it's going to be ten people, then a hundred people and then a thousand people.”

Adoption Through Infrastructure
Participating in a recent Lightning residency at Chaincode Labs was a pivotal moment for Rochard and turned him from being “cautiously bullish” to a “cult-member, indoctrinated-fanatic” of Lightning.

There, he met a software developer at Bitmex who gave the impression that, while Lightning was on Bitmex’s radar, it wasn’t a priority from a development perspective.

“Now within the next couple of years, they're going to have a Lightning feature,” Rochard suggested. “That much is clear. So, I think that, you know, it's not within the next six months but within the next few years, exchanges are going to have Lightning features.

“Now the question is: How useful are these? Because if it's to deposit $20 worth of bitcoins, that's not useful for anyone. On top of figuring out how useful this is for exchanges, it's just too early right now. If we want thousands of dollars being transacted on Lightning in payments, we need to have atomic multipaths worked out among other things.”

Looking ahead, Rochard said that, when it comes to exchanges, Lightning adoption will continue to evolve; users will find themselves using bitcoin on-chain in the meantime. In the future, however, as the capacity of the Lightning Network increases, using Lightning for everyday transactions on exchanges will become automatic.

“In five years, it’s going to the the case that you’re no longer going to be able to use bitcoin at an exchange without using Lightning, but that’s much longer term.”",Technical,0.997
2018/12/18,Syncing Data Between Bitcoin Nodes Is About to Get Easier,"Minisketch is a new solution that’s trying to solve an old problem.

Spearheaded by Blockstream co-founder Pieter Wuille, Bitcoin Core contributor and fellow Blockstream co-founder Gregory Maxwell, and Blockstream software engineer Gleb Naumenko, the open-source initiative is designed to achieve set reconciliation between the mempools of each full node.

“Set reconciliation, in short, is the problem of trying to figure out what the differences are between two sets stored on different computers, while minimizing how much data needs to be exchanged between them. In particular, it’s trying to do so while sending less data than the entire set of data,” Wuille told Bitcoin Magazine

For Bitcoin, this means discerning the differences in transaction data between nodes. Maxwell likened set reconciliation to the process of syncing your phone’s contact list with another person who has many of the same contacts.

“You could send them your whole list but it won’t fit on a postcard and would be pretty wasteful in any case, since they already know most of the contacts … It is possible, in fact, to communicate your whole set of contacts to them by sending only as much information as the size of the difference between your lists even without any idea in advance of what the actual differences are,” Maxwell told Bitcoin Magazine.

In short, set reconciliation would reduce the bandwidth required to run a full node on the Bitcoin network by minimizing how much data each node transmits to each other. This would effectively allow nodes to sync up the data in their mempools more efficiently.

Breaking Down Set Reconciliation
The problem that minisketch wants to amend isn’t blockchain specific.

Set reconciliation is a constant frustration that any distributed system grapples with. Writ large, it simply means that two or more parties on a distributed network hold different sets of data, and to reconcile this, they must figure out which pieces of the data they’re missing — as well as which pieces they have that the other party lacks.

For Bitcoin, these data are transactions. These transactions are relayed from node to node until they are picked up by miners to be included into new blocks.

The problem is that the order of transactions can vary from mempool to mempool (the queues that list incoming transactions to be included into new blocks). This means that there can be (and usually is) a discrepancy in the order of transactions between mempools and newly relayed blocks.

“Bitcoin nodes have a … problem when relaying transactions between each other. Any given node will have mostly the same transactions as any one of its peers — received from other links, but not exactly the same. Today nodes waste a lot of bandwidth just figuring out who needs to be sent what [data],” Maxwell said.

How Minisketch Closes the Gap
An implementation of the PinSketch algorithm, minisketch constructs a library of data to be used for constructing set sketches (i.e., for this use case, sets of transaction data). Nodes and miners can then use these sets for compact set reconciliation.

Simply put, the solution would allow node operators to compare notes on transaction data. It would allow them to sketch (create) sets (lists) of transactions, and the program would cross-check these sets to see which data occurs in one but not both sets. Instead of spending time and energy revealing all of this data to each other, though, with minisketch, nodes only need to know the difference between their transaction sets to sketch a full set.

As Wuille explained, it would look like this in practice:

“If we simplify it to just a single difference, it’s easy to see how this may work:

Say I have the set {3,5,7,11}, and you have the set {3,5,7,9,11}, so the difference is {9}.
We both compute the sum of our elements, so I obtain 3+5+7+11=26, and you obtain 3+5+7+9+11=35.
I send my sum 26 to you, and you subtract it from your sum; the difference is 9.
“This works, but it is restricted to finding a single difference. Minisketch generalizes this by sending various types of ‘sums’ of the data. The result is that with N different sums, you can find N differences … As long as the number of differences between the sets is not more than the number of ‘sums’ sent, minisketch will always succeed in finding all the differences.”

If successfully implemented, this set reconciliation could make transaction relay between nodes more efficient. Along with other in-the-works improvements to Bitcoin’s infrastructure, this could reduce each node’s broadcasting burden by a significant margin, Maxwell said.

“I made a measurement a while back and found that transaction relay was about 87 percent of a node’s bandwidth usage. This was before compact blocks, so the number is potentially greater now. Our simulation results indicate that we might be able to cut relay overheads by the order of 40x through a combination of improvements that include minisketch.”

According to Wuille, the minisketch solution could also create “a more robust network.” Maxwell expanded on this line of thinking by indicating that with the protocol, nodes could use their saved bandwidth to connect with 16 to 24 other nodes instead of the standard 8, “which would make some theoretical attacks even harder to pull off without using more bandwidth,” he claimed.

Maxwell is also hopeful that one day, minisketch could be used to revamp block propagation as well. “There have been other protocols for block propagation using IBLT (Invertible Bloom Lookup Table) that minisketch would make a lot better,” he said, though he admitted that such a solution is “not urgent” because “[compact] blocks already make block transfer itself use only about 4MB per node per day, so even if improvements reduced that number to nothing it wouldn’t make that big of a difference to users or the network.” Instead, he envisions this solution being more useful for “very low transmission like Blockstream’s satellite.”

Wuille indicated that minisketch will reduce node bandwidth requirements and have a higher success probability than IBLT, but he conceded that for larger data sets, IBLT would be faster. Maxwell added that “IBLT is very inefficient for less than a few hundred differences,” while minisketch is more efficient for smaller data sets.

Minisketch is still very much in the preliminary stages, however; Wuille stated that an actual BIP is a while away and that adoption is subject to a number of factors.

Reiterating his observations to a point, Maxwell noted that the protocol is also not part of Bitcoin’s network consensus. If any node operators felt comfortable enough and wanted to try to improve their transaction relays, they could choose to use minisketch even without its ubiquitous adoption on the network.

“One useful point is that relay mechanisms are not a part of the Bitcoin consensus. You and I could start using an improved protocol between us regardless of what other people choose to do. This means that improvements to relay are only delayed by ordinary protocol/software engineering considerations — we have to build it, verify it, integrate it, etc. —  but unlike a consensus change, it doesn’t depend on anyone agreeing to it except the people who choose to use it.”",Technical,0.4215
2018/12/19,Bitcoin’s Tech Trends of 2018: What This Year Brought Us (Part 2),"This is the second part of our December cover story. Click here for part 1.

Where 2017’s dizzying price highs embedded “hodl” into the public consciousness, 2018 was the year that “buidl"" became a trend in the crypto-industry — and Bitcoin was no exception.

Anticipated in Bitcoin Magazine’s first cover story of the year, Bitcoin’s technological progress only accelerated in 2018. Improving Bitcoin from around the world, developers and entrepreneurs furthered Segregated Witness adoption, rolled out the Lightning Network, released privacy solutions, realized sidechains and made progress on a Schnorr signature solution — all of which were still around the corner only a year ago.

Following up on January’s cover story, 2018’s closing two-parter cover story explores how these five technologies progressed.

In part two: privacy, sidechains and Schnorr signatures.

Privacy Solutions
Two of the most promising privacy solutions that were proposed over the past few years — TumbleBit and ZeroLink — were both on the verge of release at the start of this year.

TumbleBit is a coin-mixing protocol first proposed in 2016 by an academic research team led by Boston University’s Ethan Heilman. TumbleBit uses a (centralized) mixer to create off-chain payment channels between several participants in a mixing session. Everyone ends up with each others’ coins, breaking the transaction trail for all. Importantly, clever cryptographic tricks ensure that even the mixer can’t establish a link between the users and their transactions.

Excited by this potential, NBitcoin developer Nicolas Dorier and privacy-focused Bitcoin developer Ádám Ficsór (as well as several others) went a long way toward implementing the solution in the two years after it was first proposed. In early 2017, Stratis, the company behind the Stratis platform and token, even hired Ficsór to implement the technology in its Breeze wallet, which also supports bitcoin.

However, back in July 2017, Ficsór had come to doubt the real-world potential of TumbleBit. The solution needs a relatively large number of on-chain transactions for each mixing session, potentially making it cumbersome and expensive to use.

“I did not and I do not think anyone else ever thought through TumbleBit’s Classic Tumbler’s economics as I did now, in a high Bitcoin fee environment where we are inevitably going towards,” Ficsór wrote in a Medium blog post at the time. “To be completely honest, after I wrote all these down I became pretty disillusioned.”

Ficsór and Stratis did complete the project. After years of high anticipation, TumbleBit was finally released in the Breeze Wallet in August of this year. But by then most of the enthusiasm around the project seemed to have waned. Breeze’s TumbleBit stayed off the radar of many, and because of that, usage statistics are presumably low.

Instead, much of the effort to realize a more private Bitcoin shifted to the other major privacy solution: ZeroLink. Based on “Chaumian CoinJoin,” first proposed by Bitcoin Core contributor Gregory Maxwell in 2013, ZeroLink is a privacy framework first announced in August 2017 by the same Ádám Ficsór.

ZeroLink allows several users to mix their coins in a big transactions that sends coins from all participants in a mixing session to all other participants. It has similar requirements (a central server) and benefits (breaks the trail of transaction) as TumbleBit, but Ficsór believes the trade-offs are preferable, most notably because ZeroLink requires fewer on-chain transactions.

To realize ZeroLink, Ficsór set up his own Bitcoin privacy-focused company this year, zkSNACKs, which he first publicly revealed at the Building on Bitcoin conference in Lisbon in July.

A rebrand of his initial “Hidden Wallet” project, zkSNACKs’ flagship product is the Wasabi Wallet, a desktop wallet with additional privacy features based on the ZeroLink framework. Besides Chaumian CoinJoin, this, for example, includes compact-client side block filtering: a privacy enhancing solution for light clients that don’t download the entire Bitcoin blockchain.

The Wasabi Wallet was officially released on October 31 of this year, on the Bitcoin white paper’s 10th birthday. While still far from mainstream, Wasabi Wallet has already become the go-to privacy option for many of those that care about privacy the most. According to GitHub statistics, the wallet was downloaded thousands of times in the first few months since its release. And, according to the Wasabi Wallet’s website, it has mixed almost two thousand coins already.

“Honestly, I've been astonished by the user growth and social media activity. If this keeps up we will finally be able to think about liquidity dependent privacy solutions, for example to allow direct sends through mixing,” Ficsór told Bitcoin Magazine. “Exciting times.”

The ZeroLink framework is being adopted as a standard by other wallets as well. The new (and so far relatively unknown) Bob Wallet announced in March that it is developing a ZeroLink implementation. In August, privacy-focused Samourai Wallet announced a mobile ZeroLink implementation called Whirlpool. And Stratis’ Breeze Wallet initially showed interest as well.

On top of TumbleBit and ZeroLink, more privacy solutions were rolled out this year, and even more are in development. For a full overview of privacy technologies that were released in 2018 or currently in development, see Bitcoin Magazine’s September cover story: Bitcoin as a Privacycoin: This Tech is Making Bitcoin More Private.

Stratis (the company behind the Breeze wallet) did not respond to a request for comment on this story.

Sidechains
A highly anticipated technology for several years now, sidechains are alternative blockchains with coins pegged to bitcoins. This allows users to effectively “move” bitcoins across blockchains, allowing them to operate under different protocol rules, for example to enable faster confirmation times or to provide more privacy. In essence, sidechains would offer all the technical benefits of altcoins while maintaining Bitcoin’s 21 million coin limit.

Liquid
While the blockchain development company has since expanded its mission, Blockstream was originally founded in 2014 around the concept of sidechains. Since 2016, it has maintained “Elements,” an open-source sidechain project that showcases what’s possible with the technology. But Blockstream’s first, commercial sidechain project is Liquid, which was announced in 2015.

Liquid is designed to offer a payment rail between exchanges and other service providers, to let traders quickly and privately move funds around and take advantage of arbitrage opportunities. This minimizes spreads across exchanges and increases liquidity across the industry. Called a “federated sidechain,” coins and transactions on the sidechain are secured by a selection of the exchanges and service providers: They are the gatekeepers that move funds from Bitcoin’s blockchain to the sidechain and back.

In October of this year, Blockstream launched Liquid, with its bitcoin-pegged token L-BTC. One month later, it introduced nodes, wallets and a block explorer to the public. Liquid is secured by some of the best-known companies in the industry, including Bitfinex, BitMEX, Xapo, Unocoin, Bitso and dozens others. Italian bitcoin exchange The Rock Trading offered Liquid on- and off-ramps almost immediately after the sidechain launched, and in late November, Bitfinex CSO Paolo Ardoino also indicated Liquid support will be rolled out soon.

Judging by publicly available statistics, Liquid usage is still modest: Some 25 bitcoin are locked up at the time of writing this article, which required 75 transactions to do so. The sidechain processed about 3,400 transactions in total, which amounts to less than a dozen transactions per hour. But the long-awaited technology is live — and growing.

“It’s a good start,” said Blockstream CSO Samson Mow. “We only recently released the client, so it’s about what I would expect. As we have more exchanges exposing integration to their end users, we should see a lot more traffic.”

RSK
Another federated Bitcoin sidechain is RSK, with the bitcoin-pegged token R-BTC. RSK is specifically designed to support Ethereum-style, Turing-complete smart contracts. Like Liquid, coins on RSK are secured by a group of established Bitcoin companies. But unlike Liquid, RSK is also merged-mined with Bitcoin, which means that bitcoin miners use their hash power to create blocks and confirm transactions.

“This ‘two chambers’ idea results in strong security because no single group has too much power and each group has specific responsibility,” said Sergio Lerner, co-founder and chief scientist of RSK Labs, the company building and supporting RSK’s reference implementation. “And like in Bitcoin itself, users of the platform ultimately control the destiny of the protocol.”

In January, the Genesis block was mined and RSK was officially launched. An early announcement suggests that companies in the federation include Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Bitpay, Xapo and BitGo — though RSK has not yet revealed which companies are part of today’s federation, exactly. (A joint public announcement will follow soon.) RSK has also attracted several of Bitcoin’s biggest mining pools: BTC.com, AntPool, Slush Pool and F2pool are merge-mining the sidechain already, accounting for over 50 percent of Bitcoin’s hash power. The R-BTC token is available on exchanges including Bitfinex and Huobi, and the RSK platform itself has been improved a lot as well, said Lerner: RSK performed nine releases throughout 2018 from version 0.4.0 to the current version 0.5.3.

Perhaps even more importantly, according to RSK Labs some 50 projects are by now working on the RSK sidechain that RSK Labs is keeping track of — though most of the projects are, of course, still in very early stages or still in development.

Some of the more notable RSK projects are developed by RSK Labs itself, as well as by RIF Labs, the company that acquired RSK Labs in November. These include a Lightning-like payment channel network called Lumino (which, while incompatible in design, could be bridged to Bitcoin’s main Lightning Network). RIF Labs recently launched the RIF OS project, which is a range of open-source protocols and libraries that will initially run over RSK, which includes a payment network, peer-to-peer storage, name resolution and more.

“The RSK community is expanding, mostly in Latin America and Asia,” Lerner told Bitcoin Magazine, “and we’ve seen an acceleration in the past few months of companies launching solutions built on top of RSK. Further, in 2018 there were over a 100 RSK meetups and conferences around the world. RSK Labs also has an ambassador program to track the ecosystem growth: There are currently 200+ certified ambassadors and over a 1,000 in certification process.”

Drivechains
Finally, a test-version of a drivechain — a product by Tierion researcher Paul Sztorc (previously Bloq) — was released in September. The drivechain sidechain model is not federated but is entirely secured by Bitcoin miners. Leveraging their existing hash power (and combined with technical safeguards to limit risks), miners both act as gatekeepers of the sidechain and confirm transactions on it.

More of a concept than a specific sidechain design, Sztorc hopes that Bitcoin’s future holds a diverse range of drivechains in order to copy many of the features now deployed on altcoins. A potential first drivechain would be a “big block” sidechain for fast and cheap transactions, while Sztorc’s personal interest has always been to deploy a prediction market sidechain.

Development-wise, the drivechain project made steady progress this year, Sztorc said.

“We are on release 12, and 13 is almost finished and has many improvements. Many bugs are being fixed. We are working on making the software perfect for now.”

However, drivechains do require a soft-fork upgrade to Bitcoin’s base protocol in order to be compatible. Such an upgrade was discussed on the Bitcoin development mailing list about a year ago, and an official Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP301) was submitted by Sztorc in early 2018.

Sztorc, however, is doubtful that such a soft fork will be deployed by Bitcoin Core, historically the Bitcoin software application through which most soft forks have been activated.

""I'm pessimistic that I can persuade Core maintainers to merge it in,” he said, “and I am doubtful even that miners would activate it if it were merged, as miner-activated soft forks haven’t happened in a few years, and not at all since SegWit — it used to happen every few months.""

While Sztorc would still prefer that the drivechain BIP be implemented by Bitcoin Core, he is keeping all options open for now. This includes soft-fork activation without help from Bitcoin Core or deployment of drivechains on Bitcoin Cash instead.

Ultimately, Sztorc may even launch a whole new forkcoin with drivechain functionality enabled.

“It would then have the same general feel as a Monero or Bitcoin Cash,” he said. “Some different project.”

Schnorr Signature Proposal
The Schnorr signature scheme is considered by many cryptographers to be the best in the field. Its mathematical properties offer a strong level of correctness, it doesn’t suffer from malleability, it is relatively fast to verify and, in the context of Bitcoin, it would enable nifty new features. Schnorr signatures have, therefore, been high on the wishlist of many within Bitcoin’s technical community for some time now.

While Segregated Witness made Schnorr integration in Bitcoin easier, it’s still a major undertaking — at the start of 2018, this was not realistically expected to be completed by the end of this year.

But good progress has been made.

In July, Blockstream and Bitcoin Core developer Pieter Wuille proposed an initial BIP on the Bitcoin Development mailing list, with input from other Bitcoin Core contributors including Johnson Lau, Gregory Maxwell, Jonas Nick, Andrew Poelstra, Tim Ruffing, Rusty Russell and Anthony Towns.

But the Schnorr signature proposal itself was only the start, Wuille told Bitcoin Magazine. There will be several more BIPs to come as part of the “Schnorr project.”

“The Schnorr BIP defines the signature algorithm itself,” Wuille explained. “There will be another BIP for integrating it into Bitcoin. The next step is to work out all of the details; more BIPs aren’t far off.”

Bitcoin Core developer for Xapo and contributor to Wuille’s Schnorr proposal Anthony Towns sent an email to the Bitcoin-development mailing list last week, detailing several of the additional changes that will be required to realize Schnorr on Bitcoin. These include new sighash flags, discussion of which had been ongoing on the same mailing list since November.

Of particular interest is that Wuille and the other Bitcoin Core contributors are now working on a proposal to implement Schnorr in combination with another big technical upgrade: Taproot.

Taproot was first proposed in January of this year by Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell (who also contributed to Wuille's Schnorr proposal). Leveraging several Schnorr-based tricks, Taproot can realize a solution much like MAST: it would let users create a sort of data-efficient smart contract. But interestingly, under normal circumstances, these smart contracts would be indistinguishable from regular payments.

Practically speaking, Taproot would, for example, allow users to open and close Lightning Network channels, or make payments that require cooperation between multiple users, or make certain types of protocol-enforced bets without anyone besides the parties involved being able to notice that is what’s happening — a boon for privacy.

Still, the initial Schnorr implementation will probably be straightforward relative to what the signature algorithm could ultimately enable, Wuille said. Many of these more complex features will only be added later.

“Signatures interact with many other parts of the protocol that need to be worked out, so it seems more reasonable to first integrate Schnorr and Taproot. That will offer a number of benefits already, like verifying most spends with a single signature, and without needing to disclose a script,” Wuille explained. “Once we’ve implemented Schnorr in Bitcoin there is a good number of things wallets can do, including multisignatures and threshold signatures. The nice thing is that these features don’t require their own consensus rules.”

2019/1/3,Neutrino: A Privacy-Preserving Light Wallet Protocol,"Lightning is all the rage these days and, while it's an exciting development, users currently have to have a full node running in order to transact in it. In this article, I'm going to introduce Neutrino, a new protocol for light clients to get the data that they need while preserving privacy and without trusting a central server.

A Little History
In the original white paper written in 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto described something called Simplified Payment Verification (SPV). SPV is how a light node can verify payments without downloading, verifying or storing the entire blockchain. This was supposed to be the basis of light wallets. Unfortunately, the original Bitcoin Core software did not implement Simplified Payment Verification, so light clients did not have access to the data necessary to do SPV in a privacy-preserving way.

In 2013, BIP0037 was added to Bitcoin Core to make SPV viable. BIP0037 created network commands to make the Simplified Payment Verification possible for light nodes to do. Light nodes could now ask for proof that a particular transaction happened in a particular block. That way, light nodes wouldn't have to trust servers but could actually verify the data being given to them.

To achieve this, the light client gives the server a filter. The server then runs the filter over all the transactions of a new block and reports back those transactions, along with proof that they're in the block, to the client. The client then verifies the proof and looks at the transactions to see if any of them belong to the wallet.

Unfortunately, BIP0037 has a few drawbacks. Among others, it was seen as being difficult to implement and most light wallets have opted to use something else. The Electrum wallet, for example, uses its own proprietary protocol which isn't privacy-preserving. The Mycelium wallet calls servers that the Mycelium company runs. In addition, there are denial-of-service vectors (by having to run lots of filters) to exploit servers that respond to BIP0037 requests.

Furthermore, the privacy aspects of BIP0037 turned out to not be as strong as was thought. It turns out the server can know a lot about the light wallet (like what balance it might have, whom its transacting with, possibly even what it's buying) by looking for certain kinds of patterns.

As a result, BIP0037 has largely fallen into disuse, despite being in the Core software since 2013.

What Is Neutrino?
Neutrino is a protocol to verify payments, except this time, the bulk of the work is done on the client side. Instead of the server filtering transactions for the client, now all the transactions belonging to a block (technically ScriptPubKeys corresponding to each input and output except the OP_RETURN outputs) are compressed and sent to the client. It's now the client's job to figure out if any of the transactions are ones it has transacted in. If any of the transactions are relevant to the wallet, the client then requests the full block to verify the transactions.

It turns out that the compression can be pretty impressive. A normal block is around 1.4MB, but by compressing it (technically, hashing each ScriptPubKey to 64 bits), each block produces about 20KB of super-compressed data per block. Since this super-compressed block is the same for every light client, this removes the denial-of-service vulnerability for the server. This also means that the server gets no special information about the light client other than what blocks it wants to look at, meaning that there are much fewer privacy leaks.

Trade-offs
Of course, by adding privacy, we do have some trade-offs to consider. First, there's more data being sent back and forth. While 1.4MB to 20KB is a pretty large reduction in bandwidth, BIP0037 allowed an even bigger reduction as servers only transmitted about 3KB of data for blocks where there were transactions the wallet participated in and only 80 bytes for blocks without such transactions. Assuming about one transaction per day, that's about 100 bytes per block overall for BIP0037, which means Neutrino is more expensive from a bandwidth standpoint.

Further, there is more validation to do on the client side as the client now has to do additional verification to prove that the data sent by the server is true.

Privacy is preserved while looking for transactions that the wallet has participated in. Usually, these are transactions where the wallet is receiving money. For sending money, however, Neutrino doesn't really help and there are a lot of privacy concerns there still (though Tor and Dandelion can help).

Lastly, there is likely going to have to be a new commitment to the coinbase transaction of each block to facilitate Neutrino, which would require a soft fork.

What This Means for You
It turns out that Neutrino is not just useful for Bitcoin wallets, it's also useful for Lightning. Setting up a Lightning node is currently difficult, in part because you have to run a full node which takes a long time to sync. Neutrino is available in btcd, but not in Bitcoin Core yet, so until it’s available in Bitcoin Core, light wallets are going to have a tough time finding nodes to get data from. It is for this reason that Wasabi has had to make their own servers with similar super-compressed block data.

Once Neutrino arrives to Bitcoin Core, Lightning Wallets will be able to run as a light client much more easily. And that means that your bitcoin wallet will be far more effective in preserving privacy. This does not mean that you’ll have complete anonymity, especially from chain analysis, but you will be able to achieve a large portion of the privacy that full nodes currently enjoy without storing, transmitting or verifying the entire blockchain.

Privacy leaks are ultimately security leaks as information about you can be used against you.

Transacting with wallets which use the Neutrino protocol means that your bitcoin transactions, whether on-chain or on the Lightning Network, will be a little less susceptible to leaking information.

More Information
For developers interested in this technology, BIP0157 and BIP0158 spell out the protocol in detail and test vectors are available from the developers at Lightning Labs. For consumers, ask if your wallet provider is planning on implementing Neutrino.

Conclusion
Neutrino is a technology that is long overdue. Most people using light node software have to trust external parties to some degree, which is not the cypherpunk ideal. By using Neutrino, wallet developers will now be able to create wallets that are truly self-contained and do not require trusting a server.",Technical,-0.9905
2019/1/24,"Taproot Is Coming: What It Is, and How It Will Benefit Bitcoin","Bitcoin users may, before long, be able to benefit from a trick called “Taproot.” First proposed by Bitcoin Core contributor and former Blockstream CTO Gregory Maxwell, Taproot would expand on Bitcoin’s smart contract flexibility, while offering more privacy in doing so. Even the most complex smart contracts would, on the blockchain, typically be indistinguishable from regular transactions.

While a big undertaking, this is not just theory. Several of the most prolific Bitcoin Core contributors — including Pieter Wuille, Anthony Towns, Johnson Lau, Jonas Nick, Andrew Poelstra, Tim Ruffing, Rusty Russell and, indeed, Gregory Maxwell — are working on a Schnorr signature proposal that would include Taproot, all in one protocol upgrade.

Here’s what Taproot is and how it works.

P2SH

All bitcoins are essentially “locked up” in scripts: a couple lines of code embedded in a transaction included in the blockchain, that define how the coins can be spent in the next transaction. Spending conditions usually involve providing a signature to prove ownership of the coins. But other, well-known conditions for example include timelocks (coins can only be spent after a specific block height or date) or multisig (coins can only be spent if some number of private keys out of a set of private keys provide signatures).

Different conditions can be mixed and matched, to create complex types of smart contracts. An example of such a contract could be that coins can be spent if both Alice and Bob sign, or if Alice alone signs after a week has passed, or if Bob alone signs while also providing a secret number. Whichever of these three conditions is met first, is how the coins are spent.

Since 2012, scripts (the conditions) are often not publicly visible at first; only the new owner of the coins knows how they can be spent. This is done with a trick called P2SH (pay to script hash), where initially only a hash of the script is included in the blockchain. This seemingly randomly scrambled number holds the coins. When the owner spends the coins, he reveals the whole script as well as the “solution” to the script at the same time. Anyone can then use the initial hash to check that the supplied script was indeed the original script locking up the coins and can immediately conclude that the requirements of the script were met.

Still, when the coins are spent, it’s currently necessary to reveal all the possible conditions that could have been met — including the conditions that weren’t met. This has two main downsides. One, it’s data heavy, especially if there are many conditions. And two, it’s bad for privacy. Everyone learns all the different ways in which funds could have been spent, which can, for example, reveal what kind of wallet was used and perhaps even more.

MAST

MAST (Merkelized Abstract Syntax Tree) is a proposed solution that uses Merkle trees (a decades-old, compact data structure invented by cryptographer Ralph Merkle) to work around these two downsides. In short, all the different conditions under which the funds can be spent are individually hashed (as opposed to combined into a single hash) and included in a Merkle tree, which ultimately produces a single hash: the Merkle root. This Merkle root “locks up” the coins.

The unique benefit is that if any of the data in the Merkle tree is revealed, the Merkle root and some additional data (called the Merkle path) can be used to verify that that specific data was included in the Merkle tree. The rest of the Merkle tree remains hashed and hidden.

With MAST, this means that only the condition that is met needs to be revealed. If, in the initial example above, Alice alone spends the funds after a week, she just reveals that condition (and the Merkle path). No one learns that the money could have also been spent by Alice and Bob together, or by Bob alone if he’d added a secret number. This makes MAST more data efficient than complex P2SH smart contracts and adds privacy to boot.

Yet with Schnorr, Taproot can do even better: a transaction can hide that a MAST-structure existed at all.

Schnorr

The Schnorr signature scheme has long been on the wishlist of many Bitcoin developers and is currently in development to be deployed as a soft fork protocol upgrade. Many cryptographers consider the Schnorr signature scheme to be the best in the field, as its mathematical properties offer a strong level of correctness, it doesn’t suffer from malleability and is relatively fast to verify.

As its best-known benefit in the context of Bitcoin, Schnorr’s “linear math” allows for signature aggregation: several signatures in the same transaction can be combined into one. A similar trick could be applied to multisig transactions. Combining both public keys and signatures into “threshold public keys” and “threshold signatures,” a multisig transaction can be made indistinguishable from any regular transaction.

And the signature scheme can be used in even more interesting ways. For example, it’s possible to use data to “tweak” both a private key and a public key. As a simplified example, a private key and its corresponding public key could be tweaked by multiplying both by two. The “private key x 2” and the “public key x 2” would still correspond, and the “private key x 2” could still sign messages that could be verified with the “public key x 2.” Anyone unaware that the original key pair was tweaked wouldn’t even see any difference; the tweaked keys look like any other key pair.

This is what enables Taproot.

Taproot

Taproot is based on an interesting realization: no matter how complex, almost any MAST-construction could (or should) include a condition that allows all participants to agree on the outcome and simply sign off on a settlement transaction together. In the earlier example, if Bob knows Alice can, by herself, claim all the funds next week, he might as well cooperate with her now to sign off together. (In many typical smart contract setups he would even be penalized if he doesn’t. The complexity really just serves to keep everyone honest.)

Taproot resembles MAST and always includes a condition where all participants can cooperate to spend the funds: the “cooperative close.”

By utilizing Schnorr signatures, this is where it gets interesting.

First off, the cooperative close would utilize Schnorr’s threshold trick to make it look like a regular transaction, from one person to another. So, the public keys of all participants are added together, resulting in the “threshold public key.” Corresponding with this threshold public key, the combination of all participants’ signatures — their “threshold signature” — allows them to spend the funds.

So far so good, but spending the funds as if it were a normal transaction is the only thing they can do — no MAST-like structures yet. That’s where the other Schnorr trick comes in.

All the alternative ways in which the funds can be spent — the non-cooperative outcomes — are this time combined into a different script. This script, then, is hashed and used to tweak the threshold public key. Rather than “public key x 2,” as used in the example earlier, this results in a “threshold public key x script.” (We’re still simplifying.) This “threshold public key x script” corresponds, of course, to a “threshold signature x script.”

Now, if the money is spent cooperatively, all participants combine their signatures into the “threshold signature” and tweak it with the script. The resulting “threshold signature x script” allows them to spend the funds. Yet, and importantly, to the outside world, all this would still just look like a regular public key and a regular signature — a regular transaction.

Only if a cooperative close proves impossible, the threshold public key can be shown for what it really is: tweaked.

In this case, both the original threshold public key and the script are revealed. This proves that the “threshold public key x script” was tweaked with this specific script. So, like the hash in P2SH, the tweak proves to the world that the funds should be spendable if the alternative conditions, as specified in this script, are met. (And, like with P2SH, these conditions are of course immediately met to spend the funds.)

Alternatively, instead of tweaking the threshold public key with script, the threshold public key can be tweaked with a Merkle root of a Merkle tree that includes all the different conditions under which the funds can be spent: a MAST structure. To spend the funds, then, only the spending condition that’s been met needs to be revealed.

As such, Taproot offers all the benefits of MAST, while under normal circumstances no one will ever know that a regular transaction was hiding such a complex smart contract as a fallback.

This is a general outline of the Taproot concept; implementation specifics may vary. For more details, read the original Taproot proposal by Gregory Maxwell or watch this presentation by Pieter Wuille.",Technical,0.4588
2019/1/25,Graftroot: How Delegating Signatures Allows for Near-Infinite Spending Variations,"This article is a direct follow-up from our Taproot explainer. If you haven’t read that article, you should probably do so first.

If Taproot is deployed on Bitcoin, many smart contract constructions will look just like regular transactions on the blockchain. As long as all participants agree on the outcome of the contract — a “cooperative close” — the clever combination of Schnorr and MAST offers both data efficiency and privacy.

However, if a Taproot smart contract is complex enough — that is, if there are many potential outcomes — the Merkle path that needs to be revealed in case of an uncooperative close would still be data heavy.

A follow-up proposal by Bitcoin Core contributor Gregory Maxwell, “Graftroot,” could provide similar benefits as Taproot but without this downside, offering even more smart contract flexibility.

Graftroot
With Taproot, all participants in a smart contract combine their public keys to create a “threshold public key,” from which they can spend with their “threshold signature.” For Graftroot, all participants create such a threshold public key as well. But this time, they do not tweak this threshold public key.

The participants do create the different scripts: the alternative conditions under which the money can be spent. But, with Graftroot, they all sign the different scripts to create threshold signatures corresponding with these scripts. Any participant that wishes to use a particular script as a fallback takes and stores that script and the corresponding threshold signature. These signatures can later prove to the world that the script was a valid alternative, a ""delegation"", agreed upon by all participants.

So, let’s say that Alice and Bob establish a smart contract where both of them can spend funds together, or have Alice alone spend it after a week, or have Bob alone spend it in combination with a secret number. In this case, Alice and Bob combine their public keys to create a threshold public key from which they can later spend the funds if they provide the threshold signature. (They do not create this threshold signature yet — only when they spend the funds.)

Then, they also create and immediately sign the alternative scripts. Alice keeps the threshold signature corresponding to the script that lets her spend the coins after a week, and Bob keeps the threshold signature corresponding to the script that lets him spend the coins in combination with a secret number. (Note that the threshold signatures and corresponding scripts alone don’t suffice to spend the coins; they just prove that the scripts are agreed on by both Alice and Bob. The conditions specified in the scripts still need to be met to spend the coins.)

The next day, when the time comes to settle the contract, Alice and Bob will likely agree to sign the settlement transaction. They, together, create a threshold signature to spend from the threshold public key, and no one else learns about the alternative spending conditions, or even that more than one person was involved. It looks like a regular transaction.

But, if the cooperative close fails for some reason, whoever can meet an alternative condition gets to spend the coins alone. If Bob has the secret number, he reveals “his” alternative script in combination with the threshold signature corresponding to the script. The rest of the world can check the threshold signature against the threshold public key, and will conclude that all participants in the smart contract agreed on the alternative script. Bob can, therefore, rightfully spend the coins with the secret number. Alternatively, if a week has passed, Alice can reveal “her” alternative script in combination with the threshold signature for the script and spend the coins. In either case, no one learns of the alternative backup script.

The main benefit of Graftroot is that it no longer matters how complex a smart contract is or, more accurately, how many possible outcomes there are. While the above example only includes two alternative scripts, a Graftroot construction could include hundreds, and it wouldn’t make a difference. Alice and Bob could even add more conditions after the original smart contract was constructed!

A downside, however, is that Graftroot is interactive. Participants must communicate with each other to sign the alternative scripts, even before spending the coins. Additionally, participants will need to store the threshold signatures for the alternative scripts; if they lose this signature, they lose their fallback.

Graftroot’s Development
So, when will Bitcoin users be able to utilize this tech?

The good news is that with Segregated Witness, a feature called “Script Versioning” allows for a relatively easy rollout of these types of changes — Schnorr signatures, Taproot, Graftroot — in a backwards-compatible manner.

Still, ideally, the Bitcoin Core contributors working on these kinds of upgrades — this includes Pieter Wuille, Anthony Towns, Johnson Lau, Jonas Nick, Andrew Poelstra, Tim Ruffing, Rusty Russell and Gregory Maxwell — would prefer to roll out all these improvements at once. While script versioning makes upgrading easy, it does require that transactions reveal which protocol upgrade is being used. So while Graftroot could perfectly hide that alternative scripts were available, the script version could still reveal that the transaction is using Graftroot. Deploying multiple protocol upgrades at once avoids this to an extent, as they'd all use the same script version. On top of that, deploying several upgrades at once benefits software compatibility.

On the other hand, a “relatively easy rollout” is still a huge undertaking when it comes to consensus changes on a security-critical protocol that is running 24/7, sometimes with varying interests and preferences when it comes to upgrades. Each potential feature has its own trade-offs, so combining many at once could also lead to more objections. And, of course, combining more features into a single upgrade doesn’t make the development process any easier either.

For now, therefore, Schnorr signatures and Taproot are prioritized, to be proposed as a single package. Graftroot could be a step after that.

This is a general outline of the Graftroot concept; implementation specifics may vary. For more details, read the original Graftroot proposal by Gregory Maxwell or watch this presentation by Pieter Wuille.",Technical,0.9984
2018/5/2,A Quantum Blockchain “Time Machine” Could Keep Future Blockchains Secure,"Two researchers from Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand have proposed a new quantum blockchain technology that, by exploiting quantum entanglement across time, could greatly increase the security of future blockchain systems operating on quantum networks.

Senior author Matt Visser is a renowned mathematician and cosmologist who has authored books with titles like “Artificial Black Holes” and “Lorentzian Wormholes.” The lead author, Del Rajan, is a Ph.D. student in Visser’s group.

""Previous blockchains that worked with quantum operations were presented, but the blockchain itself was never quantum,"" said Rajan, as reported by IEEE Spectrum. ""We are presenting the first fully quantum blockchain.""

""It's expected that 10 percent of global GDP could be stored on blockchain technology by 2027,"" added Rajan. Therefore, it’s critically important to find ways to increase the security of blockchain networks. Visser and Rajan are persuaded that their quantum blockchain concept could permit watertight tamper-proofing of all records and transactions.

The two scientists propose using “[quantum] entanglement in time between photons that do not simultaneously coexist.”

Quantum entanglement, the “spooky action at a distance” that baffled Einstein, indicates correlations between remote quantum particles that share a common origin or have interacted in the past. Entangled non-local correlation seems instantaneous, or at least it propagates much faster than other physical interactions. In particular, entanglement between particles too remote to exchange signals limited by the speed of light has been repeatedly confirmed in research labs.

It turns out that probing the state of one particle in an entangled pair affects the state of the other particle in subtle ways. While, according to current scientific consensus, entangled correlations can’t be used to send faster-than-light signals, important practical applications of entanglement include quantum computing and quantum cryptography.

For cryptography, entanglement is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, future quantum computers based on entangled qubits — physical quantum bits that can be in a quantum superposition of classical zero and one states — promise to break today’s strongest cryptography. Quantum information technology is actively pursued by entities with large budgets, like governments, including the U.S. and China, and tech giants, including IBM, Intel and Microsoft.

A report recently issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) notes that practical quantum computers, which could be developed in the near future, would be capable of greatly weakening (and, in some cases, rendering useless) existing cryptographic algorithms.

This could result in the need to change, or update, the cryptographic technology used in today’s blockchain systems. The report provides a table, taken from NIST’s 2016 “Report on Post-Quantum Cryptography,” describing the impact of quantum computing on common cryptographic algorithms. In summary, RSA, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECDSA and ECDH) and Finite Field Cryptography (DSA) should be considered as no longer secure. AES, SHA-2 and SHA-3 should use larger key and output sizes.

On the other hand, while entanglement enables powerful quantum computers that might soon break today’s best cryptography, it also enables quantum cryptography with unbreakable security, guaranteed by fundamental quantum physics itself. Quantum key distribution exploits entangled correlations to detect attempts by eavesdroppers to intercept cryptographic keys.

If entanglement sounds weird, entanglement in time sounds even weirder. It turns out that nonlocal entangled correlations extend not only across space but also across time.

“[Measuring] the last photon affects the physical description of the first photon in the past, before it has even been measured,” noted the physicists who first demonstrated the concept in the lab. “Thus, the ‘spooky action’ is steering the system’s past.”

Visser and Rajan’s basic idea is to encode data on a quantum particle, explains MIT Technology Review. “This becomes the first quantum block. When more data is available, this is combined with the data from the first particle in a quantum operation that entangles it with a second particle. The former is then discarded, and the record of the first block of transactions is combined with the second block. The data from a third block can be added in the same way, creating a chain.”

Visser and Rajan note: “[In] our quantum blockchain, we can interpret our encoding procedure as linking the current records in a block, not to a record of the past, but [to] the actual record in the past, which does not exist anymore. The attacker cannot even attempt to access the previous photons since they no longer exist.” Therefore, entanglement in time provides a far greater security benefit than entanglement in space.

""Records about past transactions are encoded onto a quantum state that is spread across time,"" summarizes Rajan.

""This work can be viewed as a quantum time machine,"" adds Visser.

This may sound like science fiction, but it’s backed by solid science and existing technology implementations. “[All] the subsystems of this design have already been shown to be experimentally realized,” note the researchers. Practical applications to creating highly secure transaction networks are likely to attract the interest of governments and corporations.

The quantum blockchain couldn’t be implemented on top of today’s commercial communication networks, which are not designed to handle quantum information. However, Visser and Rajan emphasize that significant progress is currently being made toward the creation of a global quantum network.

“We have reached the point where the question is no longer whether we are going to have a global quantum network, but rather when and how it will be implemented,” claims a recent review published in Nature Photonics.

Among the powerful state actors, China is developing quantum key distribution satellites and a fiber link stretching over 2,000 km from Beijing to Shanghai. In the private sector, South Korean telecom giant SK Telecom is investing $65 million to develop quantum technologies for the telecom and Internet of Things (IoT) markets in partnership with Swiss quantum information company ID Quantique.

In view of the surging interest in quantum information technologies and the theoretical work of Visser and Rajan, it seems plausible that highly secure quantum blockchains could be implemented on future quantum networks.",Technical,0.34
2016/2/18,Bitcoin Core Developer Eric Lombrozo on Misunderstandings in Block Size Debate,"Bitcoin Core contributor and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo was recently interviewed on Epicenter Bitcoin, and he used a portion of his time to explain some misconceptions and misunderstandings related to the block size limit debate. 

While the focus of this development controversy has mainly centered on the actual block size metric in the Bitcoin protocol, Lombrozo says this misses the main point of disagreement. In his view, a hard fork is what the Bitcoin Core development community would like to avoid over the short term.

The Hard Fork Is the Issue

When explaining the full picture of the block size debate, Lombrozo made the point that the non-technical Bitcoin community (likely a reference to Bitcoin subreddits) may not have had the full picture of what was going on in the development community back in May of 2015. Lombrozo described the debate that took place among developers during this period of time:

“I think that a lot of the non-technical community and the public were not really witnessing exactly the whole development as far as what the developers were doing. Way back in May, we were already talking about considering these ideas when it was first proposed to the mailing list, and people were actually really trying to pick this apart and figure out all the things that could possibly go wrong. It quickly became apparent that hard forks have very significant stability issues, they can potentially open up attack vectors, and it could be very dangerous for the network.”

Although progress has been made on the simplicity of soft fork deployments, hard forks are still hard. At the recent Blockchain Agenda Conference in San Diego, Lombrozo detailed BIP 9, which allows for several new features to be applied to Bitcoin via simultaneous soft forks.

Contentious Hard Forks Should Be Avoided

Getting deeper into the problems with hard forks, Lombrozo made it clear that such changes to Bitcoin’s consensus rules are not impossible. Instead, he said contentious hard forks are the ones that should be avoided. Lombrozo noted:

“I am very concerned about hard forks. That’s not to say it’s impossible to do a hard fork more safely, [but] I think the only way that’s viable is if there isn’t this kind of contentiousness – if you don’t have a lot of polarization and people kind of fighting over different things. If most of the network agrees on something – if something is pretty much uncontroversial – that’s fine.”

 

Bitcoin Classic is a new implementation of the Bitcoin protocol with an increased block size limit of 2 megabytes. This change in the block size limit would require a hard fork, and it is enabled 28 days after 750 of the last 1,000 blocks have been found by miners who support the increase. 

Many Bitcoin Core contributors find this hard fork to be contentious and would like to see something in the 90 to 95 percent social consensus range. Although an intentional hard fork has never been attempted on the Bitcoin network (Note: One change implemented in 2010 and activated in 2012 had implications somewhat similar to a hard fork), 95 percent approval from miners has been the standard for past soft forks.

We All Want Bigger Blocks

Lombrozo said everyone would like to see the Bitcoin network scale via an increased block size limit. He explained:

“As far as the block size itself, I don’t think there was much issue with bigger blocks. I don’t think many of the Core developers actually said, ‘No, we should never have bigger blocks.’ I think, for the most part, the idea of having bigger blocks is something that is appealing. We should find a way to have bigger blocks; we all want bigger blocks. But just increasing the blocks by changing a constant in the code presents a lot of very, very serious problems.”

In other words, Bitcoin Core contributors would like to see a solution to the block size limit issue that does not involve a contentious hard fork.

Segregated Witness Is the Best of Both Worlds

Until recently, the concept of increasing the block size limit while also avoiding a hard fork was theoretical. Bitcoin Core Developer Pieter Wuille presented Segregated Witness (SegWit) at the Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong Workshop to near-universal acclaim. Lombrozo described how this solution provides developers with the best path forward:

“It turns out, if we want to do this and do it safely, we probably have to retrofit some stuff and do a lot more risk mitigation, which is what we’re trying to do with this. With SegWit, we kind of get the best of both worlds. I mean yes, it’s not a single, constant change in the code – it does require a bit of modification to applications – but it’s not a very significant modification. And it’s much safer from all of the other aspects of it. It really does not cause all of the stability issues that just changing this constant does.”

 

Some detractors of the SegWit soft fork have noted the changes to Bitcoin wallets required by this proposal are too cumbersome, but Lombrozo said that the wallet developers he’s worked with have been able to implement the required changes in a few days. The Bitcoin Core website also lists the wallet providers who plan to support SegWit.

The Soft Fork Is Almost Like a No-Brainer

In Lombrozo’s view (and Bitcoin Core’s view according to their roadmap), the Segregated Witness soft fork is nearly a no-brainer. The Ciphrex CEO explained:

“Block size was never really the issue; that was never really what people were arguing about. It was much more about this hard fork thing – whether we should do a hard fork or not. Now that we have a soft fork way to do it, it’s almost like a no-brainer.”

Lombrozo went on to say that there is general consensus among the Bitcoin Core development community that the network cannot handle blocks much bigger than 2 megabytes right now. This means a hard fork to anything over 2 megabytes would likely not gain social consensus among Bitcoin Core contributors. Segregated Witness also comes with a variety of benefits unrelated to the block size limit, which Lombrozo has discussed in the past.",Technical,-0.8107
2018/4/24,The Genesis Files: How David Chaum’s eCash Spawned a Cypherpunk Dream,"“You can pay for access to a database, buy software or a newsletter by email, play a computer game over the net, receive $5 owed you by a friend, or just order a pizza. The possibilities are truly unlimited.”

This quote is not from a 2011 Bitcoin introduction video. In fact, the quote is not about Bitcoin at all. It is not even from this millennium. The quote is from cryptographer Dr. David Chaum, speaking at the first ever CERN conference in Geneva in 1994. What he’s talking about is eCash.

If the cypherpunk movement has a forefather, the bearded, ponytailed Chaum is it. To say that the cryptographer — now 62 or 63 years old (he won’t reveal his exact age) — was ahead of the curve is an understatement. Before most people had heard of the internet, before most homes had personal computers, before Edward Snowden, Jacob Appelbaum or Pavel Durov were even born, Chaum concerned himself with the future of online privacy.

“You have to let your readers know how important this is,” Chaum once told a Wired journalist. “Cyberspace doesn't have all the physical constraints. […] There are no walls … it's a different, scary, weird place, and with identification it's a panopticon nightmare. Right? Everything you do could be known to anyone else, could be recorded forever. It's antithetical to the basic principle underlying the mechanisms of democracy.”

Chaum, who started his career as a computer science professor at Berkeley University, was not just a digital privacy advocate. He designed the tools to realize it. First published in 1981, Chaum’s paper “Untraceable Electronic Mail, Return Addresses, and Digital Pseudonyms” laid the groundwork for research into encrypted communication over the internet, which would eventually lead to privacy-preserving technologies like Tor.

But privacy of regular communication was not at the top of Chaum’s priority list. He arguably had an even bigger idea. The Berkeley professor wanted to design a privacy-preserving digital money.

“The choice between keeping information in the hands of individuals or of organizations is being made each time any government or business decides to automate another set of transactions,” Chaum would explain in the Scientific American in 1992. “The shape of society in the next century may depend on which approach predominates.”

Ten years prior, by 1982, Chaum had already solved the puzzle, which he had published in his second major paper: “Blind signatures for untraceable payments.” At a point in time when today’s Bitcoin veterans like Dr. Pieter Wuille, Erik Voorhees or Peter Todd had yet to take their first breath, the cryptographer had designed a solution to realize an anonymous payment system for the internet.

Blind Signatures
At the heart of Chaum’s digital money system lies his innovation of “blind signatures.”

To understand blind signatures, it’s important to first remember how public key cryptography works and, in particular, what (regular) cryptographic signatures are.

Public key cryptography uses key pairs. Such a pair consists of a public key, which is a seemingly random string of numbers that is mathematically derived from the other, truly random string of numbers: the private key. With the private key, it’s trivial to generate the public key. But with only the public key, it’s practically impossible to generate the private key: it’s a one way street.

Public key cryptography can be used to establish private communication between two people — in academic circles usually referred to as “Alice” and “Bob” — who only share their public keys with one another. Their private keys remain private.

But private communication is not all Alice and Bob can do. Alice can also cryptographically “sign” any piece of data (and so can Bob). To do so, Alice must mathematically combine her private key with this data. The result will be another seemingly random string of numbers known as the “signature.” Once again, it’s impossible to recreate Alice's private key from the signature (with or without the piece of data). It’s all still a one-way street.

The interesting thing about this signature is that Bob (or anyone else) can check it against Alice’s public key. This tells Bob that it was indeed Alice that created the signature with her private key (and the added piece of data). This can, in turn, mean whatever Alice and Bob want. For example, it can mean that Alice agrees with the content of the data (just like a handwritten signature).

A blind signature then takes all this one step further. This time, Bob first generates a random number, called a “nonce,” and mathematically combines this with the piece of data. This “scrambles” the piece of data to make it seem like yet another random string of numbers. Bob can then give the scrambled data to Alice for her to sign. Alice cannot tell what the original data looks like, so she is “blind signing” it. The result is a “blind signature.”

Now, the interesting thing about this blind signature is that it’s not just linked to Alice’s keys (like any signature would be) and the scrambled data. The same blind signature is also linked to the original, unscrambled data. Using only Alice’s public key, anyone can check that Alice signed a scrambled version of the original data — including, of course, Alice herself, if she does get to see the original data later on.

eCash
This blind signature scheme is the trick that Chaum used to create a digital money system.

To realize this, Alice from the above example would actually be a bank: Alice Bank. This is a regular bank, like banks exist today, where customers have bank accounts with (in this example) U.S. dollar deposits.

Let’s say Alice Bank has four customers: Bob, Carol, Dan and Erin. And let’s say that Bob wants to buy something from Carol.

First, Bob requests a “withdrawal” from Alice Bank. (Ideally, he had already made this withdrawal earlier — but never mind that for now.) To make this withdrawal, Bob actually creates “digital banknotes” himself, in the form of unique numbers: “serial numbers.” On top of that, he scrambles these banknotes, as shown above. These scrambled banknotes are sent to Alice Bank.

Having received the scrambled banknotes from Bob, Alice Bank then blind signs each scrambled banknote and sends them back to Bob. For each signed, scrambled banknote that she sends back, Alice Bank subtracts one dollar from Bob’s bank account.

Now, because Alice Bank blind signed the scrambled banknotes, her signature is also linked to the original, unscrambled banknotes. So, Bob can now use the original, unscrambled banknotes to pay Carol by simply sending them to her.

As Carol receives the banknotes, she should forward them to Alice Bank. Alice Bank then checks that she indeed blind signed each of the banknotes, which her blind signatures allow her to do: they are linked to her own keys. Alice Bank also checks that the same banknotes (serial numbers) haven’t already been deposited by someone else in order to ensure that they haven’t been double-spent.

As the banknotes check out, Alice Bank adds the equivalent number of dollars to Carol’s bank balance, and lets Carol know. Upon this confirmation, Carol knows she’s been paid valid banknotes by Bob and can safely send him whatever he was buying from her.

Of key importance, Alice Bank will see the unscrambled banknotes for the first time only when Carol deposits them! As such, Alice Bank has no way of knowing that the banknotes were Bob’s. They could just as well have come from Dan or Erin.

As such, Chaum’s solution offers privacy in payments. This was not new in itself, of course: private payments were the norm in those days. But it was new in digital form. Hence, Chaum’s analogy: cash. Electronic cash. eCash.

DigiCash
By 1990, a little under 10 years after finishing his first papers (younger cryptocurrency developers like Matt Corallo, Vitalik Buterin and Olaoluwa Osuntokun still hadn’t been born), David Chaum founded DigiCash. The company was based in Amsterdam, where Chaum had been living for a couple of years, and specialized in — indeed — digital money and payment systems. These included a government project to replace toll booths (which was eventually cancelled) and smart cards (akin to what we call hardware wallets today). But DigiCash’s flagship project was its digital cash system, eCash. (The system was called eCash, while the money in the system was dubbed “CyberBucks,” comparable to using capital-letter Bitcoin for the protocol and lower case bitcoin for the currency.)

At a time that Netscape and Yahoo! were leading the tech industry to new heights, and where some thought micropayments, not advertisements, would be the revenue model for the web, DigiCash was considered a rising star by tech entrepreneurs of the day. Of course, Chaum and his team had much faith in their technology as well.

“As payments on the network mature, you’re going to be paying for all kinds of small things, more payments than one makes today,” Chaum told the New York Times in 1994, of course, emphasizing the importance of privacy in such a world. “Every article you read, every question you have, you’re going to have to pay for it.”

That year, after four years of development, the first successful payments were tested, and later that same year eCash trials began: Banks could acquire a license from DigiCash to use the technology.

Interest was significant. By late 1995, eCash was licensed to its first bank: the Mark Twain Bank in St. Louis. Moreover, by early 1996, one of the biggest banks in the entire world got on board: Deutsche Bank. Credit Suisse, a second major player joined later, and several other banks across different countries — including the Australian Advance Bank, Norway’s Norske Bank and Bank Austria — would follow suit.

Yet, what’s perhaps more interesting than the deals DigiCash struck are the deals it did not. Two of the three major Dutch banks — ING and ABN Amro — are said to have made DigiCash partnership deals worth tens of millions of dollars. Similarly, Visa reportedly offered a $40 million investment, while Netscape had interest as well: eCash could have been included in the most popular web browser of that era.

Still, the biggest offer of all probably came from none other than Microsoft. Bill Gates wanted to integrate eCash into Windows 95 and is said to have offered DigiCash some $100 million to do so. Chaum, so the story goes, asked for two dollars for each version of Windows 95 sold. The deal was off.

While a rising star in the minds of technologists of the day, DigiCash seemed to have trouble making a financial deal that would help it to realize its full potential.

By 1996, DigiCash employees had seen one failed deal too many and wanted a change in policy. This change came in the form of a new CEO: Visa veteran Michael Nash. The startup also got a fund injection, while MIT Media Lab founder Nicholas Negroponte was made chairman of the board. (Through its Digital Currency Initiative, the MIT Media Lab employs several Bitcoin Core contributors today.) The DigiCash headquarters were moved from Amsterdam to Silicon Valley. Chaum remained part of DigiCash, but now as CTO.

It wouldn’t make much difference. After several years of trials, eCash wasn’t catching on with the general public. The banks that got on board were experimenting but did not really push the technology; by 1998, Mark Twain Bank had only enrolled 300 merchants and 5,000 users. While a final deal with Citibank came close — it could have given the project a good push — this bank ended up walking out for unrelated reasons.

“It was hard to get enough merchants to accept it, so that you could get enough consumers to use it, or vice versa,” Chaum told Forbes in 1999, after DigiCash had finally filed for bankruptcy. “As the Web grew, the average level of sophistication of users dropped. It was hard to explain the importance of privacy to them.”

The Spawning of a Cypherpunk Dream
DigiCash failed, and eCash failed with it. But even though the technology did not succeed as a business, Chaum’s work would inspire a group of cryptographers, hackers and activists, connected through a mailing list. It was this group — which included DigiCash contributors like Nick Szabo and Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn — that would come to be known as the cypherpunks.

Perhaps a bit more radical than Chaum himself ever was, the cypherpunks kept the dream of an electronic cash alive, proposing alternative digital currency systems throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. In 2008, about 10 years after DigiCash’s demise, Satoshi Nakamoto sent his proposal for an electronic cash to the de-facto successor of the then-defunct cypherpunk mailing list: Bitcoin.

Bitcoin and eCash have little in common from a design perspective. Crucially, eCash was centralized around DigiCash and could not really be its own currency. Even if every single person in the world would only use eCash for all their transactions, banks would still be necessary to offer account balances and confirm transactions. This also means that eCash — while providing privacy — was not as censorship resistant. Where Bitcoin was able to keep WikiLeaks funded even through a banking blockade, for example, eCash could not have done the same thing; banks could still have blocked WikiLeaks’ accounts.

Still, Chaum’s work on digital currency, dating back to the early 1980s, remains relevant. While Bitcoin itself does not employ blind signatures, scaling and privacy layers on top of the Bitcoin protocol could. Bitcointalk forum and r/bitcoin subreddit moderator Theymos, for example, has been a champion of an eCash-like scaling sidechain for Bitcoin for some time. Adam Fiscor, a leader in the domain of Bitcoin transaction privacy today, is realizing coin-mixing services utilizing blind signatures, as once proposed by Bitcoin Core contributor Greg Maxwell. And yet-to-be-announced Lightning Network technology could utilize blind signatures to improve security.

And Chaum himself? He returned to Berkeley, where he is responsible for a long list of publications, many in the field of digital elections and reputation systems. Perhaps, some 20 years from now, an entirely new generation of developers, entrepreneurs and activists will look back at these as the groundwork for a technology that is about to change the world.
