2015/6/5,"Exclusive: Possible $500,000 Bitcoin Cloud Mining Ponzi Scheme Uncovered","Roughly nine months ago, Bitcoin Foundation Chief Scientist Gavin Andresen made a rather interesting comment on Reddit in which he claimed, “I suspect many [cloud mining companies] will turn out to be Ponzi schemes.”There have been a few cloud mining scams uncovered over the past year or two, and it appears that another one could unravel in the near future. An anonymous source has provided information to Bitcoin Magazine regarding the possibility of a Bitcoin cloud mining ponzi scheme involving Bitcoin Cloud Services (BCS), which is currently one of the largest cloud-mining providers on the market. One of the common attributes of a Ponzi scheme in the Bitcoin world is a reliance on anonymous owners. BTC Cloud Services LTD is registered to Gabriel Kleiman and Esteban Amador Soto Martinez.While the first name does not bring up any identifying information online, the second name is associated with another bitcoin-related scam, bitcoincloudhashing.com. This information is available publicly on the bitcointalk forums thanks to Puppet’s Cloudmining 101 thread, but it hasn't stopped an estimated 4,300 users from signing up at Bitcoin Cloud Services. BCS also claims to be a silver member of the Bitcoin Foundation on their website, even though the foundation recently dropped the cloud mining company as a sponsor.

Further, the pictures of a supposed mining facility on the Bitcoin Cloud Services website contain no information about the mining facility or its owners besides a single banner hanging in the background. Compare to the photo below from Genesis Mining showing CEO Marco Streng in one of the company's mining farms. The “company” also released a poorly made video based off the Photoshopped images in an effort to bring more legitimacy to their activities:

The supporting evidence on the blockchain

One of the key pieces of data provided by the anonymous source is a spreadsheet compiled via publicly available data on the Bitcoin blockchain but we do not know the specific bitcoin mining software used. By watching Bitcoin Cloud Services’ payout address, the anonymous source was able to estimate the number of customers receiving payouts, along with BCS’s profits and losses. BCS seems to have started to operate at a loss near the end of April. How did BCS respond? By offering an extra year on their currently available mining contracts. Typical behavior of a Bitcoin cloud mining ponzi scheme.

This offer could be an attempt to keep a Ponzi scheme going for as long as possible. After all, it will last only as long as new money is coming in. The back-of-the-envelope math based on the spreadsheet indicates that the operators could run off with as much as 2,500 BTC ($570,000 at current prices) with a bitcoin mining scam.

If it looks like a duck...

Going back to Puppet’s Cloud Mining 101 thread, it seems clear that he understands the likelihood that BCS is a Ponzi scheme. The thread lists seven different criteria that are usually found in a Ponzi scheme, and BCS fits the bill in six out of seven criteria. The only test that BCS seems to have passed is having pictures of their mining facility on their website. Of course, as Puppet notes in his thread, “Pictures can be faked.” This seems to be what has happened in the case of Bitcoin Cloud Services. Puppet currently has BCS listed under “Likely Ponzi scams that have yet to collapse,” and it’s unclear how long BCS will be able to keep up the charade. Up to this point, Puppet has been correct with 95 percent of his calls of a probable Bitcoin cloud mining ponzi scheme. Bitcoin Magazine has reached out to BCS for comment.",,-0.8021
2015/6/18,Ex-U.S. Agent Charged With Bitcoin Theft to Plead Guilty,"In March of 2015, two federal agents who helped conduct one of the major investigations in the Silk Road case allegedly stole thousands in bitcoin confiscated from the online dark marketplace. The two agents, Shaun Bridges and Carl Force from the Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Secret Service, were charged with several offenses including wire fraud and money laundering.

This week, Bridges, a special agent for the U.S. Secret Service for the Silk Road case, has come to an agreement with the prosecutors and pleaded guilty for the theft of confiscated bitcoin from Silk Road.

Bridges took part in a Baltimore task force as a computer forensics expert where he contributed to an investigation which acquired enough evidence to accuse Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road for allegedly hiring assassins to murder six individuals that threatened the marketplace.

During the operation, Bridges stole thousands in bitcoin by obtaining the passwords to Silk Road from the marketplace’s customer support representative and moved the bitcoin to his own personal account.

Specifically, the prosecutors claimed that the stolen bitcoin were transferred into Japanese bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, to convert the bitcoin into U.S. dollars and then move it to his bank account.The bitcoin stolen by Bridges are said to be worth around $820,000, which is equivalent to around 3,565 bitcoin, at today’s bitcoin price.

Bridges Pleads Guilty to Theft

This week, in a filing at the San Francisco federal court, Bridges agreed to plead guilty for the theft of bitcoin that once belonged to Silk Road and to two other charges: money laundering and obstruction of justice.

“Mr. Bridges has regretted his actions from the very beginning,"" Bridges’ lawyer, Steve Hale Levin said. ""His decision to plead guilty reflects his complete acceptance of responsibility and is another step towards rehabilitation.”

Back in March, however, Bridges and Levin strongly denied the accusations.“Mr. Bridges, a former law enforcement officer with an unblemished record, maintains his innocence. He will fight the charges in the appropriate place at the appropriate time,” Levin said at the time.

The hearing date of the other agent behind the theft of bitcoin from Silk Road has been rescheduled to August, around the same time Bridges is required to submit a plea.",,-0.9712
2016/2/19,"Insufficient Backups, Not Bitcoin, at Fault as Hollywood Hospital’s Data Held Ransom by Hackers","In a February 17 letter, Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center President & CEO Allen Stefanek said, “…the amount of Bitcoins requested was 40 Bitcoins, equivalent to approximately $17,000.” 

This is the number of bitcoins that the HPMC transferred to a hacker or hackers in exchange for the decryption key to the malware locking them out of their IT systems. The hospital’s network was under attack for 11 days (February 5-15 ) before Stefanek paid the ransom. 

While headlines jested about a hospital staff reverting back to pre-1990s procedures when paper and pen were the data medium of the day, a technological regression on this order, when lives are at stake, required a calculation. Stefanek and the hospital had to decide whether people’s lives were worth 40 bitcoins. 

Ultimately, HPMC calculated their losses and liability and paid. This type of Bitcoin-based ransomware has been on the rise since 2013 when it is estimated that more than 200 malware programs were being released every minute of that year. 

Initially, there was CryptoLocker, the ransomware that demanded about $300 in bitcoins from the personal computer user before wiping their hard drives. In early 2015, security companies McAfee and Symantec warned of the CTB-Locker (Curve Tor Bitcoin Locker). This elliptical curve encryption ransomware, spread through spam campaigns, locks users out of their files. Paying a Bitcoin ransom is the only way to retrieve the 3,072-bit key. 

As of January 2016, hackers have been deploying ransomware against websites to shake them down as well. Reports estimate that malware-as-service is now becoming one of the fastest growing trades on the darknet markets. The FBI assumes that there are around 200 hackers responsible for the current malware fiasco. 

As more attacks are launched against personal computer users, websites, and even hospitals, the numbers of Bitcoin related ransomware attacks that are paid will increase, with the HPMC serving as a example for other hackers.  

The comparatively paltry sum of 40 bitcoins recently ransomed from HPMC represents a new iteration in the morphing nature of ransomware targets: soft targets that have excellent insurance and will be inoperable without access to their data. 

By asking for a reasonable sum, the hackers are forcing the victims to pay the ransom and write off the cost as an operation expense. Stefanek explains in the letter, “The quickest and most efficient way to restore our systems and administrative functions was to pay the ransom and obtain the decryption key.  In the best interest of restoring normal operations, we did this.” 

A move like this can create potential liabilities in the future for HPMC because targets that pay the ransom are often retargeted, but it was imperative that the hospital have its EMR (Electronic Medical Record) service operable. 

The simplest solution to the problem is that systems, sites and files should all be backed up in secure locations offline as a fail safe against attack. Such services exist, but individuals and organizations typically don't think to use them until an attack already has occurred. 

Some believe entities such as hospitals should be required by law to be more responsible with patient data. 

Similar security weaknesses were exposed following the hack of Target’s TGT security and payments system in 2013. After that hack, consumers became aware of how lackadaisical the retail giant had been with their customer’s data. Increased Bitcoin ransomware attacks could result in resiliency in the area of Bitcoin’s “untraceability” and of private data management systems. ",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.7966
2016/2/29,New OBPP Report Outlines Troubling State of Privacy in Bitcoin Wallets,"Although Bitcoin has a reputation as a haven for criminals who wish to transact online in an anonymous manner, it doesn’t appear the currently available wallet options are very helpful for this potential use case of the digital cash system. In their second edition of the Bitcoin Wallet Privacy Rating Report, released Sunday, the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project (OBPP) has painted a rather dismal picture of privacy in Bitcoin wallets.

The OBPP report says that many privacy-focused initiatives for Bitcoin “stalled out” in 2015. In the introduction to the report, OBPP contributor Kristov Atlas writes, “Improvements are desperately needed to keep Bitcoin independent and safe.”

Ledger Takes the Top Spot

Although Ledger can rejoice in the fact that it has created the most private Bitcoin wallet on the market, the fact that it scored only 50 out of 100 possible points should give every Bitcoin user pause. Ledger has released a variety of hardware devices, which have been integrated into multiple third-party wallets, but the OBPP’s report focused on the Ledger Nano and the company’s own wallet solution.

In the report, it is noted that Ledger’s Chrome extension-based Bitcoin wallet does not contain advanced privacy features. In fact, it doesn’t even store a local copy of the blockchain. Ledger’s positive marks appear to have come from its ability to assist users in avoiding address reuse and managing multiple accounts within the same wallet.

Coinbase Places Last Again

Coinbase is the service that placed last in the OBPP’s original review of Bitcoin wallets in the spring of last year, and the a16z-backed company has taken the bottom spot again in 2016. Of course, it should be noted that Coinbase offers a variety of services that make it difficult for them to provide high-levels of privacy to its users. In fact, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong recently wrote a Medium post titled ""Coinbase is not a wallet"" about how the company is more of a retail exchange than a wallet provider.

In the OBPP’s report, the custodial nature of Coinbase’s consumer wallet is pointed out as a major flaw. Although Coinbase is required to follow Know-Your-Customer (KYC) guidelines because it also handles fiat money, the report claims some privacy improvements, such as discouraging address reuse, can be made without disrupting the company’s KYC responsibilities.

Coinbase is able to offer mainstream users unique features, such as USD balances, which make it easier for some individuals to interact with Bitcoin as a payment system. Some will say it doesn’t make sense to include Coinbase, which is essentially a Bitcoin bank, in a report about wallets, but it’s important for users to be aware of the privacy-related consequences of using this type of custodial wallet.

Is Privacy in Bitcoin Dead?

This report from the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project will definitely be an eye-opener for individuals who believe they can use Bitcoin privately with a variety of wallets. Perhaps the most troubling aspect of the report is that the world’s two most popular Bitcoin wallets, Blockchain and Coinbase, both scored in the bottom four of all wallet providers.

One of the only bright spots of the report is Samourai, which is ranked sixth in Bitcoin wallet privacy. The report notes a number of promised features that will eventually be integrated into the relatively new wallet option and adds, “The wallet is off to a strong start in 2015, and threatens to usurp Darkwallet for the spotlight in 2016 as the defacto choice for privacy-minded users.”",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.5423
2016/3/11,"Bitcoin Privacy: ""Confidential Transactions"" Feature Can Fix Some of CoinJoin's Problems","Andrew Poelstra is a mathematician at Blockstream and was recently part of a panel discussion on improvements for Bitcoin at the 2016 MIT Bitcoin Expo. During the panel, Poelstra discussed Confidential Transactions, which is a privacy-enhancing feature he has been working on with Blockstream co-founders and Bitcoin Core contributors Greg Maxwell and Pieter Wuille.

One of the main reasons Blockstream is working on Confidential Transactions is to preserve the censorship-resistant properties of Bitcoin and other blockchains.

Scalability Is Not the Only Problem with Bitcoin

Although scalability solutions have been a major area of contention lately, Poelstra understands this is not the only real problem. During his recent appearance at the MIT Bitcoin Expo, Poelstra pointed out the issues related to the public nature of Bitcoin transactions:

“Lately, we’ve been talking about scaling and centralization, but that’s not the only problem with Bitcoin. This one may be a bit attractable, which is that all transactions are public and all of the information in all the transactions are public. This allows a lot of analysis to happen . . . [People] can infer a lot about transactions just from the amounts and also the shape of the transactions.”

Indeed, there are a number of different startups working to deanonymize the Bitcoin blockchain every day. In the past, Stash co-founder and Open Transactions creator Chris Odom has stated these companies could go out of business as more privacy-enhancing features are enabled on the blockchain.

Centralization of Mining Threatens Censorship Resistance

At the core of Bitcoin’s value proposition is censorship resistance. Bitcoin has value because it can be used to complete transactions that are likely to be censored on other payment networks. Andrew Poelstra is committed to preserving this aspect of the technology.

The centralization of mining is one of the current weak points in Bitcoin due to the attack vector opened up when the people who are processing transactions can possibly identify transactions they or regulators don’t like. Poelstra hit on this point during the panel discussion at the MIT Bitcoin Expo:

“One reason we’re worried about the centralization of mining is that miners are, sort of, gatekeepers to what transactions can go in the blockchain and what can’t.”

This desire to weaken the negative effects of Bitcoin mining centralization is what pushes Poelstra and others to work on Confidential Transactions. With Confidential Transactions, privacy is improved by cryptographically masking the amounts associated with Bitcoin transactions. When this privacy-enhancing feature is used, onlookers are unlikely to be able to figure out which addresses are change addresses, which means it’s difficult to tell which Bitcoin address is receiving a payment.

Confidential Transactions Can Help

CoinJoin, originally proposed by Greg Maxwell, has been around since 2013, but there are still some major issues with the privacy-focused tool. Poelstra mentioned how Confidential Transactions can improve CoinJoin during the panel discussion:

“It’s very difficult to do a CoinJoin in a way that improves privacy, and it’s also very difficult to measure how much privacy we get. By hiding amounts, we allow combining transactions in a way that we no longer have this clear correlation. [With Confidential Transactions], I have a couple of outputs, Mark has a couple of outputs, and nobody can see the amounts. When we put them together, now it’s just a pile of outputs with no one else associated.”

Keeping scalability in mind, Blockstream has been focused on making Confidential Transactions as efficient as possible. When Confidential Transactions is combined with CoinJoin, it becomes much more difficult to censor transactions as a miner because there is more difficulty associated with identifying the individuals behind specific transactions.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.9404
2016/3/15,OB1 CEO Brian Hoffman Explains Levels of Anonymity in OpenBazaar,"Many people in the Bitcoin community see OpenBazaar as the next iteration of darknet marketplaces, but the first version of this network will not be suitable for those attempting to sell goods or services in an anonymous manner. During a recent guest appearance at the Coinscrum Members Club, OB1 CEO and OpenBazaar project lead Brian Hoffman discussed anonymity on the OpenBazaar network, and he noted that these features have been deferred to a future section of the development roadmap.

At one point during the Q&A session, Hoffman stated, “Right now, it’s fairly obvious, based on your connection information, where you are or where you’re running it from and things like that.”

Privacy and Anonymity Are Key Features for OpenBazaar

Although OpenBazaar will not offer anonymity to its users by default in its first full release, the team behind the project view this feature as a fundamental aspect of the protocol. During his recent appearance at the Coinscrum Members Club, Hoffman said, “I think [anonymity] is, without a doubt, one of the most important, fundamental things that we need to have in OpenBazaar.”

Hoffman added:

“If you hear anybody say that we don’t care about that, it’s patently false. We definitely do. It just becomes a matter of how you do that gracefully without scaring off any other clearnet type users.”

Hoffman also noted that a roadmap for incorporating more anonymity into OpenBazaar has been developed.

Growing OpenBazaar on the Clearnet

The plan to avoid anonymity for now should not be viewed as a dismissal of the need for this type of functionality. Instead, the deferment of these features to a later date is part of a grander vision. Hoffman described the OpenBazaar developers’ perspective on anonymity during his recent Coinscrum Members Club appearance by asking a question:

“What is the best way to bootstrap a decentralized, private marketplace without basically inviting all of the darknet marketplaces to just shift their stock onto this and scare the crap out of any potential normal user from joining OpenBazaar?”

Hoffman then explained that deferment of anonymity for users would be the best strategy to help the network attract more buyers and sellers over the long term:

“We’ve basically deferred it to a little bit later in the development process. This, we hope, will give us time to establish a baseline of nodes on the network and liquidity of items without overwhelming it with just darknet items.”

While it’s possible that portions of the OpenBazaar network could become the new, decentralized hub of darknet commerce, the developers behind the project also want to see the general public use the platform for legal commerce.

Technical Reasons for Deferment

In addition to the strategic reasons for temporarily avoiding anonymity, the OpenBazaar team is also currently avoiding Tor integration for technical reasons. Hoffman explained:

“One of the reasons we’ve also deferred it technically is that we’re using a UDP network. If you’re not familiar with that, it’s not compatible with Tor, which is kind of the primary [anonymizing network].”

Hoffman said the team is also looking at i2p as a possible option for anonymizing users. He added that some of the i2p developers are already starting to collaborate with the OpenBazaar team.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.9903
2016/3/18,"Encrypted Email Provider ProtonMail Opens to the Public, Accepts Bitcoin Payments","ProtonMail, the world’s largest encrypted email provider, announced that the service is leaving beta and will be allowing open registrations. ProtonMail is also launching its free iOS and Android mobile applications globally in the Apple App store and Google Play store.

ProtonMail  features end-to-end encryption, which makes it practically impossible for governments, or even ProtonMail itself, to gain access to user messages, ensuring the highest level of security and privacy. The service encrypts and decrypts all data on-the-fly on the client side, which means that emails between ProtonMail users are never stored as plaintext, and therefore the government can’t force their release.

“Strong encryption and privacy are a social and economic necessity. Not only does this technology protect activists and dissidents, it is also key to securing the world’s digital infrastructure,” says ProtonMail co-founder Andy Yen. “This is why, all things considered, strong encryption is absolutely necessary for the greater good.”

The development of ProtonMail started in 2014 at CERN ‒ just like the development of the Web itself ‒ in response to growing concerns about governments spying on peaceful citizens’ email. 

“I am very concerned about the privacy issue, and I was wondering what I could do about it,” Yen posted to a CERN Facebook group. ProtonMail raised its first $550,000 with crowdfunding, followed by a $2 million seed round from Charles River Ventures and Fongit. 

Today, ProtonMail is one of the fastest-growing companies in Switzerland with three offices globally, and was ranked last year by Business Insider as the hottest startup in Switzerland.

The decision to open up ProtonMail is motivated by an increasing trend toward more and more surveillance around the world and growing efforts to undermine online privacy. 

“We understand that governments have concerns when it comes to terrorism and encryption, but undermining our collective security by weakening cryptography is the wrong approach,” notes the announcement.

“The best way to ensure that encryption and privacy rights are not encroached upon is to get the tools into the hands of the public as soon as possible and widely distributing them,” added Yen. “This way, we put the choice in the hands of the consumer, and not government regulators. The past decade has been marked by a massive erosion of privacy and we’re working to reverse this trend. Encrypted communications is the future and ProtonMail is committed to making online privacy a reality again for all Internet users.”

Anyone can open a ProtonMail account without releasing personal information. Interestingly, the sign-up procedure ‒ like ProtonMail itself ‒ works well over Tor. 

“Creating your free secure email account takes less than 2 minutes in most cases,” notes the ProtonMail signup page. The free service includes 500 megabytes of storage, and paid services have been launched recently. The cheapest premium plan, at $5 per month ($4 per month if paid annually), includes 5 gigabytes of storage and a custom domain. Current payment options are credit cards, PayPal and Bitcoin.

The Bitcoin payment option complements the anonymity of the signup process and the possibility to sign up and use ProtonMail over Tor. Taken together, these features mean that anonymous users can have premium ProtonMail accounts.

ProtonMail is a Swiss company with servers located in secure data centers in Switzerland, and is protected by privacy-friendly Swiss laws. In 2015, Bitcoin company Xapo relocated its corporate headquarters to Zurich to take advantage of the same privacy-friendly laws. Xapo’s primary deep cold storage vault was already located in Switzerland.

This is one of many parallels between ProtonMail and Bitcoin. ProtonMail wants to put privacy back into the Internet, which is increasingly controlled by governments and corporations as shown by the current dispute between Apple and the FBI over encrypted communications. 

Bitcoin, which in theory permits private payments on the Internet, is also increasingly controlled by governments and corporations in ways that can void privacy. However, there are initiatives such as Zcash that promise to put private payments back into the Internet.

""ProtonMail and Bitcoin actually have a long history together,” Yen told Bitcoin Magazine. “Back in 2014 when PayPal instituted a payment block against us, we relied on BTC donations to keep the service running.""

""We view the Apple case as very troubling, and unfortunately, Apple is likely to lose this one in the court of opinion since the FBI picked their case very carefully,” added Yen. “However, Apple is not Lavabit [an encrypted webmail service, used by Edward Snowden, which was shut down by the US government], and if the world's largest tech company is standing on the side of privacy, the entire movement just gained a very powerful ally.""",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.3182
2016/3/24,Is Bitcoin the New Swiss Bank Account (And Is That a Problem?),"Bitcoin was embraced by many for its libertarian ideals of economic liberty and individual sovereignty. But it has now effectively been dragged into the current, and very public, privacy debate between Apple and the FBI.

Last week, President Barack Obama said he believes a balance must be sought between privacy and security. As one example of the risks of strong encryption, and seemingly referring to cryptocurrencies, Obama pointed out that if government can't access phones, “everybody is walking around with a Swiss bank account in their pocket.”

To find out where Bitcoin's industry representatives stand on this issue, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Bitcoin Foundation director Bruce Fenton Coin Center director of research Peter Van Valkenburgh, and senior fellow at the libertarian think tank Cato institute and former Bitcoin Foundation board member Jim Harper.

Encryption and Law Enforcement

The current debate on encryption started when recent acts of terrorism in San Bernardino, California brought about a highly publicized showdown between Apple and the FBI.

After a San Bernardino couple, Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people, the FBI found Farook’s iPhone 5C was locked with a password and data encrypted. The action of the FBI to seek the decryption from the terrorist Farook’s iPhone brought Apple into the California district court of Judge Sheri Pym, who ruled Apple should offer “reasonable technical assistance” to law enforcement, and must provide a tool that would allow federal agents to beat a security feature that prevents the phone from erasing after some failed unlocking attempts.

Apple CEO Tim Cook, however, worries that creating a patch to enable entry through a back door threatens the ability to maintain privacy for its hundreds of millions of customers worldwide.

This sentiment was echoed by Bitcoin industry representatives.

Bitcoin Foundation director Bruce Fenton – who also organizes the industry's Satoshi Roundtable – took over as director of the foundation last year.

Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, he stated:

“There are those who believe privacy is a right and there are those who believe that it is not. I don't support efforts to erode privacy under claims of defense from imaginary threats.”

Jim Harper, who at Cato works to adapt law and policy to the information age, wholeheartedly agreed.

“Weakening encryption for terrorism investigations, money laundering prevention and tax collection would cost more in lost security for everyone than it would benefit us through greater security, crime control and fattened government coffers,” Harper said. “I've personally been working for several years to strengthen Fourth Amendment doctrine in the Supreme Court. My work may help courts recognize that conscripting Apple into writing code that breaks its security is a Fourth Amendment seizure of Apple's resources, and an unreasonable one.”

Implications for Bitcoin

Several Bitcoin wallet apps currently offer “zero knowledge security” which ensures user data by generating private keys completely client side.

But what happens if Pandora’s Box is opened? What if encryption is weakened or even broken by state agencies?

Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, sees trying to break the encryption protecting one phone as having “extremely damaging implications” for the rights of many millions of people worldwide, with possible effects on their physical and financial security.

Obama, meanwhile, seemed to suggest that this kind of financial security should in fact not be absolute. He believes a balance must be struck, suggesting encryption should be weakened to allow government agencies access to encrypted phones in certain cases.

Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center, doubts any technical trade-offs are possible at all.

“You can't weaken encryption,” he explained. “You can only weaken the ability of American companies to compete in the development of secure technologies, and the ability of law-abiding American citizens to have secure tools. If Americans don't build and maintain these tools, then people in other countries or in the underground economy will. Outlawing the use or development of these tools will only hasten the demise of our legitimate institutions as they would continually fail to compete with international or extralegal institutions that are not hobbled by impractical restrictions.”

But what if it is indeed technically possible to completely shut state agencies out of phones? Should that be considered a problem? Should we as a society be concerned about citizens walking around with Swiss bank accounts in their pockets, as Obama suggested?

Fenton doesn't believe so.

“My first reaction to the president's statement was: 'So what?' Why should the federal government care if people have a bank account in their pocket? That is a technological achievement, and, in itself, is nothing close to a crime that government should be concerned with,"" Fenton said.

He added:

“It is concerning when politicians reach far from concerns about crimes that have actual victims to areas which are more about restricting freedom than protecting citizens. I think we do need to worry about the trend of government officials who push the idea that citizens having privacy and control of their own money is somehow a bad thing. It's only in recent years, with the proliferation of credit cards and online banking, that government has become so presumptive about their rights to our privacy. I think this is much more dangerous than whatever drawbacks that privacy may have.”

Tax Implications

The main reason Obama used the Swiss bank analogy is probably tax evasion. Using Bitcoin, it becomes increasingly easy for users to hide vast amounts of wealth, which enables citizens to avoid certain forms of tax evasion.

Industry representatives actually shared this concern – or at least believe the concern is valid.

Though, according to Fenton:

“The tail should not wag the dog regarding taxes and Bitcoin. Commerce, innovation and jobs come first. The IRS for decades had to deal with cash-based economies where it was very difficult to track real income and revenue. They should adjust and do whatever they need to do to adapt to new technology; we should not delay or impede innovation for concern that the IRS may have a harder job.“

Harper believes potential tax evasion issues will eventually call for alternative solutions.

“In decades or perhaps even a century, Bitcoin or successor currencies and transaction mechanisms may narrow the field of taxable transactions,” he said. “Fully digital transactions will be too fluid to catch or may lack a recognizable physical jurisdiction. This will push tax collection toward physical things like housing, durable goods, and disposable goods. It's all a long way off, though, I'll emphasize.”

Money Laundering

Another problem often brought up regarding Bitcoin is money laundering. Increased anonymity and the inability of law enforcement to block or regulate the flow of funds enables criminals to use Bitcoin for nefarious purposes.

Fenton:

“People like New York State's former Superintendent of Financial Services Ben Lawsky, who's responsible for the BitLicense, seem to take it as a given and indisputable fact that money laundering is a horrible crime. I challenge that notion. In most cases of money laundering there is no clear victim, no person or people who were actually harmed. Opportunists make the leap of saying that things like terrorism will be more prevalent because of money laundering, but this is hogwash. Terrorism is more of a risk because of things like bad foreign policy than money laundering. Could technologies like Bitcoin make life easier for criminals? Of course. Just as shoes, the Internet and mobile phones do. New technologies make things easier for everyone. Regulators and thief supporters would be better off spending time focusing on violators of the law than on technologies.”

Harper agreed:

“I don't worry about degrading governments' power to curtail money laundering because it is a regulatory crime, not a genuine wrong. Money laundering controls probably cost more in compliance expense and curtailed trade (especially internationally) than they provide in security, crime control and quality-of-life benefits. We're worse off as a society because of money laundering laws and the financial surveillance that supports them.”

As such, the question is what the Bitcoin community can do to protect itself against potential weakening of encryption or breaches of security. Should Bitcoin companies and users accept certain trade-offs, or should they move to protect themselves?

Harper prefers the latter.

“Our best defense is going to be shifting to open source, non-proprietary communications and transaction tools. Such tools don't have a head office that can be bought off, bullied, or required by law to render themselves insecure. It's going to be hard to make that shift, but there's no time like the present to get started,” he said.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.3768
2016/3/24,Zcash CEO Zooko Discusses Privacy and Efficiency Tradeoffs vs the Bitcoin Blockchain,"        Zcash, which is an implementation of the zerocash concept, is often referred to as the first form of truly anonymous digital cash. While Bitcoin been called a haven for criminals by many misinformed individuals, the reality is Satoshi Nakamoto’s creation is a mostly-transparent ledger.

Although Zcash enables the highest level of privacy currently allowed by cryptography, there are still some potential issues (mostly unrelated to privacy) for the financial-anonymity protocol to overcome. Zcash CEO Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn recently discussed some of these issues on Epicenter Bitcoin.

Privacy Preserving Spends Take a Minute or Two to Generate

The main issue with Zcash right now is that generating a new privacy-preserving spend is somewhat inefficient. Zooko, as he is commonly known, explained this issue during his recent Epicenter Bitcoin appearance:

“The current alpha code that we have running on a testnet ‒ it takes like about a minute or two of CPU time to generate a new privacy-preserving spend and only like a few milliseconds, I think, to verify. The latter part is for the good for performance, and that’s really important because all the full nodes and the miners have to be doing verifications all the time. The former part is pretty bad because it takes a whole minute or two on like a high-powered, supercomputer 64-bit laptop CPU.”

Zooko also added that privacy-preserving spend generation likely requires more than 4 gigabytes of RAM, although he also mentioned that they don’t have precise measurements on RAM requirements quite yet.

In regard to the consequences of the current system requirements involved with privacy-preserving spends, Zooko stated:

“That is totally prohibitive for certain use cases like generating a new spend on your smartphone, for starters. Also, anything that’s got a real low-latency requirement where you get incoming money you receive and then like a millisecond later you need to spend that money to someone else right away ‒ that’s totally impossible with the current protocol.”

With the current version of Zcash, there are definitely efficiency and usability tradeoffs. Having said that, this system is also intended to give users the highest level of financial anonymity and privacy.

Getting Around Zcash’s Efficiency Issues

Although Zcash’s privacy-preserving transactions are somewhat inefficient, the digital currency’s users also have the ability to make traditional, transparent transactions, which are similar to Bitcoin transactions. Zooko explained that using a hybrid of privacy-preserving and transparent transactions on the Zcash blockchain can still offer many advantages over a traditional Bitcoin transaction. 

“The existence of the privacy-preserving transactions means that they break the links of the chain of transaction history,” the Zcash CEO noted.

Zooko also explained how a combination of private and non-private transactions would work in greater detail:

“There might be ways around it because if you have a buffer of money you can spend it using a privacy-preserving payment, so there’s no linkage between where it came to you. Then, you can privately spend it to a new address. So, there’s no linkage in the blockchain between where you got it and that new address that currently controls it. Then, you could do a non-private spend of it directly from that address.”

Having said that, Zooko also stated this type of usage of the Zcash blockchain will not offer the greatest level of privacy for its users. He stated:

“Earlier I said, ‘Zcash offers the maximum possible privacy that cryptography can provide.’ And that is true ‒ if all you ever do with it is the privacy-preserving spends. Then, you’re putting as little information as possible into the blockchain.”

Missing Out on Some of Bitcoin’s Functionality

In addition to Zcash’s efficiency issues, the “HTTPS for money” also cannot enable many useful features of Bitcoin in its subset of privacy-preserving transactions. Zooko explained:

“There’s a bunch of functionality in the Bitcoin ‒ or the globally transparent protocol ‒ that we can’t do with a privacy-preserving spend ‒ like multisignature transactions. Those are really important in Bitcoin. There’s a lot of really cool things being built with multisignature transactions.”

He then clarified his point further:

“Zcash can do multisignature transactions using the globally transparent subset of the protocol, but when you want to do a privacy-preserving spend, you can’t do multisignature.”

Although there are still some issues with the Zcash protocol, it’s clear that the availability of a truly anonymous cash system is desired by the vast majority of the digital currency community. This sort of cryptographically-ensured privacy should become more usable over time. Perhaps the currently-available testnet version of Zcash should be viewed as an early preview of what’s to come in the future of privacy-conscious digital currencies.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.3612
2016/3/29,Bitcoin Wallets as Swiss Bank Accounts: The Developer's Perspective,"Bitcoin was seemingly dragged into the very public debate on privacy and encryption recently. Specifically, President Barack Obama  warned that if the government can't access phones, “...everybody is walking around with a Swiss bank account in their pocket,” which appeared to refer to cryptocurrency.

Last week, Bitcoin Magazine  reported on Bitcoin's industry representatives and their positions on encryption, privacy, Bitcoin's role in tax evasion and money laundering and more. In part two of our coverage: What do the actual builders of these pocket-sized “Swiss bank accounts” think?

Bitcoin Magazine reached out to  Electrum developer Thomas Voegtlin,  Breadwallet CEO Aaron Voisine,  Mycelium developer Leo Wandersleb and  Ledger CTO Nicolas Bacca to see where they stand.

Broken

The debate on encryption and privacy caused by the ongoing dispute between Apple and the FBI took a sharp turn this week. The United States Department of Justice had long claimed it was unable to access encrypted iPhones without help from Apple, but this turned out not to be true.

Although the Department of Justice did not explain how they got access to the phone, the Bitcoin wallet developers Bitcoin Magazine spoke to were not surprised that they could.

Ledger CTO Nicolas Bacca speculated: “To get access to the data, the FBI probably relied on some kind of physical attack involving the flash memory. Swapping the flash memory or disabling writes could get you infinite retries, so you can brute force the access code. The operating system doesn't handle that securely.”

Bacca also pointed out that Bitcoin itself is much more secure than a typical iPhone.

“I believe Bitcoin is less at risk against physical attacks compared to other cryptosystems, because you always get a way to invalidate a possibly compromised key - just send the coins to a different address if you notice quickly enough. The issue is properly qualifying how long is that.”

Balance

While the FBI demands Apple help the government agency access encrypted iPhones, the tech company maintains that weakening encryption could result in a privacy disaster. Obama, explaining his position last week, argued it's important to find the right balance between privacy and security, suggesting weakened encryption should be an option.

But this option was firmly rejected by all wallet developers Bitcoin Magazine spoke to.

Electrum developer Thomas Voegtlin explained:

“In the physical world, you can design a door that is difficult to break. This means that someone may be able to force that door, but not covertly, and that is why we have a balance between privacy and security. But computers are devices that tend to make things binary. In the world of computing, you either do have the key, and opening the door is very easy, or you don't, and it is impossible. If we give a special key to the government, they will be able to open millions of doors with that key, with no effort, and without attracting attention. Nothing will prevent someone from misusing that key, and eventually the key will be leaked and fall into the wrong hands. A technological backdoor is the modern equivalent of the  Ring of Gyges.”

Ledger's Nicolas Bacca agreed.

“As a society I believe we should be extremely worried about calls to weaken encryption,” Bacca said. “Practically, it cannot be done for a single target, as any 'NOBUS' backdoor turns into a global risk when it's discovered. Ideologically, we already had a clear demonstration that letting agencies run loose with that kind of absolute power was a pretty bad idea. Politically, I believe it can lead to important economic collateral damages, which is another good reason to avoid doing it.”

Voisine agreed with this assesment as well. Moreover, the Breadwallet developer argued that strong encryption is itself a balancing factor against the widespread data monitoring, not a factor that itself requires balance.

“Privacy is core to the human experience. Imagine if your landlord or your extended family knew exactly how much money you had at any given time, and how much you spent and when. It would be a disaster. Privacy is a leveler that allows parties with otherwise unequal bargaining power to negotiate on equal footing. It’s even required by law in many situations, such as with the finances of publicly traded firms. Intentionally weakened encryption is absolutely something that we should all be worrying about. In a future world with the potential for ubiquitous surveillance, strong encryption available to individuals will be the counterbalancing force,” Voisine said.

Taxation

Perhaps the main reason Obama cited the Swiss bank account example was to point out that strong encryption could allow citizens an easy escape from certain types of taxation. More specifically, Bitcoin users can potentially store significant amounts of wealth on their phones without government agencies knowing about it, or even being able to touch it.

Mycelium developer Leo Wandersleb, however, questioned whether that should be considered a problem at all.

Wandersleb:

“So Obama is worried that government might not have ultimate power over its citizens' assets? Help me, why again does he assume the right to have that power? I'm not a U.S. citizen, so excuse me if I'm not too firm with regard to the Constitution and its amendments ... but I know of nothing that would say 'all property is yours unless the government doesn't agree.'”

Electrum's Voegtlin took a slightly more moderate position.

“I am not an anarchist, and my involvement with Bitcoin is not motivated by anti-government ideology. I believe in a society with government, with taxes and law enforcement. I write Bitcoin software because I believe that the benefits of cryptocurrency, for society and for our economies, far outweigh the risks. However, we should not be denying there are risks. New technologies always carry new risks.”

But the answer to combating these risks is not to encroach on encryption, Voegtlin pointed out. Rather, he believes the risks should be mitigated through alternative means.

Voegtlin:

“I think that law enforcement and taxation will need to adapt to cryptocurrency. In 2011, Pirate Party founder Rick Falkvinge  proposed that, in a world with Bitcoin, governments should tax consumption, rather than wealth or income. I believe that level of thinking is appropriate.”

Voisine, too, believes the answer will eventually be looked for in alternative methods of taxation.

“There are many tax revenue streams that are difficult to avoid even with the leveling power of privacy putting the individual on a more equal footing with the state. Two examples are use taxes and property taxes. As the industry grows and the world moves their wealth into Bitcoin, I think we will see a gradual shift toward more heavy reliance on these types of income streams by the state. This has the added benefit of making the true cost of state services and programs more transparent. Privacy for individuals and transparency for the state is a wonderful thing.”

Security

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Bitcoin wallet developers have no intention of weakening the security or decreasing the privacy they offer. Rather, most intend to increase both the security and privacy of their products where possible.

Mycelium currently uses a server-based model, which means governments could potentially pressure the wallet provider to give up certain privacy sensitive information or provide false transaction data to users.

But Wandersleb explained the wallet intends to improve this:

“We are working on removing ourselves from the equation. Our new wallet will not depend on our servers, so there will be no single point of failure. It will also be open source, so even if we were forced to weaken our product, others could choose to distribute reliable versions. Lastly, Mycelium works with hardware wallets that provide a very good protection against broken operating systems.”

Bacca's Ledger is one of the companies working with Mycelium to realize this solution. Bacca explained:

“We are building additional security layers directly on the phones when we can, and we're also building a new hardware wallet device, Ledger Blue. This provides open applications development on a Secure Element, which a phone can use over Bluetooth low-energy. That would be close to the hypothetical doomsday device referred to by Obama.”

And Voisine, too, emphasized that privacy and security remain top priorities for Breadwallet.

Voisine:

“A Swiss bank in every pocket empowers the individual in incredible ways we've never seen before. It's time that this option becomes available to the whole world, not just the wealthy and politically connected, and we are going to give it to them.”",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.9388
2016/4/14,The Power of Schnorr: The Signature Algorithm to Increase Bitcoin's Scale and Privacy,"Segregated Witness has entered its  final testing stage before roll-out on the Bitcoin network. That is  good news, most importantly because the innovation introduces a capacity increase to allow for more transactions on the network, while it also solves  transaction malleability.

And, it introduces script versioning ‒ an extension to the Bitcoin protocol that allows for an entire new category of innovation.

One of these imminent innovations has been on the top of several Bitcoin developers’ wish-lists for some time: Schnorr signatures.

With the impending release of Segregated Witness, implementation of the Schnorr cryptographic signature algorithm might follow soon after, potentially improving Bitcoin's scalability, efficiency and privacy, all in one go.

Here's how.

Signatures

First, a brief re-cap: what are signatures?

At the heart of Bitcoin lies the mathematical trick called “public key cryptography,” a cryptographic system that uses two kinds of “keys” (really strings of numbers): private keys and public keys.

A private key and a public key are mathematically linked. But while it's very easy to produce a public key from a private key, it's practically impossible to produce the private key from a public key. It's a “one-way street.”

In order to spend bitcoins from a particular Bitcoin address, one must prove “ownership” (or: knowledge) of the private key that refers to the public key associated with that address. And to prove ownership of a private key, without having to reveal that private key, a cryptographic signature is used.

A signature is created by performing a calculation using the transaction data and the private key. And here's where the magic of public key cryptography comes in: Knowing the public key, anyone can see if the correct private key was used to create the signature. Without ever needing to know the private key itself.

The “owner” of the private key can therefore sign a transaction and spend bitcoins without worrying that someone else can take that private key and steal the bitcoins; the private key is never exposed, and the signature is only valid for that specific transaction.

(For a more elaborate explanation of public key cryptography in Bitcoin, see  this article. Or, just keep reading. While the basic signature concept matters, the details are not crucial for the purpose of this article.)

Schnorr

So what, then, are Schnorr signatures?

Schnorr, named after its inventor Claus-Peter Schnorr, is a signature scheme: the series of mathematical rules that link the private key, public key and signature together. Many cryptographers consider Schnorr signatures the best in the field, as they offer a strong level of correctness, do not suffer from malleability, are relatively fast to verify, and ‒ importantly ‒ support multisignature: several signatures can be aggregated into a single, new signature.

However, until now it has not been possible to utilize Schnorr in Bitcoin. Another type of signature scheme, Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), is baked into the Bitcoin protocol, and changing that would require a hard fork.

That's where Segregated Witness comes in.

With Segregated Witness, all signature data is moved to a separate part of the transaction: the witness, which is not embedded in the “old” Bitcoin protocol. And thanks to script versioning, almost any rule applied in the witness can be changed through a soft fork. Including the type of signature scheme used.

This opens the door for Schnorr.

Capacity

The Schnorr property that stands to benefit Bitcoin most is multisignature aggregation.

Many Bitcoin transactions include multiple inputs, referring to the addresses bitcoins are sent from. (This can be compared to how cash payments often consist of multiple smaller bills and coins to pay a larger sum of money.) Right now, all these inputs require their own signature, which means all these signatures must be included in a transaction, all must be transmitted over the network, and all must be included in a block.

With Schnorr, however, all inputs will instead require only one combined signature to represent all these different signatures. This offers an obvious data advantage, as only one signature must be included in a transaction, only one must be transmitted over the network, and only one must be included in a block. This means there's more room for transactions.

For example:

Segregated Witness, as proposed by Bitcoin Core, offers a (roughly) 75 percent discount on all data included in the witness rather than the original block. One megabyte of witness data is therefore “weighed” as .25 megabyte, which would leave room for .75 megabyte transaction data in the original block, for a total of 1 megabyte.

If aggregated Schnorr signatures reduce the total size of witness data, say from 1 megabyte to .5 megabyte, this .5 megabyte would then be discounted to 0.125 megabyte, leaving room for up to 0.875 megabyte in the original block. (A capacity increase of about 17 percent.)

The exact amount of added room depends on the types of transactions included in blocks. But rough estimates by Bitcoin Core developer Eric Lombrozo suggest that Schnorr signatures could eventually increase total capacity 40 percent or more – that’s on top of the added 60 to 100 percent already offered by Segregated Witness.

Multisig

The capacity increase as described above is true for regular transactions, as many transactions include more than one input. But the advantage can be even greater in the case of multisig transactions ‒ transactions where a single input itself requires several signatures (typically from different people).

As with normal transactions, no more than a single signature needs to be included in any multisig transaction. No matter how many signatures are required, no matter how many people involved.

This opens the door to vastly more complex smart contract constructions, for a fraction of the data normally required. Whether it's two-of-three, three-of-fifteen or hundred-of-hundred types of multisig transactions, all will carry the same amount of signature data as a typical single-signature transaction.

Privacy

And third, Schnorr signatures could offer another interesting benefit: incentivized privacy.

As mentioned, one transaction can include multiple inputs. Most commonly, these inputs refer to addresses that are all controlled by the same person. (As per the multiple bills and coins example.)

But a privacy-enhancing trick invented by Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell,  CoinJoin, allows different users to combine all their transactions into a single transaction. That one transaction will include multiple inputs coming from different payers, which sends money to multiple outputs, belonging to different payees.

(This can be compared to a group of people throwing their bills and coins together in a basket, which they use to go shopping in different stores to buy the products all of them want. Each individual will get the goods that individual paid for, but it's unlikely any individual's “own” bill paid for the product that individual bought.)

If done right, CoinJoin is a great way to improve privacy on the Bitcoin protocol, as it becomes unclear which inputs paid which outputs exactly, let alone which person paid which person.

CoinJoin is not a new concept. But up until now CoinJoin was typically a bit of a hassle. As such, most people don't bother. And since most people don't bother, those who do bother could automatically be marked as suspicious; potentially defeating the purpose of using CoinJoin in the first place.

But Schnorr signatures can add a new advantage to CoinJoin. It enables all participants in a CoinJoin transaction to not only combine their transactions, but to also combine their signatures. And doing so means the size of the transaction would actually be smaller than all individual transactions combined. Which, in turn, means miners would typically charge a smaller fee to process the transaction.

With Schnorr, therefore, CoinJoin would not only increase privacy, but also – importantly – lower the costs for everyone involved. Indeed, there would be a cost benefit to use the most private option, which might just make it the go-to option for everyone – vastly increasing Bitcoin privacy for all.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.3182
2016/4/20,Zooko: The Financial Industry Is Demanding Privacy for Blockchains,"Although one may assume that the demand for privacy in Bitcoin and other blockchain-based systems is coming from crypto-anarchists and libertarians, the reality is that a huge push for concealing transactions on the blockchain is coming from the traditional financial industry. 

During a recent cryptocurrency event at the Cato Institute, Zcash CEO and longtime cypherpunk Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn made the point that banks, clearinghouses, payment processors and everyone else he’s talked to in the financial industry are the ones who are asking for more privacy on the blockchain.

Financial Industry Willing to Help Bring Privacy to Blockchains

During a panel focused on financial privacy at the recent Cato event, Zooko made it clear that the vast majority of the push for enhanced privacy on the blockchain is coming from banks, but this was not a dismissal of the push for privacy coming from users. Zooko claimed that the increase in privacy solutions for blockchain technologies over the past six to 12 months is a reaction to the demand coming from various financial institutions.

“There is a lot of demand among users, but I don’t know how much they’re willing to stump up. Whereas the financial industry appears [ready to do so],” Zooko said.

Why Is the Financial Industry Demanding Privacy?

Zooko pointed to two main reasons that banks and other financial institutions need privacy for any blockchain they’re going to use:

Banks are thinking about using blockchains to lower their costs, but they also understand that this technology could disrupt their industry. The idea of saving money is obviously attractive, but the disruptive properties of public ledgers are forcing financial services companies to pay close attention to the blockchain ecosystem.
Financial institutions understand that the pervasive lack of privacy in shared ledgers is a roadblock for the use of blockchains in their industry.
In Zooko’s view, all of the use cases that make sense for the financial industry, such as trading and settlement, require flexible layers of privacy that allow specific individuals or organizations to have access to data related to each transaction.

“For both regulatory and business reasons, if you’re going to have a shared database of financial information, there is no use case that I’ve found yet where it’s OK for everyone who accesses the database to be able to read all of the financial information in the database.”

Removing Read-Access from the Blockchain

Zooko also noted that the true innovation of Bitcoin was the way it altered how read-and-write-access works for financial ledgers. He explained:

“Bitcoin was really innovative because it made write-access cryptographic instead of centralized ‒ that’s basically the most important thing about Bitcoin. At the same time, it made read-access ubiquitous ‒ everyone can read everything all the time. So this next step that we’re on the cusp of is making read-access cryptographic ... and that appears to be necessary for the applications of blockchains to all of these different [companies in the] financial industry.”

Zooko added that his own company’s Zerocash-based blockchain will allow the creator of a transaction to choose who else can see the details of that transaction on the public ledger. Confidential Transactions and Enigma were two other privacy-focused blockchain improvements mentioned by Zooko at the event.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.2263
2016/4/29,Does the Lightning Network Threaten Bitcoin’s Censorship Resistance?,"The Lightning Network may well be Bitcoin’s primary solution to the issue of scalability, but many skeptics believe there are unresolved issues with this layer-2 system for the blockchain. The possibility of too much centralization via so-called “supernodes” is one of the common criticisms of the Lightning Network, and attached to that is the fear of these new, mostly -centralized payment hubs having the capacity to censor transactions.

Bitcoin Magazine recently reached out to BitGo Engineer and Statoshi.info creator Jameson Lopp to get his thoughts on the possible privacy issues associated with the Lightning Network.

Lightning Network May Offer Better Privacy

Although a loss of privacy is sometimes mentioned as a possible, negative aspect of the Lightning Network, the reality is that it may offer better privacy than the current base layer of the Bitcoin blockchain. This is mainly due to the fact that the blockchain is an open, mostly -transparent ledger that can be viewed by anyone via a block explorer.

Lopp made this point during an interview with Bitcoin Magazine:

“I expect that privacy will actually be better on the Lightning Network than on-chain because transactions are not broadcast to the entire network. It will be much harder to collect analytics on the Lightning Network because routing nodes only know the hop before and the hop after when routing, not the entire route.”

Although not perfect, the Lightning Network does offer the advantage of keeping information related to specific transactions away from an open, transparent ledger. Whether the Lightning Network can offer better privacy than a traditional bank account (where only the bank and the parties involved in a transaction know about it) is an unknown at this point.

Will Nodes Be Forced to Comply with AML and KYC Laws?

One of the main concerns associated with a Lightning Network that has a few entities running nearly all of the nodes is that these nodes will be forced to comply with Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. To this point, Lopp responded, “I understand the AML/KYC fear, but routing nodes are non-custodial.”

Lopp went on to explain that BitGo has based its business around being non-custodial because it means it doesn’t have to deal with all of the regulatory issues associated with holding user funds.

The BitGo engineer also noted that the Lightning Network could still operate in an environment where the laws are changed to fit that regulation-avoiding model. Lopp believes that, much like the Internet, users could simply go around nodes with onerous requirements for routing payments. He added, “In that [scenario], we'll still see plenty of non-compliant nodes.”

A Never-Ending Battle of Privacy vs. Surveillance

It’s possible that the battle between privacy and surveillance will never end. Having said that, those attempting to break privacy on the Internet are usually responding to new technologies created by privacy-minded individuals and organizations.

At this point, it appears that an attack on the level of privacy offered by the Lightning Network would be similar to an attack on the Tor network. Lopp told Bitcoin Magazine, “I imagine that they would need to be a well-funded attacker in order to be able to watch a significant portion of traffic.”

Blockstream’s Rusty Russell and Lightning’s Olaoluwa Osuntokun have been working on bringing onion routing to the Lightning Network, and it’s clear that privacy is given the utmost respect by the developers working on this project.

“I foresee a Tor-style arms race in the future on two fronts,” Russell told Bitcoin Magazine. “One will be the battle against analytics (such as timing attacks) and bugs. The other will be against centralization, which as Bitcoin is learning, is a hard problem that, which is mainly met by (1) making it easy to decentralize, and (2) making sure people are aware of the danger.”

There are always tradeoffs between privacy and usability. Zcash appears to be the most privacy-conscious blockchain today, but there are a few issues with the system when it comes to efficiency. Open Transactions could also be used to implement truly anonymous digital cash, but the federated server model in that system is not as secure as a blockchain (or even the Lightning Network) when it comes to control over one’s funds.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.8886
2016/6/2,Confidential Transactions: How Hiding Transaction Amounts Increases Bitcoin Privacy,"Bitcoin right now is not really anonymous. While Bitcoin addresses aren't necessarily linked to real-world identities, they can be. Monitoring the unencrypted peer-to-peer network, analysis of the public blockchain, and Know Your Customer (KYC) policy or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulation can reveal a lot about who's using Bitcoin, and for what.

This is not great from a privacy perspective. Bitcoin users might not necessarily want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own, while businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors – to name some examples. 

Additionally, bitcoins being traceable, possibly “tainted,” and potentially worth less than other bitcoins is at odds with fungibility. This could even challenge Bitcoin's value proposition as money.

But there are potential solutions to increase privacy, and improve fungibility. 

One of these solutions is “Confidential Transactions.”

Background

As opposed to most digital financial infrastructure, all typical Bitcoin transactions are recorded on the public blockchain, visible for anyone to see. This is required to validate transactions without any centralized authority, but also makes it trivial to trace how many bitcoins are sent from which addresses to which addresses.

To enhance privacy, it is possible to hide the amount of bitcoins transacted. An early version of this concept, then referred to as “bitcoins with homomorphic value,” was first proposed in 2013 by hashcash inventor and current Blockstream president Dr. Adam Back. The idea was later picked up by Bitcoin Core and Blockstream developers Gregory Maxwell and Dr. Pieter Wuille and Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra. This eventually led to the implementation of Confidential Transactions in Blockstream's testnet-sidechain, Alpha.

How It Works

Confidential Transactions combine and utilize several cryptographic tricks, most notably Borromean ring signatures and Pedersen commitment schemes.

Without diving too deep into the cryptographic specifics, these tricks are applied so that only the sender and the receiver of a transaction are aware of the amount transacted. Everyone else would see only that bitcoins are transacted, but not know how many.

The clever thing is that, while some or all amounts are masked for “onlookers,” these onlookers can still use the masked amounts for certain types of calculations. Specifically, all inputs of a transaction can be added up, all outputs can be added up, and the two sums can be compared to ensure they’re equal ‒ all while never revealing any of the masked amounts, nor the sums. As such, nodes can verify that no bitcoins were created out of thin air, without knowing how many bitcoins were actually sent.

(On a side note, one of the amounts is always visible: the mining fee. That's to ensure miners can't award themselves too many fees, and has no further consequences from a privacy perspective. Other amounts can be made visible as well, if the sender or receiver so chooses.)

Soft Fork

Perhaps surprisingly, Confidential Transactions would be more or less compatible with the current Bitcoin-protocol. While the specifics need to be fleshed out, the solution can be rolled out as a soft fork ‒ though it might be a bit “hacky.”

Here's how.

To ensure that “old” (non-upgraded) and “new” (upgraded) nodes would remain in sync, bitcoins used in a Confidential Transaction would first have to be “pass through” an “anyone-can-spend” address. This is a Bitcoin address that anyone can spend from, even without the corresponding private key or signature.

Or so it seems to old nodes.

New nodes would recognize the address as the first step in a Confidential Transaction, and would accept only transactions from that address that do include the correct signature. As long as a majority of hash power applies these rules, the bitcoins on the anyone-can-spend address cannot be stolen by anyone who doesn’t control the corresponding private key. (Old nodes might wonder why no one is spending the freely available bitcoins. But they also wouldn't mind that no one does; from their perspective, no protocol rules are being broken.)

Here's where it gets interesting.

If a Confidential Transaction is made from the anyone-can-spend address, both old nodes and new nodes see that transaction. But they see something different. New nodes would recognize the transaction as a Confidential Transaction, and, for example, check that there are no bitcoins created from thin air. Old nodes, meanwhile, would be tricked into thinking it's a zero-bitcoin transaction: they would believe no bitcoins left the anyone-can-spend address at all.

This logic holds for each subsequent transaction. New nodes would see new transactions, and know that some amount of bitcoin is probably moved from address to address – though they'd have no idea how many. Old nodes, all the while, see “zero-bitcoin transactions,” and believe all the bitcoins are still sitting in the anyone-can-spend address. (Old nodes might wonder why people are sending empty transactions to each other. But again, they wouldn't mind.)

The reason this won't cause havoc (specifically due to incompatible UTXO-sets) is that bitcoins received through a Confidential Transaction can initially be spent only as a Confidential Transaction. They are “locked up” in the anyone-can-spend address for now, and cannot visibly move over the Bitcoin blockchain at all.

In order to be able to spend these bitcoins in a normal transaction again, they must first “pass through” the original anyone-can-spend address. The receiver of a Confidential Transaction would have to send them back to the anyone-can-spend address, and from there start moving the coins in clear sight on the blockchain again.

Once they start moving in clear sight again, new nodes would check that not too many coins are being moved, while old nodes would simply assume the coins are moving for the first time since they were “locked up.”

As such, the anyone-can-spend address effectively functions as a cloaking device. Passing through the anyone-can-spend address makes the amounts of subsequent transactions invisible to all nodes. The bitcoins would “re-appear” only after they’ve made it back to the original anyone-can-spend address.

Downsides and Trade-offs

Unfortunately, Confidential Transactions are no silver bullet for privacy.

Most obviously, while Confidential Transactions mask amounts, onlookers can still see which address is paying which address.

But there are potential solutions to solve this as well.

For one, it's trivial to create false negatives and pay zero bitcoins to several addresses to obfuscate where the bitcoins really went. Additionally, Confidential Transactions could be particularly useful in combination with CoinJoin, which combines sending and receiving addresses from several transactions into a single, large transaction.

Another potential weakness of Confidential Transactions is that masked amounts are really only masked for that particular transaction. This can be rather pointless if a subsequent transaction is not a Confidential Transaction. The information from later transactions can sometimes be used to retroactively calculate how many bitcoins must have been involved in the Confidential Transaction.

(For example: If Alice sends an unknown amount of bitcoins to Bob, and Bob subsequently sends 5 bitcoins to Carol and 2 to himself as change, it obviously means Alice sent 7 bitcoins to Bob.)

This means that Confidential Transactions are really useful only if such use is widespread. But that brings us to a perhaps even bigger problem: Confidential Transactions are quite resource-heavy. A Confidential Transaction is about 20 times bigger than a normal transaction, while it even increases computation thirtyfold. As such, the cost of each Confidential Transaction would be significantly higher compared to typical transactions, which provides a disincentive to people actually using them – diminishing their usefulness for everyone else as well.

On top of that, the sheer size of Confidential Transactions puts them at odds with either scalability (as the Bitcoin network would be able to handle fewer transactions), or decentralization (as fewer users would be able to run a full node and verify all transactions), or both.

And last but not least: It's not clear that everyone agrees Bitcoin should be more private or fungible, which might further complicate rolling out potential soft forks like these.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.296
2016/6/3,"Microsoft Building Open Blockchain-Based Identity System With Blockstack, ConsenSys","Microsoft has announced that it is collaborating with Blockstack Labs, ConsenSys and developers across the globe on an open source, self-sovereign, blockchain-based identity system that allows people, products, apps and services to interoperate across blockchains, cloud providers and organizations.

The United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals include giving everyone a legal identity by 2030. As a first step, the U.N. wants to develop scalable identity systems by 2020. The inaugural ""ID2020 Summit ‒ Harnessing Digital Identity for the Global Community,"" held at the United Nations headquarters in New York on May 20, brought together policymakers and technology companies to develop an action plan.

“While we don’t profess to have solutions to these overwhelming problems today, we can start where the open source community is best: collaboration,” said Yorke Rhodes III, blockchain business strategist at Microsoft. “To progress toward these goals, we have been working with partners to address identity using the self-owned or self-sovereign qualities of blockchain technology.”

The Microsoft strategist said that the Redmond, Washington, giant is working with Blockstack Labs and ConsenSys to leverage their current Bitcoin and Ethereum-based identity solutions, Blockstack and uPort. Through this open source collaboration, Microsoft and its partners intend to produce a cross-chain identity solution that can be extended to any future blockchains or new kinds of decentralized, distributed systems. In the coming weeks an open-source framework for developers will be made available on Azure.

Blockstack ‒ an open source blockchain application stack ‒ permits building decentralized, serverless apps by plugging into Blockstack's services for identity, naming, storage and authentication.

According to the Blockstack team, Blockstack is the largest, most popular blockchain identity system, with 50,000 registered identities that come with profiles and globally unique names. Identities can be registered for people, companies, websites, software packages and more. Profiles can contain both private and public information, which is attested to by the user and can be verified by peers and select authorities.

“Microsoft will make it easy to deploy new Blockstack servers and infrastructure on the Azure cloud and plans to integrate Blockstack with some internal systems for identity and authentication,” notes the Blockstack blog. “With the Blockstack technology users are in complete control of their usernames and data and don’t need to trust any third party for their information. We appreciate Microsoft’s committed to making the internet a more secure and user-centric place and to promote open-source software development.”

In November Bitcoin Magazine reported that Microsoft had partnered with ConsenSys, a blockchain startup focused on Ethereum technology, founded in October 2014 by Ethereum Foundation’s co-founder Joseph Lubin. In December, Microsoft and ConsenSys announced Ethereum Blockchain as a Service (EBaaS) on Microsoft Azure, to provide a single-click cloud-based blockchain developer environment to Azure Enterprise clients and developers. 

In October, ConsenSys revealed that it was working on an identity management system  called uPort . “[We] have started to integrate an ID and persona construct across all of our dApps,” noted the ConsenSys blog. “Soon a uPort persona will enable access to any dApp ConsenSys or other developers build. ConsenSys has begun efforts to work with various partners towards standardization of these components.” The company added that user-owned ID and data will be crucial for realizing the compelling vision of Web 3.0.

“We’re also collaborating with ConsenSys on a cross-blockchain solution for global namespaces,” notes the Blockstack blog. “We believe that a global identity system should not be dependent on any particular blockchain and users should be able to migrate from one blockchain to another, if needed. Along these lines, we plan to work with ConsenSys to add Ethereum support to the Blockstack server.”

Redmond Magazine notes that there are many unofficial identity systems in the social media world, including the systems operated by Google, Facebook and Microsoft itself, as well as various emerging blockchain-based platforms that have been proposed for the online world. But the U.N. and the companies that participated in the inaugural ID2020 Summit are more ambitious: They want to develop globally recognized identity systems for the real world.

One-fifth of the world’s population ‒ one and a half billion people ‒ are without proper identification, and 50 million children are born every year without a birth certificate and a legal identity. These numbers are growing, which underlines the importance of the U.N. goal of giving everyone on the planet a solid and tamper-proof digital identity based on common, interoperable standards. According to John Farmer, director of technology and civic innovation at Microsoft, blockchain technology can offer three key features to an identity system: It's an immutable, trustless, and transparent agreed-upon network.

“[We] can imagine a world where an individual can register their identity in a cross blockchain fashion, providing a single namespace for lookup regardless of blockchain of choice,” concludes the Microsoft announcement. “[We are] excited by the potential societal benefits that can be derived from an identity that transcends borders, blockchains, organizations and companies.”",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.996
2016/6/8,BIP 151: The End-To-End Encryption Bitcoin Never Had – but Soon Will,"Bitcoin right now is not really anonymous. While Bitcoin addresses aren't necessarily linked to real-world identities, they can be. Monitoring the unencrypted peer-to-peer network, analysis of the public blockchain, and Know Your Customer (KYC) policy or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulation can reveal a lot about who's using Bitcoin, and for what.

This is not great from a privacy perspective. Bitcoin users might not necessarily want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own, while businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors – to name some examples.

Additionally, bitcoins being traceable, possibly “tainted,” and potentially worth less than other bitcoins is at odds with fungibility. This could even challenge Bitcoin's value proposition as money.

But there are potential solutions to increase privacy, and improve fungibility.

One of these solutions is BIP 151, a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal designed to encrypt data among Bitcoin nodes.

The Problem

Traffic over the Bitcoin network has always been unencrypted. Transactions and blocks are sent from node to node in plain sight, as are Bloom filters, which are often used by Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) nodes. All this data can, therefore, be seen by Internet Service Providers (ISPs), open-WiFi providers and anyone monitoring the Bitcoin network.

This has obvious downsides. In the case of full nodes (and miners), information on where transactions and blocks originate can link Bitcoin addresses to IP addresses, which can be used to de-anonymize users. Moreover, ISPs and open-WiFi providers can potentially use the data to block certain transactions, for instance if they send bitcoins to a blacklisted address.

Most SPV-wallets (or lightweight clients – and in particular those based on the Bitcoinj-library) have an additional problem. To check funds, these wallets send out so-called Bloom filters, a mathematical trick that aggregates data into a compact package. Unfortunately, this has proved insecure from a privacy perspective: The packages can be used to reconstruct which Bitcoin-addresses belong to the wallet-user.

While there are some solutions available to encrypt data between nodes already, most obviously Tor and VPN, these are not ideal. For one, these solutions don't work “out-of-the-box” ‒ they require extra software and sometimes special ports. Second, users typically need to rely on infrastructure and people outside of the Bitcoin system (and in particular Tor exit nodes). And there's typically a hit to performance as well.

The Solution

BIP 151, designed and recently proposed by Bitcoin Core developer Jonas Schnelli, is a straightforward solution: It encrypts traffic between nodes.

To avoid potential security risks posed by the much more common TLS/SSL cryptographic standard, BIP 151 proposes to use a cryptographic standard known as “ChaCha20/Poly1305@openssh.” This standard is already used by OpenSSH and the Google-API, among other projects, and is generally considered well-proved. It offers the added advantage of speeding up network traffic; Bitcoin messages currently include a SHA256-hash (another cryptographic standard) of the content, which is relatively “heavy” to compute.

With ChaCha20/Poly1305@openssh, anyone monitoring the network could still recognize packages as Bitcoin data. But they would not know the content of the data. This automatically improves privacy. Additionally, it becomes harder to censor specific transactions or blocks: ISPs or open-WiFi providers can only censor all Bitcoin-data, or none of it.

Realization

While BIP 151 was proposed quite recently, and the review process has just started, there is as of yet little reason to think it can't be safely deployed on the Bitcoin network.

In fact, since BIP 151 has no impact on Bitcoin's consensus layer, any miner, node or wallet on the network can opt in to the solution at any time – even if some other miners, nodes or wallet don't. (If one or both connected nodes don’t apply BIP 151, the data is simply transmitted in plain text – which does, of course, mean the privacy and censorship-resistant benefits don’t hold up either.)

However, the solution might not be completely airtight. It could, at least in theory, be possible, for example, to analyze the encrypted data and conclude how big the message is. Comparing this with the data as it appears in mempools or on the blockchain might reveal which data was sent from a specific node. But all in all, this problem is probably negligible – and it would still be impossible to censor specific content pro-actively.

And, of course, BIP 151 doesn't in itself make Bitcoin private or fungible; it's a mere part of the puzzle. Perhaps the most relevant improvement to be rolled out alongside BIP 151 is a solution for node authentication to ensure a connected peer is a genuine node, not an ISP or WiFi-provider disguised as one. Schnelli is currently working on a solution to ensure node authentication as well.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.8348
2016/6/14,Shuffling Coins to Protect Privacy and Fungibility: A New Take on Traditional Mixing,"Bitcoin right now is  not really anonymous. While Bitcoin addresses aren't necessarily linked to real-world identities, they can be. And it’s possible to learn a lot about who’s using Bitcoin, and for what, by monitoring the unencrypted peer-to-peer network or analysis of the public blockchain, as well as through Know Your Customer (KYC) or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations.

This is not great from a privacy perspective. Bitcoin users might not necessarily want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own, while businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors – to name just a few examples.

Additionally, selected bitcoins being traceable, possibly “tainted” and potentially worth less than other bitcoins is at odds with  fungibility. These privacy-related issues could even challenge Bitcoin's value proposition as money.

But there are potential solutions to increase privacy and improve fungibility.

One of the oldest tricks in the book is coin mixing. More recently, this trick was dusted off, improved and re-introduced in the form of “coin shuffle” protocols.

Traditional Mixing

The concept of mixing coins is not too complicated.

If two or more people wish to obfuscate the trails of the coins they control, they can simply exchange their coins with one another. Each participant of such an exchange will end up controlling coins with a history that's not theirs, while ridding themselves of any coins that do reflect their own activity.

The most straightforward way to mix coins is for users to simply connect, for instance on an internet forum, and agree to send each other specific amounts of coins. However, this option has obvious downsides. Not only must two or more users wish to exchange coins at more or less the same time (and be able to find each other) ‒ they must also trust each other not to run off with coins after receiving them.

Alternatively, users can mix coins through a dedicated mixer, typically hosted on a central server. This concept is straightforward, too: users send coins to the mixer, and the mixer sends different coins back – usually minus a mixing fee. Several of these mixers already exist, such as  bitmixer.io. Some dark net markets use built-in mixers, too.

Unfortunately, centralized mixers suffer from obvious weaknesses. For one, the counterparty risk still exists: Whoever controls the mixer must be trusted to actually send bitcoins back. Meanwhile, the privacy and fungibility problem is not entirely solved either: Whoever controls the mixer knows exactly which coins were exchanged for which coins, and can therefore re-establish the trail.

There’s an alternate solution in CoinJoin. CoinJoin allows users to obfuscate their Bitcoin trails to the outside world by essentially combining several transactions into a single big transaction. This makes it unclear which addresses sent bitcoins to which addresses since all “to” and “from” addresses are lumped together.

But with CoinJoin, trails are not necessarily obfuscated for all participants in the transaction. After all, in order to create a CoinJoin transaction, (some) participants must be able to see which addresses are sending bitcoins to which addresses.

This is the problem CoinShuffle protocols solve.

CoinShuffle

CoinShuffle was a major breakthrough when it was first proposed by researchers from Saarland University in 2014, because it had the potential to decentralize mixing to the extent that no one needed to trust anyone else.

As with typical CoinJoin transactions, CoinShuffle allows different users to submit output addresses to be included into a single transaction in order to obfuscate trails.

The innovation introduced by CoinShuffle is that users can submit an output address, without revealing to anyone else which specific address they submitted. As a result, all participants will know which addresses are receiving bitcoins – but no one will know from which addresses these bitcoins are sent.

This is achieved through a clever protocol.

In short, all participants generate a unique public key (a random string of numbers) with which others can encrypt data, and a corresponding private key with which they themselves can decrypt it. Along a predetermined (and random) order, all participants pass their public keys around, in such a way that one user ends up with all public keys, one user ends up with all-but-one, all the way down to the user who actually got none of them.

The user who got all of the public keys then encrypts his output address with all of the public keys, one for one, in the right sequence. These are layers of encryption that can only be decrypted with all the private keys, one by one, in the right order. This package is handed to the next user, who has all the public keys except for one.

This user decrypts this package with his own private key; he “peels” one layer of the encryption-onion, but still can't tell which output address is “hidden underneath.” Additionally, he encrypts his own output address with all the public keys (but one), and passes both encrypted packages on to the next user. This next user has no idea which package originally came from which user. But he can peel another encryption layer off of both. And, of course, he can encrypt his own output address with all public keys that he got, and pass three encrypted packages on to the next.

This goes on until the very last user, who gets packages containing all the other output addresses, encrypted. But at this point, all the packages have only one layer of encryption left; and this last user can decrypt all of them at once. He then adds his own output address into the mix, constructs one big CoinJoin transaction, and sends it back to all participants to sign.

At this point, all participants can simply verify that their output addresses are  included in the transaction, sign it and broadcast the transaction. (It doesn't really matter who broadcasts, exactly.) No one will ever know who provided which output address.

The much-used  Mycelium Bitcoin wallet might soon include an implementation of the CoinShuffle protocol, that Mycelium has named  Shufflepuff.

CoinShuffle++

While CoinShuffle works as intended, the protocol requires a significant number of steps to complete, which makes it somewhat impractical for day-to-day use. The same researchers from Saarland University, therefore, more recently proposed an improved solution:  CoinShuffle++. CoinShuffle++ essentially does what CoinShuffle does, but faster and better.

Where participants in CoinShuffle generate public and private key pairs, participants in a CoinShuffle++ transaction create “mutual secrets” ‒ also unique strings of numbers. Each participant shares such a string with every other participant, but each shared secret is shared only among two of them; no more, no less.

All participants then “mask” their own output using all the secrets they share. But importantly, these shared secrets are used as both negative values as well as positive values for each pair of participants. (If one participant masks his output with the shared secret 12345, the other participant masks his output with -12345.)

This allows for a nifty trick, as descibed in the Dining cryptographers problem. Once all participants share their masked outputs, they can combine these in such a way that all shared secrets cancel each other out. What's left, at that point, is the grand combination of all outputs – unmasked.

The next challenge is to extract the specific outputs from the combination of all outputs. That's where another mathematical trick comes into play: so-called  Newton Identities. The technical details of this trick are unfortunately beyond the scope of this article, as it wanders far into the complexity of advanced mathematics. But it is essentially accomplished using several different redundant encodings of the message, which participants can apply to locally extract all the original output addresses – without knowing who provided which address.

And importantly, this can be done in a single go, to make it much faster and more efficient than the original CoinShuffle protocol. According to the Saarland University researchers, up to 50 participants may complete the CoinShuffle++ protocol in about 15 seconds; potentially even fast enough for typical point-of-sale situations.

Trade-Offs and Weaknesses

Like most other anonymizing solutions, CoinShuffle protocols improve privacy and fungibility. But they are insufficient to provide full anonymity and fungibility in and of themselves – nor are they free from any weakness.

As one drawback of both CoinShuffle protocols, they can be frustrated by dishonest participants. If even just one of the participants wants to block a successful “shuffle” he can insert “fake” (encrypted) data in the process (or not partake in his part of the process at all).

It is, however, possible to trace the participant trying to frustrate the protocol. As such, the protocol can trivially be restarted without this specific participant. This increases the total time for all mixing, but mixing will complete.

Additionally, many of the weaknesses that pertain to typical CoinJoin transactions hold up for shuffle protocols as well. Most important, if the different amounts sent in the collective transaction aren't equal, it might be possible to figure out which inputs and outputs correspond – defeating the purpose entirely.

Likewise, if all of the “participants” are really one and the same entity pretending to be several – a  Sybil attack – no amount of mixing will make any difference: that one entity can simply connect the only inputs and outputs that aren't his.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.3818
2016/6/28,"Local Trade and Decentralized Exchange: Protecting Privacy When Moving in and Out of Bitcoin
","Bitcoin right now is not really anonymous. While Bitcoin addresses aren't necessarily linked to real-world identities, they can be. Monitoring the unencrypted peer-to-peer network, analysis of the public blockchain and know your customer (KYC) policy or anti-money laundering (AML) regulation can reveal a lot about who's using Bitcoin and for what.

This is not ideal from a privacy perspective. To show some examples; Bitcoin users might not want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own, while businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors.

Additionally, bitcoins being traceable, possibly “tainted” and potentially worth less than other bitcoins is at odds with fungibility. This could even challenge Bitcoin's value proposition as money.

One solution to increase privacy and protect fungibility is to exchange bitcoins for fiat currency without being required to identify yourself.

The Problem

Exchanges, brokerages, money transmitters and other service providers that serve as the “on-ramps” and “off-ramps” between bitcoin and fiat currency, form an important part of the Bitcoin ecosystem. But from a privacy and fungibility perspective, a heavy reliance on these companies is not ideal: Practically all fiat-facing bitcoin-companies are required to apply AML/KYC-checks on their customers.

Moreover, these checks can be (and are sometimes) combined with wider blockchain-analysis, pertaining to the past trail of bitcoins, to in some cases even monitor where bitcoins move to after leaving these services. This allows for extensive mapping of the Bitcoin ecosystem. (In a recent blog post, R3CEV Director of Market Research Tim Swanson even described this as a “de facto Kimberley Process”.) There are some ways to avoid these kinds of checks. Most obviously, users can exchange bitcoins for fiat outside of any exchange, for example, at Bitcoin meetups. But it becomes a bit more tricky online: Users need to trust their counterparty or maybe a dedicated middleman to actually send the bitcoins or wire the fiat currency. Alternatively, converting bitcoins to fiat currency can be done by purchasing Bitcoin debit cards such as Cryptopay or BitPlastic. Converting fiat currency to bitcoins, vouchers such as the Bitupcard may also offer a solution.

Most of these options, however, are rather expensive, clunky or both.

Local Exchange

A perhaps more sophisticated solution is the use of exchanges that don't require identity-checks; there are several.

The earliest of such alternatives is the Finland-based exchange LocalBitcoins, launched in 2012. As opposed to typical exchanges, LocalBitcoins is a platform that does not touch fiat currency itself. Instead, users send the fiat through typical wire transfers or other methods. And, as the name of the website suggests, users can also meet up locally and trade bitcoins for cash on the spot. This allows LocalBitcoins to be more lenient when it comes to AML/KYC-policies – although some sellers do require their counterparty to identify themselves through the LocalBitcoins-platform to some degree. (In the United States, some LocalBitcoins.com sellers have been charged under anti-money laundering laws.)

Building on this concept in 2014, the Mycelium mobile Bitcoin wallet introduced Local Trader: a Bitcoin exchange built right into the wallet. Mycelium users who want to buy or sell bitcoins for cash can make an offer on the Mycelium platform where they indicate a price and maximum distance they’re willing to travel. Once a match is made with another trader, they can meet up and complete the trade locally, typically with cash. The Bitcoin side of the trade is taken care of in-app, which also includes a reputation system.

Decentralized Exchange

However, even if the fiat side of the trade is handled locally, LocalBitcoins and Mycelium types of solutions still rely on a central intermediary to some extent: LocalBitcoins and Mycelium. And in the end, these companies can be required to apply AML/KYC-types of regulation as well - or be shut down entirely. (LocalBitcoins had to cease its operations in Germany back in 2014.) An interesting alternative, therefore, is fully decentralized exchanges that rely on no central intermediary to process fiat or Bitcoin transactions.

A first attempt at establishing a decentralized exchange was Coinffeine, launched in late 2013. Coinfeinne partly solved the counterparty risk – the risk of a trading partner not paying up – through a combination of security deposits and an incremental trading protocol. In short, both parties in a trade, deposit a specific amount of bitcoins into a two-of-two multi-address, requiring a signature from each to unlock. Subsequently, the trading partners trade in incremental amounts: no single trade is bigger than the security deposit. As such, neither trader has an incentive not to pay their part: they would lose their security deposit worth the same amount if they did.

Coinfeinne is a novel idea, but it doesn't hold up as nicely in practice. The security deposits leave room for certain types of fraud or extortion. A victim might, for instance, prefer to get half of his deposit back rather than nothing at all. Additionally, trading in incremental amounts is not exactly user-friendly nor fast, especially if it takes a wire transfer to complete each time.

More recently, the decentralized Bitcoin exchange Bitsquare launched. Bitsquare solved the counterparty problem with dedicated arbiters, as well as – again – security deposits. These deposits are locked up along with the traded bitcoins in a two-of-three multisig address where the third key is held by a dedicated and mutually agreed upon arbiter. As such, the buyer is incentivized to send the fiat currency; he'll lose his deposit otherwise. And once he receives the fiat curremcy, the seller is incentivized to release the bitcoins for the same reason. If either attempts to cheat, the arbitrator helps the victim get his bitcoins. 

To prevent bank-chargeback fraud, Bitsquare limits trades to a maximum between .75 and 1.5 each, for now.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.9599
2016/7/5,Stealth Transactions and Reusable Payment Codes: How Bitcoin Addresses Can Be Hidden in Plain Sight,"Bitcoin, right now, is not really anonymous. While Bitcoin addresses aren't necessarily linked to real-world identities, they can be.

This is not great from a privacy perspective. Bitcoin users might not necessarily want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own, while businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors, to name some examples.

Additionally, bitcoins being traceable, possibly “tainted,” and potentially worth less than other bitcoins is at odds with fungibility. This could even challenge bitcoin's value proposition as money.

But there are potential solutions to increase privacy and improve fungibility.

One solution to address this issue – Stealth Transactions – was introduced in 2014; and a new twist on this concept – Reusable Payment Codes – was proposed last year.

The Problem

In part to increase privacy (there are security benefits as well), it is recommended that Bitcoin users generate a brand new address for each transaction they receive. While this is not an airtight solution in itself, this can make it significantly harder to connect addresses to real world identities ‒ both on the sending and the receiving end of the transaction.

However, this also means that the receiver must share a new Bitcoin address with the sender each time a transaction is to be made. This can be a bit of a hassle and in some cases even impossible (think of donation addresses posted on websites). And it’s not ideal from a privacy perspective either: If the new addresses are shared over an insecure channel, privacy is potentially lost entirely.

Stealth Transactions, first proposed in 2014 by Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd, are designed to solve these problems. They use several cryptographic tricks, mostly based on Diffie-Hellman key exchange, to let users accept payments on addresses they never generated, nor have even seen before.

Under the Hood

This is how Stealth Transactions work “under the hood.”

[Authors note: Since completion of this article, it was brought to my attention that there are actually several slightly different ways to construct Stealth Transactions. The strategy described here is only one particular option.]

Stealth Transactions require the sender and receiver of a transaction to have a (basically non-Bitcoin-related) cryptographic public and private key pair, each. We'll call these the “stealth private keys” and the “stealth public keys.” These “stealth keys” are used in several ways.

The first way is a fairly basic use-case of cryptography, which is, for example, used to encrypt emails. In short (and a bit simplified), the sender can take the receiver's stealth public key and use it to encrypt a message. The receiver – and only the receiver – will be able to decrypt this message with his stealth private key.

(This works the other way around as well, of course: The receiver could encrypt a message for the sender – but that's not really relevant for Stealth Transactions.)

The second trick is slightly more complex. But, again, in simplified form, both stealth private keys can be combined through a mathematical formula, to create a Bitcoin private key. This Bitcoin private key can, in turn, be used to generate a corresponding Bitcoin address. So, using each other’s stealth private key in combination with their own, both sender and receiver can generate this Bitcoin private key and Bitcoin address.

And there is a third trick, in simplified form: This Bitcoin address (but not the corresponding Bitcoin private key) can also be derived from one of the stealth private keys and one of the stealth public keys. As such, either the sender or the receiver can generate the Bitcoin address by combining their own stealth private key with the other's stealth public key.

In Practice

To make a Stealth Transaction, these three tricks are cleverly combined:

Possibly even before any payment was going to be made, the receiver generates a stealth key pair. It's this stealth public key that he,for example, posts on his website as a donation address. (As such, it’s also called the “Stealth Address.”) He doesn't share his stealth private key with anyone at all.

When the sender wants to pay the receiver, he generates a “throwaway” stealth private key for himself; specifically for that one transaction. (It’s actually a “nonce”; just a random string of numbers – but has the same effect.) He then takes the receiver's stealth public key (or Stealth Address) and combines this with his own throwaway stealth private key, to generate a Bitcoin address and sends bitcoins to this Bitcoin address. (Well, almost... but let's assume that for a moment.)

At this point, no one can spend the bitcoins on this address because no one knows (nor is able to generate) the corresponding Bitcoin private key.

But here's the heart of the trick: the sender can allow the receiver to spend the bitcoins by sharing his throwaway stealth private key with him. With that throwaway stealth private key, the receiver would have both stealth private keys required to generate the Bitcoin private key.

Interestingly, this is accomplished all at once, within the transaction that funds the Bitcoin address. Specifically, the sender includes a so-called OP_RETURN “message” in that transaction. This message consists of his throwaway private key, but encrypted using the receiver's public key, so no one but the receiver can decrypt it.

To receive this transaction, the receiver monitors the blockchain for OP_RETURN transactions and tries to decrypt all of them. Once he finds a decryptable OP-RETURN message, he also finds the throwaway stealth private key to combine with his own stealth private key, with which he can generate the Bitcoin private key to spend the bitcoins in that transaction.

The receiver will have received a secure payment on an address he didn't even own until the actual payment was made. Meanwhile, the outside world might not even know it was a Stealth Transaction; all they see is a normal Bitcoin-transaction with an undecipherable OP_RETURN message attached.

Reusable Payment Codes

While Stealth Transactions offer a novel solution, the requirement to monitor the blockchain for OP_RETURN transactions do limit their potential. Specifically, light wallets typically don't store the entire blockchain and are, therefore, unable to receive Stealth Transactions. (DarkWallet, the only wallet that allows for Stealth Transactions so far, “outsources” this task to a server, which is not ideal for privacy.)

Reusable Payment Codes, introduced by Bitcoin developer Justus Ranvier in late 2015, are designed to solve this problem. They use another Bitcoin innovation designed by Bitcoin Core developer Dr. Pieter Wuille: The Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) key creation and transfer protocol. In short, this protocol allows for the creation of a series of seemingly independent Bitcoin private keys and addresses from a single seed.

With Reusable Payment Codes, the sender sends a so-called “extended public key” to the receiver through an otherwise normal transaction. With this extended public key and the (“stealth”) public key as published by the receiver, the sender is able to generate a series of Bitcoin addresses to send bitcoins to. The receiver, meanwhile, can use this extended public key to combine it with his own (“stealth”) private key to generate the corresponding Bitcoin private keys.

As such, the sender can send an almost unlimited amount of transactions to the receiver, to addresses that can only be “linked together” by the sender and the receiver. Onlookers will see normal Bitcoin transactions ‒ not knowing they all go to the same receiver; all while the receiver hasn’t published any of them anywhere.

However, since light wallets don’t monitor the blockchain, the initial “notification” transaction to serve as a “piggy back” for the seed-data is recognizable, as such, to the outside world. This might reveal who is transacting if the addresses can be linked to real-world identities. Even then, it would reveal only who is transacting; not how much or on which subsequent addresses.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.0772

Elliptic, a blockchain security and compliance company established in London in 2013, strives to be  “the global standard for blockchain intelligence” by transferring the rigorous security and compliance standards of traditional finance to the world of digital currencies. “We identify illicit activity on the Bitcoin blockchain and provide actionable intelligence to financial institutions and law enforcement agencies.” In July, for example, Elliptic and the Internet Watch Foundation announced a partnership to monitor and report Bitcoin transactions related to child pornography.

LexisNexis Risk Solutions, part of RELX Group, combines cutting-edge technology, data and advanced analytics to provide information that helps customers across industries and government predict, assess and manage risk. It is used by one hundred of the top U.S. banks and the firm also works with eighty percent of U.S. federal agencies, assisting with regulatory compliance and mitigating business risk, such as identity fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion, International Business Times reports.

“This alliance demonstrates how data, technology and analytics can be used in innovative ways to foster financial transparency from China to Germany to the U.S.,” said Thomas C. Brown, senior vice president of U.S. Commercial Markets and Global Market Development at LexisNexis Risk Solutions.

“More banks, Fintech startups, payments companies and eCommerce businesses can further consider the usefulness of the permissionless blockchain because as of today they are able to deploy best-of-breed money laundering screening against Bitcoin. As a result, the virtual currency potential evolves to a new level — from possible conduit for money laundering to trusted technology along the economic value chain.”

Detecting money laundering is complicated because, of course, those who engage in illicit activities put all sorts of smokescreens in place and often have enough money to spend on counter-detection measures. For example, according to data provided by Elliptic, the largest dark marketplaces facilitate more than $250 million in annual sales.

“For the first time, Bitcoin companies can leverage bank-grade risk management practices to identify Bitcoin entities that appear on sanction and watch lists from around the world,” said Dr. James Smith, Elliptic CEO and co-founder. “Having this enriched data set built natively into Elliptic’s products takes Bitcoin AML and KYC controls to the next level.”

Smith added that leading Bitcoin companies globally are using Elliptic products to assess risk on more than $1 billion in Bitcoin transactions each month. “By integrating LexisNexis Risk Solutions’ robust watchlist data, we are making it safe for a new wave of financial institutions to handle Bitcoin and bank Bitcoin companies,” he said.

Its new partnership with LexisNexis has created a service to bring bank-grade anti-money laundering (AML) controls to Bitcoin transactions, making the virtual currency more attractive to those who might want to use it for legitimate transactions, Reuters reports.

According to both companies, Bitcoin operators need to demonstrate strict compliance with AML and KYC (know your customer) if they want to be taken seriously in the financial world at large, and therefore the new monitoring solution can help in mainstreaming the emerging distributed ledger economy. However, it’s to be expected that those who want to escape detection — not always for illicit reasons — will increasingly resort to non-Bitcoin alternatives able to provide enhanced privacy.

In June 2015 Bitcoin Magazine covered the launch of “The Bitcoin Big Bang,” an interactive visualization that plots the emergence and interconnectivity of the key players in Bitcoin since its genesis in 2009. It was described as a breakthrough in Bitcoin transaction monitoring and compliance. According to the company, monitoring and compliance services help digital currency businesses to gain credibility and establish good relations with banks and mainstream financial operators.

Of course, operators such as Elliptic and Chainalysis, a Swiss company that provides similar services, are often criticized by parts of the Bitcoin community, especially libertarian early adopters. However, it seems likely that monitoring and compliance services are here to stay and grow.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.9882
2016/8/8,"After the Bitfinex Hack, Here’s Why Bitstamp Is Sticking With BitGo","In the aftermath of the recent theft of more than $65 million worth of bitcoins from Bitfinex, parts of the Bitcoin community have been wondering what role BitGo’s multisig-focused security offering may have played in the whole ordeal.

According to the company’s website, BitGo handles more than 10,000 Bitcoin transactions per day and helps its users transfer more than $1 billion worth of value per month. Many exchanges, such as Bitstamp and Kraken, use BitGo’s services.

Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Bitstamp Head of Business Development Vasja Zupan to get the exchange’s thoughts on BitGo in light of the recent hack.

Sticking with BitGo

When asked whether Bitstamp has had any second thoughts about its use of BitGo’s multisig architecture, Zupan was quick to come to the blockchain security company’s defense. “For now, Bitstamp does not see any reason for second thoughts about using BitGo’s technology,” he said. “We believe that proper implementation, regular audits, and overall strong security policies make all the difference.”

Zupan went on to point out that Bitstamp was the first exchange to implement the combination of cold storage with a multisig hot wallet. “We are confident in our system,” he added.

Differences with the Bitfinex Setup

While some traders may be concerned Bitstamp is using the same security offering used by Bitfinex during the hack, Zupan attempted to ease these worries by pointing out that Bitstamp’s multisig implementation is “fundamentally different from that of Bitfinex.”

“Bitstamp uses BitGo exclusively for its hot wallet, where only a small amount of bitcoins are kept (below 2 percent),” Zupan continued. “The vast majority of our bitcoins are stored offline in cold storage.”

Bitstamp was the victim of a hack in January of 2015. More than $5 million worth of bitcoin were stolen in the theft. The good news was that, unlike Bitfinex, the vast majority of Bitstamp’s funds were held in cold storage. Ironically, it was this hack that prompted Bitstamp to partner with BitGo for its multisig security offering.

Zupan also discussed other aspects of how his company’s exchange is structured to reassure traders that its system is secure.

“Aware that monitoring is crucial in the industry, we are the first virtual currency exchange to get formal oversight in place,” he said. “A key component of this is our recently acquired licence, which requires constant external financial audits, code reviews and penetration tests, examinations and the regular reporting of our financial balances. This provides the security our users require.”

“In our view, this unfortunate incident only serves to further confirm the importance of compliance, corporate governance, regulatory monitoring and auditing for virtual currency services,” Zupan added. “We, of course, hope that this issue will be resolved quickly and with a positive outcome for Bitfinex and its customers.”

Reasoning Behind Bitfinex’s Storage Setup

One of the main questions being asked of Bitfinex in the aftermath of the hack is why it decided to eliminate the cold storage aspect of its storage setup. This question was at least partially answered by Bitfinex’s Zane Tackett on the Whalepool Teamspeak server over the weekend.

“There were a lot of reasons for why we went with this implementation with BitGo; one, a big one, was transparency,” said Tackett. “Everyone has their own wallet that they can watch on the blockchain. They can see their bitcoin at any time, and we settle it once per day.”

Tackett argued that since Bitfinex offers such a high level of transparency, it is unable to cover things up when funds are lost or stolen. The details of how the exchange will secure its bitcoins in the future are unknown at this time.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.985
2016/8/25,Sandia National Laboratories Joins the War on Bitcoin Anonymity,"The Sandia National Laboratories, a major United States Department of Energy research and development facility, with campuses in Albuquerque, New Mexico and Livermore, California, managed and operated by the Sandia Corporation (a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin), is joining the war on Bitcoin anonymity.

Sandia researchers have created a set of requirements for an analysis tool that can be used to fight the use of bitcoin by criminals. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology (S&T) directorate requested that Sandia set up a graphical user interface or a front end on the Sandia research environment so DHS agents can test the algorithms Sandia is using in actual investigations. The result of Sandia’s work could eventually be delivered to other federal law enforcement agencies.

It’s worth noting that Sandia, adopting a position that is now becoming widespread among financial operators, institutions and administrations, is persuaded that Bitcoin is here to stay and is poised to have a disruptive but positive impact on the economy. The problem is that the potential for anonymity offered by Bitcoin has been and continues to be exploited by criminals to escape detection.

“In many ways, figuring out how to effectively combat illicit Bitcoin commerce and reduce its perception as a tool of criminals can encourage more people and companies to adopt Bitcoin for legitimate purposes,” said Sandia researcher, Andrew Cox, who is leading the project.

“Our job was to understand how Bitcoin works,” added Cox. “Bitcoin is a new, semi-anonymous currency that holds the potential to change the way all sorts of transactions work in a way that might really benefit the economy. Some of the potential benefits include making monetary transactions much more efficient and thereby driving down the costs of doing business, making transaction histories more transparent, which could help both financial markets and financial regulation and, depending on who you ask, reducing the risks associated with inflation and reliance on centralized monetary institutions. All that being said, it has been clear that criminals have been pioneers in using Bitcoin. They use it for drugs, for guns, child pornography and all sorts of terrible stuff.”

A solution is abandoning Bitcoin and re-using specific aspects of its underlying blockchain technologies to create non-anonymous digital currencies with some of the other desired features of Bitcoin — cheap transactions permanently recorded in a tamper-proof ledger. This is the approach followed by “permissioned blockchains” and current plans for central bank issued digital currencies.

However, it’s not certain that a permissioned, centrally controlled blockchain could leverage the network effect that powers Bitcoin. Legendary cryptographer Nick Szabo and other experts are persuaded that banks should embrace the crowd-sourced power and resiliency of permissionless blockchains like Bitcoin.

Another solution is to de-anonymize bitcoin transactions with blockchain network analysis tools such as those developed by companies like Elliptic and Chainalysis. In fact, bitcoin transactions are not anonymous. The full transaction history of any bitcoin address, including every transaction associated with that address, is permanently recorded in the tamper-proof public blockchain and is open to analysis. The illusion of anonymity stems from the pseudonymous nature of bitcoin addresses, which are not explicitly associated with their owners, although blockchain network analysis can often de-anonymize bitcoin users. This is Sandia’s approach.

According to Cox, there is no “silver bullet” algorithm to effectively de-anonymize Bitcoin. To do so would involve cross-referencing anonymous data with other, traditional sources of investigative data to identify suspects. “To be successful, the reality is it’s going to take different types of algorithms and additional types of investigative techniques including good old-fashioned police work,” said Cox. “They’re all going to have to be combined.”

The Sandia team set up a research testbed to experiment with algorithms that can de-anonymize illicit Bitcoin users, including a mix of traditional and novel investigative techniques. Of course, the criminals try to evade detection by using different bitcoin addresses, but the Sandia research results show that known methods often reveal that the same users are using the different Bitcoin addresses.

“It doesn’t mean that we get their actual names because there aren’t any names associated with Bitcoin,” said Cox. “But it will show that some transactions are controlled by the same user.” Then, when one of the transactions is de-anonymized and linked to a criminal, law enforcement will be able to refer back to the rest of the associated Bitcoin addresses they need to deal with. “Our clients are happy about the requirements we’ve developed and the research we’ve done on what types of tools and capabilities are needed,” concluded Cox.

The researchers are now in the process of generating their own methods by characterizing transactions of Bitcoin users and applying machine learning methods to uncover patterns of interest.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.5994
2016/8/26,Darknet Customers Are Demanding Bitcoin Alternative Monero,"The dark web has started to embrace Monero, a privacy-conscious alternative to Bitcoin.

First, the operators of SIGAINT, a commonly used dark web email provider, decided to host a full node for Monero light wallets. Then, an eight-month-old darknet market called Oasis decided to allow vendors to accept Monero. Finally, Alphabay, the largest darknet market in operation right now, announced the first phase of Monero implementation on their platform.

Why Monero?

Staff members at Alphabay and Oasis say that customers and vendors have simply demanded the Monero option. “It's a lot more secure than Bitcoin, especially when it comes to obfuscation,” said an anonymous member of the Alphabay support staff.

Although the darknet marketplaces tend to get negative press, the reality is that many of them bend over backwards for their customers; at least until they (some of them)  exit scam. “We have received a lot of requests about it; we've studied the cryptocurrency, and we've decided to implement it,” said an Oasis staff member. “This is what we do when users (both customers and vendors) suggest that we implement or change features. We love to hear back from everyone.”

The hidden service set up by the operators of SIGAINT acts in a manner similar to Electrum for those who are familiar with that particular Bitcoin wallet. The hidden service allows individuals to use lightweight Monero clients as opposed to running a full node on their own. When visiting the hidden service via the Tor Browser, information about Monero is shown, including the following message:

""The SIGAINT operators firmly believe that Monero is the next logical step in Darknet commerce. It solves most of the privacy problems that plague cryptocurrency systems such as Bitcoin.""

Bitsquare and ShapeShift.io appear to be the two options for obtaining Monero via Tor at the moment.

Why Not Dash or Zcash?

In addition to their reasons for supporting Monero, the SIGAINT operators have reasons not to prefer other options, such as Dash or Zcash. In the case of Dash, the site operators are wary of possible collusion by that digital currency’s supernodes. With Zcash, the operators are concerned about the company’s registration in the United States, the fact that mixing is done on an opt-in basis and the possibility of secret inflation initiated by the maintainers of the system.

The site operators also claim CoinJoin is not enough to maintain transaction unlinkability in Bitcoin. In a Reddit comment, Bitcoin Core contributor Luke-Jr seemed sympathetic to this viewpoint. “Only a fool would use Bitcoin as it is today for darknet,” he stated.

The staff members of Alphabay and Oasis seemed less inclined to talk about other privacy-centric digital currencies. “Haven't read about [them] yet,” said an Alphabay staff member when asked about Dash and Zcash.

One staff member from Oasis, which runs on donations, made it clear that they’re mainly interested in keeping their customers happy:

“Users requested the Monero implementation; we wouldn't have done anything without their request. There are tons of other cryptocurrencies out there and we obviously cannot implement them all. We will always be based first on our users’ feedback.”

What Does This Mean for Bitcoin?

Bitcoin’s main value proposition is as a fungible, bearer ecash that cannot be censored or tracked, but it’s unclear whether Monero will be able to chip away at the leading digital currency’s nearly $10 billion market cap. The price of Monero roughly doubled in the aftermath of these darknet announcements before coming back down to the 0.007 BTC area.

Although staff members from Alphabay and Oasis did not seem philosophically married to Bitcoin in their comments to Bitcoin Magazine, Monero faces many challenges on the road toward more widespread adoption on the dark web or as a store of value. Even Riccardo Spagni, a well-known Monero developer, does not tell people they should buy Monero. Instead, he views it as a place of experimentation for features that cannot currently be tested on Bitcoin. It’s possible that this sort of testing will take place on Bitcoin sidechains in the near future.

Even in a scenario where Monero gains traction on the dark web, it’s unclear if that would be enough for it to become a preferred store of value. Bitcoin still has a much longer track record and a much more liquid market, so it’s possible that darknet market customers and vendors will use Monero as an appcoin more than anything else, even if moving in and out of the Monero system would harm their privacy.

The push toward Monero on the dark web is a development worth watching, but it’s not the first time a darknet market has accepted an alternative, privacy-conscious digital currency. Two small markets accepted Dash (then called Darkcoin) in late 2014, but the altcoin was not able to gain any traction on the dark web. Time will tell if things will go differently for Monero.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.2263
2016/9/1,"How Bitcoin Users Reclaim Their Privacy Through Its Anonymous Sibling, Monero","Bitcoin right now is not really anonymous. While Bitcoin addresses aren't necessarily linked to real-world identities, they can be. Monitoring the unencrypted peer-to-peer network, analyses of the public blockchain and Know Your Customer (KYC) policy or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations can reveal a lot about who's using Bitcoin and for what.

This is not great from a privacy perspective. For example, Bitcoin users might not necessarily want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own; similarly, businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors.

Additionally, the fact that the transaction history of each bitcoin is traceable puts the fungibility of all bitcoins at risk. “Tainted” bitcoins, for example, may be valued less than other bitcoins, possibly even calling into question Bitcoin's value proposition as money.

There are potential solutions that may increase privacy and improve fungibility in Bitcoin. But most of these solutions are either partial, works-in-progress or just largely theoretical.

To reclaim their privacy right now, therefore, some bitcoiners have begun to utilize one of its competitors: the altcoin Monero.

The Bitcoin Scenario

Perhaps the main reason Bitcoin does not offer a whole lot of privacy is that different transactions are easily linked together.

This is because all Bitcoin transactions consist of inputs and outputs. Inputs refer to addresses bitcoins are sent “from” and outputs refer to addresses bitcoins are sent “to”. Naturally, then, outputs from one transaction become inputs in the next. The receiver of one output and the sender of the subsequent input are usually the same person.

Moreover, since most transactions are made by one person only, all input addresses typically belong to that same person as well. Meanwhile, that one person usually sends bitcoins to only one other person per transaction. That means that if there are two different outputs, one of these must be a change address, used by the sender to send excess bitcoins back to himself.

All these links in the chain make individual bitcoins traceable; it’s possible to determine in which transactions a certain bitcoin was previously used, thereby potentially harming fungibility and decreasing privacy, as all these links allow blockchain analysts to figure out which bitcoins likely belong(ed) to whom.

The Monero Scenario

As opposed to the majority of altcoins, Monero is not based on Bitcoin’s code-base or protocol. Instead, the cryptocurrency, launched in 2014, is based on the CryptoNote reference implementation, an altcoin that was designed from scratch.

Monero was created by the pseudonymous developer thankful for today, who was himself effectively “fired” by the community less than a month after Monero’s launch, as the project was forked away from him. It has since been led by a core team of seven developers, including Riccardo “fluffypony” Spagni and Francisco “ArticMine” Cabañas. Its native curreny, XMR, is one of the top altcoins by market cap, and is now accepted as payment on several dark net markets.

In Monero, the basic structure of Bitcoin transactions still holds up: each consists of inputs (“from”) and outputs (“to”). But there are two key differences. For one, outputs can only consist of rounded decimal numbers. So instead of an output worth 15.7 XMR, there will be three outputs, worth 10, 5 and 0.7 XMR. And the change outputs are also rounded. So if the input was worth, say, 60 XMR, the change outputs will be worth 40, 4 and 0.3 XMR for a combined output total of 60. Six outputs (40, 10, 5, 4, 0.7 and 0.3), where only the sender and receiver know which ones are payments and which are change. This already makes blockchain analysis a bit harder.

But this is really only the setup of the trick.

Ring signatures

The actual magic comes from a cryptographic signature scheme called “ring signatures,” based on the older concept of “group signatures.” Ring signatures exist as several iterations and variations, but all share the property of obfuscating which cryptographic key signed “which” message, while still proving “that” a cryptographic key signed “a” message. The version used by Monero is called “Traceable Ring Signatures,” invented by Eiichiro Fujisaki and Koutarou Suzuki.

Taking the example above, where an input worth 60 XMR was used to create six outputs, Monero utilizes ring signatures as follows.

The sender who created the 60 XMR input must have previously received these 60 XMR as an output of an earlier transaction. After all, he can only create a 60 XMR input if he controls a 60 XMR output first.

But with ring signatures, the sender can obfuscate “which” 60 XMR output he controlled. Instead, he can take several 60 XMR outputs from different transactions, and bundle them together in such a way that proves he owns “one” of these outputs — without revealing “which one”. And since Monero only works with round numbers, there should be plenty of 60 XMR outputs available on the blockchain to mix with.

As a result, Monero transactions are almost completely unlinkable. At best, blockchain-analysts can calculate the odds that transactions are linked, based on how many outputs were used in the mix to create an input. (This is configurable by the sender, with a minimum of three.)

And Back Again...

So how does any of this help Bitcoin or Bitcoin users?

Simple: Monero is used to “unlink” Bitcoin transactions in much the same way that Monero transactions are themselves unlinked.

Specifically, Bitcoin users sell bitcoin for XMR, ideally on a Tor-friendly exchange that does not require AML/KYC, like Shapeshift or Bitsquare. Later, they simply sell these XMR back for bitcoin on a different platform, which can also be done on XMR.to. If the buys and sells are spread over time a bit (since low transaction volume on Monero can be a slight giveaway in some cases), this leaves virtually no link on any blockchain at all.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.988
2016/9/28,Pamela Morgan on Security: “You Don’t Get to the Moon Without Blowing Up a Few Rockets”,"In what’s turning into the “year of the hack,” security issues are increasingly top of mind for those working in the Bitcoin and blockchain space.

Security expert Pamela Morgan is CEO of Third Key Solutions, attorney at Empowered Law PLLC, and board member of C4. She and her partners at Third Key Solutions, Andreas M. Antonopoulos (CTO) and Richard Kagan (Business Advisor), provide advice and security solutions for wallets, exchanges, crowd sales, and new innovative Bitcoin and blockchain projects.

Bitcoin and Blockchain ""More Secure Than Ever Before""

In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Pamela Morgan noted the contradiction that, despite recent events, Bitcoin and blockchain technologies may actually be more secure now than ever before:

“Bitcoin is more secure than it has ever been and it keeps getting stronger. The same is true for several other blockchains that increase their security as they mature and broaden their reach. But this is seemingly contradicted by frequent hacks affecting many users.”

“The contradiction lies in a subtle but important difference: Funds controlled directly by individuals in a decentralized manner and secured by decentralized blockchain protocols are extremely secure.”

“On the contrary, when a single entity concentrates control of funds from many individuals with custodial (aka hot) wallet accounts or poorly implemented large cold storage wallets, they become an extremely attractive target — a honeypot for attackers.”

Security Becomes an Important Priority for Ethereum

One such entity, the Ethereum DAO, suffered a cyber attack in June (losing one-third of its total funds) and the subsequent split into Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.

This tested Ethereum’s vulnerabilities and, among other measures, resulted in the hiring of Martin Holst Swende, a former NASDAQ information security specialist.

Swende will work with Ethereum Foundation-funded projects to enhance their security and will be responsible for Ethereum’s overall security during its ongoing development, working with smart contract developers and creating a special security website.

“Unintended Consequences Such as the Re-entrancy Bug”

We asked Morgan about her take on the unprecedented Ethereum DAO attack. She told us:

“Rapid and disruptive innovation is inherently risky. You don’t get to the moon without blowing up a few rockets and we won’t get to secure, large-scale smart contracts without blowing up a few DAOs. The same basic mantra of business applies here too — fail fast, fail cheap. The DAO achieved the former.”

“Writing smart contracts that control funds securely is difficult. Over time, the security-critical components will mature through many iterations and many losses. Even though the Ethereum platform is past its beta, every new smart contract and component should be treated as pre-alpha software.”

“Smart contracts need to mature and the Ethereum platform doesn’t magically make them robust. Both the platform and the contracts will mature through iteration together. The funds controlled by smart contracts should be proportional to their degree of maturity and testing.”

“Too much money was invested too quickly in an immature and overly complex contract. Complexity is the enemy of security. The flexibility introduced by a Turing complete, high-level smart contract language brings with it unintended consequences, such as the reentrancy bug that was introduced in the DAO contract.”

Bitfinex: One for the Books

The August hack of Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange Bitfinex, one of the top bitcoin traders globally, to the tune of roughly $70 million, sent a chill through the digital currency world and shook any complacency around the security of bitcoin exchanges.

Some experts have tied the hack to a shaky bitcoin price and wonder if it will take a while to restore confidence; others believe that Bitcoin’s security has been affirmed since Bitfinex was able to avoid a shutdown and Bitcoin's blockchain retained its security and functionality in spite of the hack.

In his response to the Bitfinex attack, Stefan Thomas, one of the original Bitcoin developers and Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer said, “There’s no history of how to write secure code. It is not surprising that it would be easy to miss typical problems.”

Morgan commented:

“The architecture of a bitcoin service provider, such as an exchange, holding funds for tens of thousands of users is inherently flawed. Re-centralizing data, in this case bitcoin keys, is the opposite of the decentralized architecture of Bitcoin itself.”

“Multisignature technology has been widely misunderstood as a security “fix” but multisig is simply a tool. Two entities controlling the keys and funds of 100,000 users is a bit better than one entity, but not as good as 100,000 points of control.”

“No one knows how to secure large concentrations of data. The data breaches of companies like Yahoo, Target, Best Buy and even the NSA demonstrate this point. The very same issues of scale apply to bitcoin data. The difference between a bitcoin theft and identity theft is that bitcoin users feel the sting immediately.”

Staying One Step Ahead of the Hack with Formal Verification

“Formal verification” is the new buzzword in the security business. Morgan thinks it is likely that eventually, “most smart contracts will incorporate formally verified components to build a strong foundation, and use more flexible coding practices for the rest of their contracts.”

“Formal verification is an interesting methodology that rebalances the tradeoff between flexibility and security,” she added. “Many programmers will find it difficult to write code that can be formally verified; but for core services, such as deciding who owns a contract and who controls funds (authentication, authorization, policy) formal verification could deliver much more secure code.”

“Decentralized Consensus is the Innovation that Matters.”

A number of developers have argued  that the security flaw in blockchain technology is its requirement to achieve distributed consensus on new security measures.

Updates to software in blockchain are inhibited because a majority who run the software must agree to the rollout.

However, Morgan takes a different view:

“We already have systems that are centralized, controllable and can be censored — like Ripple. They are not novel. They are not disruptive. They are business-as-usual with the word “blockchain” painted on as a thin veneer of innovation. Decentralized consensus is the innovation that matters.”

“Overall, I attribute the hacks in our industry as symptoms of growing pains in a fast moving space. Certainly some are caused by sloppiness, bad actors, and the re-introduction of centralization, but I believe most of it is simple human error in the face of unexplored territory and complexity. We simply don’t understand all the risks and there’s only one way to learn — real money, real risk, real people.”

“Eventually security functions smart contracts will be built by combining battle-hardened and mature modules for common functionality — much like cryptographic libraries and random number generators, people will not write their own. Until then, we try, we test, we fail and we try again. As these systems iterate and mature, they become more and more secure, more useful, and therefore more valuable.”",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.34
2016/10/25,"With TumbleBit, Bitcoin Mixing May Have Found Its Winning Answer","Bitcoin right now is not really anonymous. Monitoring the unencrypted peer-to-peer network, analyzing the public blockchain or Know Your Customer (KYC) policies and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations can reveal a lot about who is using Bitcoin and for what.

This is not great from a privacy perspective. For example, Bitcoin users might not necessarily want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own; similarly, businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors.

Additionally, the fact that the transaction history of each bitcoin is traceable puts the fungibility of all bitcoins at risk. “Tainted” bitcoins may be valued less than other bitcoins, possibly even calling into question Bitcoin's value proposition as money.

But privacy and fungibility can be improved. An older method to break a link of transactions — CoinSwap — was recently revived and improved upon, with promising results. TumbleBit, as the new solution is called, is set to realize a completely private and trustless mixing service — and even offers increased scalability as a bonus.

CoinSwap

A key problem for privacy and fungibility is that Bitcoin-addresses are trivially linkable. If Alice pays Bob a bitcoin, blockchain analysis reveals that their addresses did the transaction.

To break this link, Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell proposed CoinSwap, first introduced on the Bitcointalk forum in 2013.

The idea behind CoinSwap is very simple: it uses an intermediary for payment. If Alice pays one bitcoin to an intermediary, and this intermediary pays a different bitcoin to Bob, Alice will have effectively paid one bitcoin to Bob, but no link exists between their addresses on the blockchain.

The problem is that this intermediary can steal funds. If Alice pays the intermediary a bitcoin, the intermediary can simply decide not to pay Bob, and instead keep the bitcoin.

This is solved with Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs). Alice and the intermediary set up a special type of payment channel, while Bob and the intermediary set up a payment channel as well. Through clever Bitcoin tricks that include embedding dedicated cryptographic keys in transactions, these payment channels are effectively linked. Bob can claim one bitcoin from the payment channel between him and the intermediary, but only in such a way that the intermediary can also claim a bitcoin from the payment channel between him and Alice. No one can steal funds.

(The specifics of HTLC is beyond the scope of this article; for more details see ‘Understanding the Lightning Network, Part 2: Creating the Network’.)

CoinSwap breaks the link of transactions on the blockchain. But, unfortunately, that doesn’t solve all privacy and fungibility issues just yet. Most importantly, the intermediary still knows that Alice transacted with Bob. The intermediary can re-establish the link.

These issues are what the new TumbleBit improvement solves.

TumbleBit

TumbleBit was proposed by Boston University’s Ethan Heilman, Leen Alshenibr, Foteini Baldimtsi, Alessandra Scafuro and Sharon Goldberg last summer, and was recently presented at the Scaling Bitcoin workshops in Milan.

TumbleBit resembles CoinSwap, but adds three important features.

First, it adds anonymity in numbers. TumbleBit allows many users —  many “Alices” and many “Bobs” —  to set up payment channels with the same intermediary. And all Alices can send bitcoins to all Bobs through that intermediary.

Second, the payment channels between the intermediary and all Bobs are replaced by sophisticated cryptographic puzzles. If Bob can provide the solution to the puzzles, he can claim —  say — a bitcoin. The trick is that Alice buys the answers for these puzzles from the intermediary for a bitcoin. She then sends the answer to Bob as payment, which Bob will happily accept since he can claim a bitcoin with it.

And importantly: all this is done through several layers of cryptography. This ensures that the intermediary does not know which solution he sold to which Alice, nor do the Alices know which puzzle solution they gave to Bob. As such, once the Bobs claim their bitcoins, the intermediary sees that puzzles are solved. But due to the anonimity in numbers, the intermediary cannot link any of the Alices to any of the Bobs.

And third, the Alices and Bobs can fund their payment channels with the intermediary such that they can make several payments. And again, any Alice can pay any Bob; it doesn’t need to be the same Bob each time. This makes the intermediary a useful payment hub.

Furthermore, these puzzle-solving transactions between all Alices, the intermediary, and all Bobs, never hit the blockchain. Rather, once everyone is done transacting, the end-state of all payment channels is recorded on the blockchain once, to let everyone take their funds out. TumbleBit is a scalable second-layer payment hub on top of a privacy-friendly solution.

Reality

Last but not least: TumbleBit can be realized without requiring any changes to the Bitcoin protocol.

The team from Boston University has already coded a proof of concept and run successful tests on the blockchain. While the software is not quite ready for production use yet, it is open source and free for anyone to use and contribute to.

Furthermore, TumbleBit really only requires a single party to establish the service. In fact, it would be better if only one (or very few) parties offer it: if everyone uses the same TumbleBit service, that one service offers great anonymity in numbers. (Since it’s completely trustless, centralization is not an issue.)

And since fees are trivially implemented in the design, moreover, there is even an incentive to establish a TumbleBit server. It seems it’s only a matter of time before someone realizes this potential.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.5267
2016/12/19,How the Lightning Network Layers Privacy on Top of Bitcoin,"Bitcoin right now is not really anonymous. Monitoring of the unencrypted peer-to-peer network and analysis of the public blockchain, combined with Know Your Customer (KYC) policies and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulation, can reveal a lot about who is using Bitcoin and for what.

This is not great from a privacy perspective. For example, Bitcoin users might not necessarily want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own; similarly, businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors.

And the fact that the transaction history of each bitcoin is traceable puts the fungibility of all bitcoins at risk. “Tainted” bitcoins may be valued less than other bitcoins, possibly even calling into question bitcoin's value proposition as money.

But this can be improved. Perhaps one of the most promising solutions is designed to be an integral part of one of Bitcoin’s highly anticipated scaling layers: the lightning network. Utilizing the “Sphinx” protocol, lightning payments will be routed over a Tor-like anonymity network to offer privacy and protect fungibility.

Payment Channels and the Lightning Network: A Brief Recap

The lightning network essentially consists of bi-directional payment channels, creating a peer-to-peer network.

Bi-directional payment channels increase privacy even without the lightning network. Two users — let’s say Alice and Bob — can open a bi-directional payment channel and transact over this channel through a private medium. Only once they are finished transacting will they broadcast the final state of the channel to the blockchain. This public transaction reveals how much money Alice sent to Bob — or the other way around. But there is no way to tell whether this was through ten transactions, a hundred small transactions, or maybe even a thousand transactions back and forth. This ambiguity is a boon for privacy.

Unfortunately, a disadvantage is introduced when these bi-directional payment channels are all linked to create a peer-to-peer network. If Alice pays a third user — Carol — through Bob, Bob will know that Alice paid Carol, and how much. While Alice and Carol still have relative privacy in relation to the rest of the world, they do not have privacy in relation to Bob. And if there are two or more intermediaries —  not only Bob but also Dan — both Bob and Dan learn about the transaction between Alice and Carol.

Not ideal.

Sphinx

The current lightning network specification includes a solution to mask routing data from all intermediaries, based on Sphinx.

Designed by academic researchers, George Danezis and Ian Goldberg, Sphinx is a protocol to relay anonymized messages over a peer-to-peer network. The solution was first proposed in May 2009, and had nothing to do with the lightning network or even Bitcoin. It was Lightning Labs’ Olaoluwa Osuntokun who realized Sphinx could be utilized and, in collaboration with Blockstream’s Christian Decker, modified the protocol to better fit the lightning network.

Sphinx shares similarities with the well-known anonymizing communication tool, Tor (the Onion Router). As with Tor, any data package sent with Sphinx — including the receiving IP address – is encrypted. This encrypted package is then itself encrypted a couple times over until it consists of several “layers” of encryption (hence the “onion” metaphor for Tor).

Using clever cryptographic tricks, all these layers of encryption are applied so that each intermediary along a route toward the final destination of the package can unwrap only one layer. This layer reveals to each intermediary where the package must be forwarded to, but nothing else. (Compared to Tor, Sphinx uses improved cryptographic algorithms and creates a constant-size data package to better obfuscate a node’s position in the route.)

On lightning, the payer determines a path over the peer-to-peer network and wraps a payment package in layers of encryption. And, apart from just relay information, each intermediary also unpacks some additional data. This includes amounts, fees and more, along with allowing all intermediaries to set up a step in the payment chain. (In a future version of the lightning network, this may be extended with a protocol called “Hornet” to further streamline the whole process — but this is not strictly needed for the lightning network to function.)

Importantly, all intermediaries only learn from which channel they receive bitcoins, and to which channel they must forward the payment. The intermediaries have no idea whether they are the first step in the chain, the last step, a step somewhere in the middle, or perhaps even the only step. Whoever originally sent the transaction, and the one who ultimately receives it, remain known to only the sender and the receiver.

Whenever channels close, the advantages offered by bi-directional payments channels are clear — on steroids. While everyone gets to see how many bitcoins Alice sent to Bob over the duration of the channel, again, it remains unknown whether these were ten transactions, a hundred small transactions, or maybe even a thousand transactions back and forth. Moreover, Alice may not even have sent much of the money to Bob at all: perhaps most payments from Alice to Bob were actually routed to Carol, or to someone else, anywhere on the network.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.2023
2016/12/21,"AlphaBay Comments on Bitcoin Congestion, Monero Adoption and Zcash Possibilities","While Silk Road popularized the industry back in 2011, AlphaBay is the now the most widely used darknet market in existence. Usage statistics are hard to come by when it comes to Tor hidden services, but in an interview with Deep Dot Web earlier this year, the site’s head administrator claimed many vendors from the now-defunct Evolution marketplace have moved over to AlphaBay.

The popularity of AlphaBay is also obvious on the darknet markets subreddit, a popular forum of choice for those who shop on the darknet.

Bitcoin Magazine reached out to AlphaBay to get their thoughts on Bitcoin scaling and two privacy-focused altcoins: Monero and Zcash.

On Bitcoin Congestion

Many Bitcoin-related companies have had to deal with an increase in support tickets due to the increased congestion on the network this past year, and AlphaBay has not been spared this headache. “It has become an issue when there is [a] backlog on the blockchain, as many newbie users complain about missing deposits while they are in fact unconfirmed,” a member of the AlphaBay support team told Bitcoin Magazine.

Although various improvements to privacy and scalability were discussed at a Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Milan this past October, AlphaBay does not currently have any plans to run a Tumblebit hub or a Lightning Network node. “We have our own proprietary tumbling platform,” said the support representative.

It should be noted that the code for these projects are still works in progress. While the upcoming social media app Yours has implemented their own micropayments solution, a more elegant version of the Lightning Network will be possible if or when Segregated Witness is activated on the network. Tumblebit does not require any changes to the Bitcoin protocol, although it would be improved by Segregated Witness. At least two implementations are currently in development.

Are AlphaBay Users Paying with Monero?

After AlphaBay and Oasis (another darknet market) integrated Monero payments in late August, the market cap of Monero grew from around $25 million to over $170 million in a couple of weeks. The market cap has now settled around $110 million.

While Oasis appears to have pulled an exit scam (they ran away with users’ money) since their Monero announcement, AlphaBay is still alive and kicking. An AlphaBay support representative told Bitcoin Magazine that Monero accounts for 2 percent of AlphaBay’s business.

According to MoneroStats, there were less than 500 transactions per day on the Monero network before the darknet markets took an interest in the Bitcoin alternative. Now, there is usually three times that amount. It’s unclear how much of that transaction growth is due to real usage and how much is an increased number of speculators moving their coins between exchanges.

Zcash Worth Consideration

Zcash has launched since AlphaBay adopted Monero, and many are wondering if this could be the next altcoin tested out by the darknet markets. The Zcash market cap is currently less than a tenth of Monero’s.

When asked whether AlphaBay will adopt Zcash, a support representative told Bitcoin Magazine, “In the future we might. It looks like a good alternative.”",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.9964
2017/1/4,ValueShuffle Brings Together the Best of Both Worlds for Privacy,"In the quest for privacy and fungibility in Bitcoin, two researchers (from Saarland University in Saarbrücken, Germany and Indiana’s Purdue University) presented a promising privacy enhancement proposal last week. ValueShuffle, as the protocol is called, describes a method to mix bitcoins and at the same time hide the amounts involved in the mixing process.

It’s a potent combination, as Tim Ruffing, one of the researchers, explained:

“The combination of these two privacy-enhancing technologies, while not requiring any trusted third party, is what makes ValueShuffle unique.”

CoinJoin and CoinShuffle

Ruffing wrote the ValueShuffle draft white paper with Pedro Moreno-Sanchez; these are the same two researchers who previously proposed the CoinShuffle protocols, along with their PhD advisor, Aniket Kate, then at Saarland University.

Leveraging CoinJoin, first proposed by Bitcoin Core and Blockstream developer, Gregory Maxwell, CoinShuffle is a method to merge several transactions into one, with no need for a trusted party. As such, a single Bitcoin transaction can send bitcoins from many people to many people. This potentially obfuscates the trail of coins, as it’s no longer clear exactly who paid whom.

The obfuscation is only potential, however, because the amount of coins involved in a transaction can be a giveaway. If one transaction sends five bitcoins from address to address, and another transaction sends seven bitcoins from address to address, merging these into one transaction would not obfuscate much. Simply matching the amounts reveals who sent bitcoins to whom.

“With our initial CoinShuffle proposals, this can be solved if everyone uses the same amounts,” Ruffing explained. “If everyone involved in the mix sends exactly one bitcoin, the sending and receiving addresses can no longer be matched. But this is also quite a limiting factor. Any remaining coins must go to some change address without being anonymized, which is cumbersome, and may even break privacy if not used properly. And for technical reasons it also means you cannot use CoinShuffle to make a payment directly; you can only send bitcoins back to yourself.”

Confidential Transactions

With ValueShuffle, the problem of matching amounts is solved by hiding the amounts involved in a transaction.

This is accomplished using another proposal designed to increase privacy in Bitcoin: Confidential Transactions. Developed by Blockstream, Confidential Transactions is currently implemented in Blockstream’s Elements Alpha sidechain, which is active on Bitcoin’s testnet.

Using clever cryptography, Confidential Transactions ensures that no one can see how many bitcoins are involved in a transaction, nor how many were sent from which address to which address. Nodes can, however, verify that the total number of bitcoins sent matches the total number of bitcoins received. As such, they can be sure no bitcoins were created out of thin air.

The combination of CoinJoin and Confidential Transactions has long been considered a powerful solution. As CoinJoin obfuscates which addresses sent bitcoins to which addresses, Confidential Transactions obfuscates the amounts, to break all links. With ValueShuffle, all this can be done without requiring a trusted party to merge the different transactions into one.

“Plus, it allows users to make payments directly through ValueShuffle, rather than having to send themselves mixed bitcoins first,” Ruffing said.

Segregated Witness

Thus far, however, the Confidential Transactions building block is not part of the Bitcoin protocol.

“But it may be in the future,” Ruffing said. “It can be rolled out with a backward compatible soft fork, which would be even easier if Segregated Witness is activated first. On top of that, ValueShuffle could benefit from Segregated Witness in other ways. Since Confidential Transactions are relatively expensive compared to normal transactions, the witness “discount” will help. And if Schnorr signature aggregation is deployed through Segregated Witness as well, that would be another boon for efficiency.”

If Confidential Transactions does become part of the Bitcoin protocol — either through Segregated Witness or as an independent soft or hard fork — not much stands in the way of ValueShuffle. The solution would not require additional protocol changes; it would just require wallets to implement the solution. And, ideally, a server to host the mixing protocol.

“Technically, it can be done without a central server, but it wouldn’t be very practical. And keep in mind that a central server wouldn’t need to be trusted with users’ private keys or privacy, and they’re easily replaced if something goes wrong.” Ruffing said. “As for wallets, Mycelium has already implemented a version of CoinShuffle. And ValueShuffle is even easier to implement, because it’s based on the simpler and more efficient CoinShuffle++ protocol.”",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.6369
2017/2/8,Darknet Markets Causing Trouble for US Postal Service,"It appears the United States Postal Service is determined not to be the courier of choice for drug dealers any longer.

Judging by a recent job listing sent to the information security community, the United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) — the law enforcement arm of the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) — wants to sniff out users of darknet markets that send their packages by mail. 

Applicants for the job, listed as “Investigative (Internet) Analyst”, are expected to know their way around bitcoin — the currency of choice on the darkweb — a as well as other tools typically used by darknets, like Tor.

Although the job listing doesn’t appear to be published online any more, according to Deep Dot Web the USPIS is specifically looking for applicants able to unmask pseudonymous users of dark net markets:

“Candidates shall be capable of performing a prioritized assessment of the data to identify the most critical and reliable data in order to identify bitcoins, locations, accounts, services, travels, email addresses, IP addresses and other pattern of life data in an effort to determine physical attribution of an Internet identity.”

And, according to Motherboard:

“The analyst shall be capable to use technology solutions to actively search, analyze and prioritize the various market places and cyber-criminals to identify high value targets for the USPIS investigators.”

Darknet Going Forward
Darknet markets are eBay-like market places that operate on darknets such as Tor and I2P, most commonly operating as digital black markets. The vast majority of purchases are illegal drugs, but weapons, stolen credit card details and other illegal goods are traded as well. 

Since pioneering darknet market Silk Road was closed down in 2013, and founder Ross Ulbricht sentenced to life in prison, buying and selling of illegal contraband has only increased.

Shipment of the illegal goods is exclusively done by mail. In most cases, at least in the United Stated, this is done with USPS. As a federal agency, USPS is bound by the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution. This prevents the postal service from inspecting packages without a warrant, attaining which in turn requires probable cause. Providing this probable cause is — presumably — where the investigative analyst would come in.

That said, even now, the mailing system is probably the weakest link in darknet market operations. Where online communication is protected with encryption and Tor, and bitcoin (or monero) payments can be mixed and tumbled, packages still require physical addresses — and can be intercepted.

Indeed, the USPIS does already regularly provide assistance in darknet investigations. Perhaps most notably,  the USPIS is said to have played an active role November 2016's ""Operation Hyperion,” one of the most extensive police operations focused on the darknet to date, where thousands of users of these marketplaces were identified.

The job listing suggests the USPIS will ramp of these and similar efforts in the future.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.4019
2017/2/24,Using a Bitcoin Service? You May Need to Change Your Password (Now),"Some of the most popular Bitcoin services on the internet may have leaked sensitive user information, including passwords.

Cloudflare is a popular content delivery network that effectively acts as a sort of digital shield, a proxy that offers millions of websites DoS protection and other services. Some of the biggest websites on the internet use Cloudflare, including several well-known Bitcoin companies, like Coinbase, Kraken, LocalBitcoins, Poloniex and more

Any data sent to and from these websites essentially passes through Cloudflare. This includes passwords, as well as cookies, authentication tokens and other sensitive information.

Last week, an exploit now known as “Cloudbleed” — a reference to the Heartbleed security bug — was discovered by Google Project Zero security researcher Tavis Ormandy. A major flaw in Cloudflare’s infrastructure, caused by what is known as a “buffer overflow,” basically spilled data all across the internet. Whenever anyone requested data from a particular website or mobile app protected by Cloudflare, Cloudflare could randomly send data from completely different websites along with it.

“We fetched a few live samples, and we observed encryption keys, cookies, passwords, chunks of POST data and even HTTPS requests for other major Cloudflare-hosted sites from other users,” Ormandy wrote in his blog entry.

The vulnerability is significant in scope as well as length. It could have been exploited anytime between September 22 and February 20, while the period of greatest impact was between February 13 and 18. And as a potentially bigger concern, some search engines may have even cached the sensitive data as well, meaning it’s publicly available to anyone.

The good news is that the odds of sensitive data falling into the wrong hands so far seems relatively small. “We have also not discovered any evidence of malicious exploits of the bug or other reports of its existence,” Cloudflare itself wrote in their incident report.

However, the bad news is that there is no way of knowing exactly what data may have leaked. Users of services that may have been impacted, therefore, should assume their data is no longer secure and change their passwords immediately. (This of course also includes passwords on non-Cloudflare websites that have been used across multiple sites.)

It seems less likely that accounts protected with two-factor authentication are vulnerable, though it may depend on the specific implementation; resetting it is still advisable. Those that use API keys should be reset too.

Cloudflare has since patched the bug, and some search engines (like Google) are removing any such data from their caches that they can find.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.9183
2017/3/10,Bitcoin Privacy for All: Breeze Wallet Is About to Bring TumbleBit to Life,"TumbleBit, one of the most promising privacy advancements built on top of Bitcoin, will be implemented in the upcoming Breeze Wallet.

The Breeze Wallet is a bitcoin wallet in development by blockchain startup Stratis, scheduled for release in one or two months. It will serve as a typical bitcoin wallet for desktop computers, but with an added tumbling option. Connected through a TumbleBit tumbler, Breeze Wallet users can mix their coins without needing to trust each other or the tumbler with their coins or their privacy.

“We are integrating TumbleBit because it’s a trustless and secure solution that works with Bitcoin without any forks,” Stratis Founder and CEO Chris Trew told Bitcoin Magazine.

Stratis

Stratis is a U.K.-based startup that offers end-to-end solutions for development, testing and deployment of blockchain applications. The company will maintain its own blockchain (the Stratis blockchain), which includes a native token (the Stratis token). Additionally, the company builds tools for existing blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum and BitShares. Stratis projects include a Bitcoin full node in the programming language C#, a Bitcoin software development kit and, indeed, the Breeze wallet, which will hold both bitcoins and the Stratis tokens.

TumbleBit was first proposed by academic researchers Ethan Heilman, Leen AlShenibr, Foteini Baldimtsi, Alessandra Scafuro and Sharon Goldberg. Inspired by its potential, “Programming The Blockchain in C#” author and Stratis team member Nicolas Dorier started working on an implementation of TumbleBit in C#. He was joined by the co-author of his book, Ficsór Ádám, who focused on Tor integration.

Now, with the help of Ádám, Stratis is making the solution available in a convenient and easy-to-use wallet. It is a natural match not only because Stratis’s and Dorier’s implementations of TumbleBit share the same programming language, but also because Stratis has a strong focus on privacy on their own platform, Trew explained.

“Regulation is one of the main hurdles for blockchain [technology] and Bitcoin adoption among the financial services industry,” he said. “The first step of regulatory compliance is privacy of their sensitive financial data. This is one of the reasons for the rise of the private chain and distributed ledger technologies. Our goal is to provide open and public blockchain solutions for the enterprise; to deliver this we must provide transaction privacy on a public blockchain.”

Challenges

To realize the privacy features it promises, Breeze Wallet will also introduce a relatively new type of light client. Based on work by Bitcoin Core developer Jonas Schnelli, the wallet will utilize “Full Block Simplified Payment Verification,” or “Full Block SPV.”

Full nodes download and verify each block on the blockchain, which can be quite resource intensive. Most light clients therefore only download the specific data that’s relevant to them: mostly relating to their Bitcoin addresses. But to do this, they need to share all their addresses with a server or a node on the Bitcoin network.

This server or node — and anyone spying on the communication with this server or node — learns all addresses that are in the wallet. This makes tumbling coins from one address in a wallet to another address in the same wallet rather pointless.

Instead, Ádám is currently implementing a type of light client that will download full blocks but immediately discard any data it doesn’t need. This requires the wallet to download more data than typical light clients, which is why Breeze Wallet won’t be very suitable for mobile wallets anytime soon. But it will be less resource intensive than running a full node and, therefore, easier to use for regular users.

Lastly, one hurdle remains: someone, somewhere, needs to host the tumbler. While this can be done as a hidden service, the TumbleBit developers have been hesitant to do this themselves so far. Such a service may not exactly please regulators and anti-money laundering agencies.

Stratis is now working through the legal and regulatory issues involved with deploying a solution of this type. “The ultimate goal is to have a decentralized network of TumbleBit servers. We are working on delivering end-to-end solutions; then we will further develop some of the core components,” Trew said.

2017/3/15,This Security Researcher Found the Bug That Knocked Out Bitcoin Unlimited,"For over a year, attackers have had the ability to crash Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic nodes. Yesterday, someone actually did it. According to websites like Coin Dance, the number of Bitcoin Unlimited nodes fell sharply from almost 800 to less than 250 in a matter of hours. Bitcoin Classic was hit shortly after.

One day earlier, the security researcher who found the vulnerability had reached out to Bitcoin Magazine.

“I am quite beside myself at how a project that aims to power a $20 billion network can make beginner’s mistakes like this.”

The Vulnerabilities

Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic are forks of Bitcoin Core that intend to increase Bitcoin’s block size limit. Both launched in 2015 and have been maintained by their own development teams since. While Bitcoin Classic was a relatively popular alternative to Bitcoin Core last year, Bitcoin Unlimited has been gaining traction lately. The world’s largest mining pool — AntPool — announced it would switch to Bitcoin Unlimited, as have several smaller pools.

But not everyone believes that is a good idea.

“I am rather dismayed at the poor level of code quality in Bitcoin Unlimited and I suspect there [is] a raft of other issues,” a security researcher identifying herself only as “Charlotte Gardner” told Bitcoin Magazine on Monday.

Communicating over email, Gardner said she was auditing the software for her own use, but quickly came to the conclusion that it’s highly unsafe: “What concerns me is that this software is now being used by a huge portion of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem.”

Gardner revealed that she had submitted two vulnerabilities — “critical remote crash vulnerabilities” to be exact — to the Bitcoin Unlimited development team.

The first one is known as a “NULL pointer dereference,” the second a “reachable assertion.” In both cases, attackers can send especially crafted messages to Bitcoin Unlimited or Bitcoin Classic nodes to make these nodes crash. On an open peer-to-peer network like Bitcoin’s, this means that an attacker can get a list of Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic nodes from publicly available sources, like Bitnodes, and simply knock every single one of them offline.

“I’m surprised no one has noticed them yet,” Gardner told Bitcoin Magazine one day before the attack took place. “I guess not many people actually use the Bitcoin Unlimited software. But with their ‘rise,’ attackers may take more interest.”

The Disclosure

When contacting Bitcoin Magazine on Monday, Gardner did not immediately want to make the vulnerabilities public. That would have been irresponsible, she explained, as the bugs could still be exploited before the Bitcoin Unlimited development team had the chance to fix it.

But she did also submit the vulnerabilities to Mitre’s Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. This ensures that Mitre discloses the bugs in one month from now, which pressures the developers to actually fix the problem in time.

However, even following this responsible disclosure, Gardner thought there was a risk that the vulnerabilities would be abused as soon as they were fixed in the Bitcoin Unlimited code repository. After all, at that point the problem isn’t really solved: anyone running the released Bitcoin Unlimited software is still vulnerable until they download and run the new, revised version. This opens a window for attackers.

“The problem is, the bugs are so glaringly obvious that when fixing it, it will be easy to notice for anyone watching their development process,” she said.

It now appears that is exactly what has happened. While the Bitcoin Unlimited developers did indeed fix the issue shortly after it was pointed out to them, they did so with far too conspicuous a GitHub commit message, Gardner told Bitcoin Magazine once it appeared the bugs seemed fixed and before the attacks began.

“Their commit message does ring alarm bells. I’m not sure if anyone will notice, but they probably should have obfuscated the message a bit more. The wording might attract closer scrutiny. But if it went unnoticed for this long, maybe it will go unnoticed.”

Clearly, it did not.

As Gardner warned, it didn’t take long for attackers to exploit one of the vulnerabilities: the first attacks happened shortly after the bugs were fixed. A little later, user “shinobimonkey” took the issue to Reddit, Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd tweeted about the bug and social media blew up.

Someone then even published exploit code for anyone to use, and before long most Bitcoin Unlimited nodes were down, to be followed by many Bitcoin Classic nodes.

“This is exactly why there is supposed to be a ‘responsible disclosure’ protocol,” Gardner told Bitcoin Magazine after the attacks took place. “But then it doesn’t help if the software project is not discreet about fixing critical issues like this.”

Code Quality

This is not the first time the code quality of Bitcoin Unlimited or Bitcoin Classic has been scrutinized.

As the best-known example, the bitcoin.com mining pool, which runs Bitcoin Unlimited, mined an invalid block caused by a bug last January. All energy invested to produce the block was wasted, while mining pools that spy mined on top of the invalid block wasted some energy as well.

Before that, Bitcoin Core developers had already warned about buggy code on several occasions. On the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Matt Corallo said that he had found Bitcoin Classic’s flexible transactions codebase to be “riddled with blatant and massive security holes.” On Reddit, Gregory Maxwell pointed out that Bitcoin Unlimited nodes were crashing because the development team removed code that shouldn’t have been removed.

Addressing Bitcoin Unlimited lead developer Andrew Stone in response to yesterday’s events, Maxwell suggested there are more problems with Bitcoin Unlimited’s codebase that have not yet been abused:

“There are vulnerabilities in Unlimited which have been privately reported to you in Unlimited by Bitcoin Core folks which you have not acted on, sadly. More severe than this one, in fact.”

Perhaps the main problem for Bitcoin Unlimited, as pointed out by information security expert Andreas Antonopoulos, is that it lacks a significant development community to perform proper quality analysis. The number of developers working on Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic is relatively small, and the code that included the exploited vulnerability was merged after being reviewed by only one person — not a lot for security-critical code protecting people’s money.

Gardner agreed with this assessment:

“In this case, the vulnerabilities are so glaringly obvious, it is clear no one has audited their code because these stick out like a sore thumb,” she said. “I’m astounded the mining industry are running this software. But since they are, and a lot of people could get harmed, the best I can do, other than recommending they don’t use Bitcoin Unlimited, is to disclose the issues and hope they are competent enough to fix it.”

2017/4/9,A Beginners Guide to Surviving a Coin-split,"There is a chance Bitcoin will experience a coin-split soon. If a majority of miners (by hash power) switch to Bitcoin Unlimited and decide to mine blocks bigger than one megabyte, while at least some users stick to the current Bitcoin protocol, the network and blockchain can split in two. In that case, there may be two different types of Bitcoin tokens: “BTC,” which follows the current Bitcoin protocol, and “BTU,” which follows the new Bitcoin Unlimited protocol.

The good news is that each bitcoin would effectively be copied onto the Bitcoin Unlimited chain. If you hold bitcoin right now, you will hold both BTC and BTU after a split.

The bad news is that a coin-split can be messy and risky. This is mainly because, at first, all BTCs and all BTUs will be stuck together. You will need to separate them somehow; otherwise you can lose your BTC or your BTU.

This guide will provide you with the basics to stay safe during a coin-split, and make sure you make it to the “other side” with both your BTC and BTU intact.
Author’s note: If you want to play the BTC/BTU markets as soon as possible and you are fine with taking risks, and/or you really know what you are doing, this article is probably not for you. (Perhaps try this Electrum article instead.)

If you mostly just want to make sure not to lose your BTC or BTU, read on …


Before the Coin-Split (That’s Now)
First of all, be aware that a coin-split is a high-risk situation. There is a real chance a sort of cyber-battle will break out between the two camps, perhaps even escalating to the point where bitcoin’s exchange rate(s) drops sharply, possibly to zero. Make absolutely sure you are not holding more value in bitcoin than what you are willing to lose.

If you do decide to hold on to your bitcoins, the single most important piece of advice is this: control your own private keys.

If you are storing your bitcoins on an exchange, in a custodial wallet like Coinbase, Circle or Xapo, or on any other service that holds your private keys for you, you may or may not eventually receive coins on both ends of the chain. Several exchanges have so far suggested you may but have made no guarantees. And at least one exchange, GDAX, has explicitly indicated you may not.

Learn more about bitcoin wallets here. If you’re using any of these kinds of services to store your bitcoins, you need to create your own wallet. Send your bitcoins to this new wallet; this wallet now holds your private keys.

What kind of wallet you want to use is up to you. That said, here are some basic solutions:

If you don’t care about transacting with either BTC or BTU anytime soon, and really just want to keep both as a long-term investment, printing your private keys on a paper wallet is one option. This option, however, is only really secure if you follow strict security precautions, which you can find here.

Another option is to get a hardware wallet. Any of the hardware wallets listed on bitcoin.org will keep your private keys secure. One hardware wallet provider in particular, Trezor, has explicitly acknowledged that users will have access to their coins on both ends of the chain if a coin-split happens.

.Therefore, in terms of the security of your coins, a little has changed — no action is required from you & your coins remain safe. You will not magically lose coins because of a fork.” Trezor blog post, March 20]Regular wallets are about as secure as your computer (or phone) is. Since most computers and phones are not all that secure, these are not ideal for large amounts. With that in mind, all mobile wallets and desktop wallets listed on bitcoin.org will store your private keys for you. Additionally, a full node like Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots gives you a little extra security during a coin-split, as you’ll see below.

During the Coin-Split
The first thing to note is that Bitcoin Unlimited has not set a ""flag date"" to fork. This means that theoretically, a fork could happen at any time. Realistically, however, it will depend on miner coordination, and it will probably be obvious to even casual Bitcoin observers when a fork is close to happening.

If Bitcoin Unlimited does fork, things could get messy for anywhere between a couple of hours to a couple of days, or longer.

Unfortunately, Bitcoin Unlimited currently does not include “replay protection.” This means that post-fork, transactions on both sides of the fork will look identical. If a transaction is picked up by both networks — for example, because the receiver of a transaction re-transmits the transaction on the other network — that transaction may be valid on both chains. This is called a “replay attack.”

As such, spending coins on one end of the chain could make you accidentally spend the equivalent coin on the other side of the chain. Instead of paying someone only BTC, you may unintentionally send BTU as well — or vice versa. This is how the BTCs and BTUs are “stuck together.”

The best way to prevent replay attacks is simple: do not send any transactions. Not until it is clearer to everyone what the post-fork situation looks like.

If you use Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots as a wallet and you want to accept BTC, that should still be fine. (Someone who didn’t read this article may accidentally send you the equivalent in BTU, though. If this happens, you should probably return the funds later on.)

Bitcoin Unlimited, on the other hand, does not include “wipeout protection.” If the amount of mining power on the BTC chain ever overtakes the BTU chain, the entire BTU chain will be discarded (unless users on the BTU chain coordinate fast enough to prevent this in unconventional ways).

Unless and until it is absolutely clear that Bitcoin Unlimited emerges as a definitive winner forever, accepting any BTU is very risky, and you probably shouldn’t do it at all. After the Coin-Split
If both chains survive, and you control your private keys, you will have coins on both sides of the fork. But as mentioned, it will be tricky to spend coins on one chain without accidentally spending the equivalent on the other side.

Fortunately, there are ways to avoid these replay attacks. The most straightforward solution requires brand-new coins, mined after the split. These new coins are the only coins that do not exist on both chains and cannot, therefore, be spent on both. Combining these new coins with old coins effectively splits the BTC from BTU.

This coin-splitting can, and probably will, be a bit complex. But some exchanges will likely set up coin-splitting services and take care of most of the complexity behind the screens. You’d just need to send your bitcoins to an exchange, and the exchange will credit your account with BTC and BTU. (They should even replay the transaction for you, to make sure they indeed receive both your coins and can split them for you.) If you want, you can now also sell your BTU for BTC (or fiat currency), or the other way round.

There may also be other solutions to split your coins in the event of a coin-split, perhaps even trustless solutions. But that remains to be seen.

After the split, there will probably be wallets for both coins soon enough. Of course, you may need to upgrade your existing wallet or download a new wallet if and when this happens. This also remains to be seen. (Do not accept any transactions on your wallet before this is clear.)

Further specifics on what to do after a coin-split will be announced on Bitcoin Magazine (and most likely on bitcoin.org and other sources of information) if and when a coin-split occurs and we have a better understanding of the post-fork situation.

Oh, and when you, years from now, want to use the funds stored on your paper wallet, don’t forget you now own both BTC and BTU! (Wallets like Electrum and Blockchain allow you to upload the private keys, and you’ll probably need to go through the same splitting ceremony.)

If only one chain survives, operations should continue at some point. However, it’s not exactly clear what this post-fork landscape will look like. Perhaps you’ll have to upgrade your wallet. This will also be announced on Bitcoin Magazine if and when it comes to it.

If neither chain survives, the Bitcoin experiment has failed, and your private keys will probably be worthless.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.296
2017/4/10,"""Confidential Assets"" Brings Privacy to All Blockchain Assets: Blockstream","On a typical blockchain, all participants check all transactions. This level of transparency can offer much security, as public verification ensures no single participant can cheat any of the others. But it is not great for privacy.

For bitcoin (the currency), a potential solution to improve privacy is “Confidential Transactions.” Confidential Transactions hide the amounts of bitcoin that are transacted; they are currently used in test environments and in academia.

Today, Blockstream — the well-known tech company founded by several Bitcoin Core developers — unveiled “Confidential Assets.” Where Confidential Transactions is specifically designed for bitcoin, Confidential Assets brings a similar level of privacy to any type of blockchain asset, like ownership papers, stock or fiat currency IOUs.

“With Confidential Assets, we can generate multi-asset transactions where both the amount and the asset type itself are encrypted,” Blockstream Infrastructure Tech Engineer Gregory Sanders told Bitcoin Magazine.

Confidential Assets
Confidential Assets — in itself not an entirely new concept — increases privacy in two ways.

The first part of the puzzle is indeed based on Confidential Transactions, which was first proposed by hashcash inventor and current Blockstream CEO Dr. Adam Back. This was further developed by Bitcoin Core and Blockstream developers Gregory Maxwell and Dr. Pieter Wuille, and Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra, and then deployed on Blockstream’s Alpha sidechain.

With Confidential Transactions, only the sender and the receiver of a transaction know the amount that is involved in a specific transaction. A public verifier — that’s the rest of the world — knows that a transaction was made between the sender and receiver, but cannot tell how much was transacted: the amount is masked.

What’s clever about Confidential Transactions is that the amounts are masked in such a way that public verifiers can still perform certain types of math on them. More specifically, anyone can add up the amounts on the sending end of a transaction, and add up all of the amounts on the receiving end, and see if they cancel out. If they do cancel out, it means no value was created out of thin air. While public verifiers will never know how much was transacted, they do know the system wasn’t cheated; and that’s all they really care about.

The second part of the puzzle, which is new, extends a similar type of masking to the assets themselves. Instead of just bitcoins, Confidential Assets can be used for any digital, blockchain-based asset.

“While the sender and receiver would know that, say, a gold certificate was transacted, a public verifier would only know that ‘some asset’ was transacted — in ‘some amount,’” Sanders explained.

“And if multiple assets are transacted at once, the public verifier would see that multiple types of ‘some assets’ changed hands, and he can verify that no ‘some assets’ were created out of thin air. But he would still not know what was transacted exactly, or how much of each ‘some asset.’”

Projects
Confidential Assets may be deployed on two different projects relatively quickly.

For one, it can be combined with Blockstream’s existing sidechain, Liquid. This is a federated blockchain pegged to Bitcoin, where instead of miners, Bitcoin exchanges and other service providers confirm blocks. Compared to proof of work mining, this allows for instant transactions at low cost, without burdening Bitcoin’s main blockchain. Exchanges, in particular, can use this to let customers move bitcoins between accounts at different exchanges without having them wait for blockchain confirmations.

With Confidential Assets, this functionality can be extended to the fiat side of the equation, too. Rather than just bitcoins, exchanges and service providers could swap fiat currency instantly and privately, allowing their users to move U.S. dollars, euros or other currencies between accounts as well.

And second, Blockstream established a collaboration with Japanese IT company Digital Garage.

“Digital Garage is working on a loyalty points blockchain,” Sanders explained. “This means that all types of companies can issue their loyalty points, and customers can use them or trade them atomically for other assets using market makers. […] Privacy is huge here because you do not want to be showing the whole world how many points are outstanding on your books.”

Moreover, a Confidential Assets sidechain could realize a trustless, instant and private decentralized exchange.

As a simplified example, if Alice has a bitcoin but prefers a gold certificate, while Bob has a gold certificate but prefers a bitcoin, they can create a single CoinJoin transaction to realize the trade. Alice sends a bitcoin to Bob, while Bob sends a gold certificate to Alice; both only sign their end of the transaction if they agree.

This basic setup can be extended to intermediaries that act, themselves, as sort of liquidity providers or peer-to-peer exchanges.

“For the Digital Garage demo we have implemented a trustless, blinded swap of multiple assets through peers already. If we can deploy fiat currency on the blockchain, we can make similar arrangements between bitcoin and U.S. dollar, euro or yen,” Sanders said.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.34
2017/5/10,Deloitte's RegTech Offering: Blockchain-Powered KYC-as-a-Service Solution,"Global consultancy and accounting firm Deloitte announced that it has developed a new KYC-as-a-service solution using blockchain technology that will facilitate the customer onboarding process for financial institutions.

The proof of concept has been developed by the team headed up by Director and Blockchain Leader Thibault Chollet in Deloitte’s Luxembourg branch. The name of the new solution is KYCstart (pronounced “kickstart”). KYCstart creates digital identities for new customers that can then be used across different platforms and institutions, thereby making the customer onboarding process much more efficient while also reducing costs.

Currently, when a new customer is being onboarded by a financial institution, the process involves an employee of the compliance department electronically filling out KYC (Know Your Customer) forms, which include information such as place of incorporation, ownership structure, whether they are regulated or not, whether they have any legal proceedings against them, and what type of business will be conducted with them.

To gather this information, compliance officers will regularly need to reach out to the potential customer via email and phone as well as scroll through the regulator’s database to find any recorded wrongdoings and confirm the regulatory status of the customer.

Deloitte’s new proposed model of completing the onboarding process, however, involves regulated KYC added-value service providers, which are authorized to perform KYC checks for customers who would like to be onboarded by financial institutions, such as banks, insurance companies and investment management firms.  

Customers and clients could then control who their company information is being shared with and would be able to keep track of the authorizations using blockchain-based smart contracts.

“With this proof of concept and related ecosystem, we demonstrate the benefits of using blockchain [technology] and smart contract[s] to considerably reduce the costs of one of the most important burdens of our institutional clients: KYC and customer onboarding,” Chollet explained.

Blockchain Technology Is Making Waves in RegTech

RegTech (regulatory technology), a relatively new branch of financial technology, focuses on leveraging innovative new technologies to improve regulatory reporting and monitoring as well as compliance processes for financial institutions.

The financial industry is particularly keen on this subsector of fintech as financial regulations have tightened substantially since the 2008 global financial crisis, which has led banks to invest heavily in the areas of KYC/AML, compliance and risk management. Hence, any solution that will help banks to streamline their processes and reduce overheads will be very welcome by financial situations.

As Bitcoin Magazine reported in April, blockchain technology is making waves in RegTech. The integration of distributed ledger technology into compliance systems and processes could save financial institutions up to 50 percent in compliance costs, according to blockchain startup Coinfirm and management consulting firm Accenture.

Using blockchain technology, data security could be improved, manual processes could be digitized, customer onboarding documents could be verified for authenticity, the speed and accuracy of daily regulatory reporting to regulators could be increased, and digital identities could be created for companies, which can then be shared among permissioned financial institutions, as Deloitte’s new KYC-as-a-service product is aiming to do.

Deloitte plans to roll out its new KYC-as-a-service solution to financial institutions this summer, and the newly developed KYCstart will be one of the proposed onboarding channels for this service.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.3182
2017/5/19,How Blockchain Identity Trust Is Fostering New Applications in Healthcare,"Can identity trust be integrated with blockchain technology? The answer to that question appears to be yes, according to a recently completed proof-of-concept study conducted by Peer Ledger, a Canadian blockchain company; SAFE-BioPharma Association, the organization managing the global SAFE-BioPharma digital identity management standard; and Synchronoss, a leading provider of standards-based digital identities.

This development is believed to have significant implications for the use of distributed electronic ledgers (i.e., blockchains) for medical, pharmaceutical and other health system applications.

The purpose of the study was to demonstrate that cyber identities that comply with the SAFE-BioPharma standard may, via Peer Ledger APIs, enable blockchain identities to be de-anonymized, thereby fulfilling a requirement for double-blind clinical trials, audits and responsible supply chains. Prior to the study, identities associated with distributed electronic ledgers were entirely anonymous.

“Identity trust” means that there is trust in each cyber identity, using a process that proves the individual’s identity before linking it to the cyber credential. In general terms, it means that the credential can be trusted to represent the vetted identity of the individual one is doing business with but has never met face-to-face. This is critically important to the pharma/life sciences space because of several factors, including deterrence of hackers seeking valuable patient records and intellectual property, as well as compliance with regulations protecting patient data.

These discoveries underscore the power of blockchain technology to disrupt traditional practices for drug discovery, patient engagement and monitoring, payments and participatory healthcare delivery. Here, the technology leverages its quality as a shared, synchronized, distributed ledger of transactions, fostering security and decreasing fraud by providing a permanent record of who accessed ledgers and what activities they engaged in.  

The proof of concept demonstrated that SAFE-BioPharma-compliant digital identities can be tied back to the blockchain to assure trust in the identity of each person engaged in the transaction. Transactions can be anonymous until the end of a clinical study and “chained back” to the proven identity of the user, if needed, for regulatory or clinical purposes. Alternatively, the identities associated with each block can be known throughout the process, such as in track-and-trace applications for the medical supply chain.

Blockchain technology’s use of a group-consensus algorithm can be used to catch intentional or inadvertent double spending of an asset. For example, an accounts-receivable blockchain application can provide “multiple eyes” to prevent double invoicing. Similarly, a counterfeit-catching purchasing blockchain application can prevent harmful substances and devices from entering the medical system.

Ultimately, for blockchain technology to reach its full potential in any sector, myriad systems must be interoperable. Currently, healthcare technologies rarely work in a highly synchronized way with one another, which is why pharmaceutical and other medical companies that already have powerful identity management tools are trialing a number of different blockchain-based applications.

Thus far, these apps have been unable to bridge to the systems pharma companies use to establish identity credentials for their personnel. This is the problem addressed in the proof of concept. Peer Ledger has therefore developed software that now maps a trusted identity, from the Synchronoss-implemented Verizon Universal Identity Services system to blockchain credentials.

“Every SAFE-BioPharma-compliant identity credential accurately represents the proven identity of the person using it,” explains Mollie Shields-Uehling, president and CEO of SAFE-BioPharma Association. “Teaming these credentials with anonymous blockchain ledger postings enables use cases critical for overall cybersecurity across healthcare and the life sciences.”

When asked about future applications of all of this for healthcare, Shields-Uehling and Dawn Jutla, CEO and founder of Peer Ledger, highlighted three major areas of blockchain intersection.

Blockchain and clinical trials: In order to co-partner in the discovery of cures, patients may give pharmaceutical companies direct access to their digitized healthcare records, thus improving both data used for research and the speed of patient treatment. Britain’s Chief Scientific Officer, Sir Mark Walport, has argued that the National Health Service, which provides healthcare for 65 million people, should use blockchain technology to improve such tasks as the sharing of health records.

Blockchain and data collection: Earlier this year, IBM Watson Health announced it would work with the FDA to develop a secure, efficient and scalable exchange of health data using blockchain technology. Oncology data will be the initial focus.

Blockchain and personalized precision medicine: Blockchain technology’s cryptography will secure economical home healthcare sensor feeds. Trusted identity will be important to ensure that the right test results are associated with the right patient.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.5106
2017/5/22,Netki's Digital ID Service Tackles Global Compliance Challenges,"Netki, the New York–based software startup, wants to make blockchain technology more user friendly by launching its new universal Netki Digital ID service, so that anyone can access services on blockchains without re-validating their ID at every stop. The Netki Digital ID will be both KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) verified, allowing users to access a variety of blockchain businesses including financial institutions like banks, exchanges and healthcare services.

Netki wants their ID to work on any blockchain, public or private, around the world and to provide automated onboarding and validation of new customers, as well as easy sharing of digital identities.

The company’s goal is to create a digital identity certificate that uses a standard recognized by governments everywhere as legally validated, to process transactions anywhere in the world. Pricing will be based on the number of certificates and the complexity of validations.

The Digital ID uses a new peer-to-peer payment protocol (BIP 75) that allows senders, receivers and their financial partners to exchange all four identities via a private encrypted channel.

According to Netki’s announcement, the Netki Digital ID service will allow for the easy capture of an individual’s documents and biometrics via their smartphone, along with multiple levels of automated and manual verification, including database checks, machine learning and biometric analysis.

International Compliance: A “Herculean Task”

Netki IDs are already in use in the U.S. and Europe on the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains, and the company is hoping to expand its service both to new jurisdictions around the world and on new blockchain networks.

Netki’s CEO and Co-Founder Justin Newton talked to Bitcoin Magazine about the process of expanding its ID service, despite the challenge of many different legal requirements in an international regulatory environment.

The regulatory landscape is changing around the world at a rapid pace. With this in mind we designed our tools and protocols to be flexible in the case of differing, new or expanding regulatory requirements.
“As we work on each new use case, we work with the customer’s risk and compliance team to determine what requirements are appropriate for their needs.”

Newton told us their team spends time in each new jurisdiction consulting with local regulators before offering their service.

Amber D. Scott, whose company Outlier Solutions  works with blockchain startups on compliance and security issues, admires the spirit and sheer scope of Netki’s undertaking but recognizes that it is a herculean task to have any ID be compliant in every jurisdiction.

She recommends that companies planning to implement any new identification solutions should thoroughly research the requirements of the jurisdictions they are operating in, to ensure “that a solution meets those requirements in their entirety.”

Scott added, “We spend a lot of time with our clients conducting this type of testing, and very few solutions pass the tests.”

Michael Perklin, an internationally recognized security expert who oversees security for ShapeShift, acknowledges that verifying users can be time-consuming and expensive, and agrees that something like a universal ID would make this process easier.

“Many people complain that there are 20+ different identity standards and it seems that Netki is proposing a 21st. It seems like a great idea in theory but its success would depend on the community adopting the Netki ID as the industry standard as opposed to another service like uPort.”

UPort offers a mobile app that allows users to create self-sovereign credentials that would allow them to process transactions on blockchains.

Newton told us that while uPort is focusing on a business model, Netki has open-sourced their protocol. Another important difference between the two companies is that uPort stores private information on the blockchain while Netki stores information off-chain. That being said, Netki is currently partnering with uPort on several projects.

Caribbean Service Bitt Is the Test Case

Netki chose the Caribbean region to test its new service, partnering with fintech company Bitt, which provides a mobile wallet and payment services to anywhere in the world.

Newton told us:

“In terms of the project that we are working on with Bitt, we believe that one of the greatest promises of blockchain [technology] is around financial inclusion. The Caribbean region has far greater mobile phone penetration than banking penetration, and most banking is effectively controlled overseas,” he said.

By creating a locally run and focused alternative, they can lower the cost of remittance, spur inter-island trade and service many people currently excluded from banking and online finance.
Empowering Individuals Over Institutions

Netki’s founders believe that blockchain technology is the game-changer that will take society to the next level, allowing more democratization and levelling of existing silos.

Newton believes that blockchain technology is a means of empowering individuals and changing the way society interacts with each other; however, without easy access for the majority of people, universal adoption will remain a dream.

As part of simplifying and making blockchain technology more user friendly, Netki already offers a wallet-naming service for $9.99 per year, which allows users to register their unwieldy wallet address of letters and numbers to a simple name, making for easier transactions for both users and businesses.

Newton is excited about the future possibilities of blockchain technology for decentralization and democratization, saying:

“For the first time, using the standards we implemented at Bitt, and more broadly with BIP 75, regulated entities such as banks can operate on public networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum while still meeting their risk and compliance requirements.  With the recent institutional interest, and positive government movement around digital currency, these tools couldn’t come at a better time to enable the ecosystem to really step up to the next level in terms of both usage and opportunity.”

Netki is partnering with IBM in the Hyperledger Project and with PwC Australia in its Vulcan Project.

Investors in Netki include O'Reilly, AlphaTech Ventures, Colle Capital, Digital Currency Group, Plug and Play, the Husseine Group, Bitfinex and Base Ventures.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.0772
2017/5/26,Vinny Lingham Embarks on Identity Management Quest With Civic,"In January of 2016, when Vinny Lingham announced that he had stepped down as CEO of the popular mobile gift card service Gyft, speculation began to bubble up as to what innovation sandbox he would be stepping into next. A vocal advocate for Bitcoin and the blockchain movement in the media and at industry events, he has been a leading pioneer in the effort to integrate bitcoin payments at Gyft during his tenure there.

 As CEO of Civic, a new startup company focused on digital identity, Lingham is now in pursuit of a new entrepreneurial quest. Civic’s mission is to deliver secure, low-cost identity verification that’s decentralized via blockchain technology. Consumers will have the ability to share information such as their social security or identity numbers securely from any device with digital signatures that validate that the information hasn’t been tampered with.

On May 23, Lingham and Civic CTO Jonathan Smith formally announced their launch of services at Consensus 2017, offering a viable solution to ID theft, fake online profiles and bank accounts, and other data breaches that have an adverse impact on consumer identity. Civic also unveiled their plans at the Token Summit for a token offering on the Ethereum platform. A final token will be issued on the RSK platform.

Civic tokens will provide access to the product while allowing token holders to benefit from its network effect. Overall, Civic endeavors to raise $33 million through the token sale, with additional tokens beyond that allocated to enterprise partners and developers. The company has already received $2.75 million in funding via Social Leverage, an early-stage seed investment fund, as well as through various VC firms that are engaged in Bitcoin and blockchain technology, including Pantera Capital, Blockchain Capital and Digital Currency Group.

Civic’s stealth digital identity platform is designed to replace passwords, usernames and the need for biometrics. The company’s main value proposition targets the explosion of data breaches that hit both consumers and the businesses they engage with. Civic will deliver applications for securing cryptocurrencies, e-signatures, social accounts, financial services, e-commerce/credit cards and medical records. Moreover, it will have the capacity to be used as a digital replacement for passports, driver’s licenses and voter ID, among other utilities.

Consumers will install an app on their smart device, and when someone attempts to access their SSNs within their personal ecosystems, they get notified. This serves as a preventive measure for the unauthorized use of personal information. Ultimately the goal is to deliver solutions for consumers to better control their personal information while providing a positive customer service experience.

Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Lingham noted that ID theft is a pervasive issue, especially with the recent spate of around 2,000 data breaches per year in the U.S. alone.

Civic wants to solve this problem by granting people control of their identity and where their personal information is stored. By verifying their information and storing it on their personal devices, consumers can ensure that their identity information is only distributed to authorized parties. 
He emphasized that when a consumer or business uses the Civic login service, no usernames or passwords are created, thereby reducing the vulnerabilities associated around one hack being able to to access other accounts.

Lingham believes that blockchains are likely the most secure place to store information right now, which is why Civic is constantly assessing opportunities to leverage and capitalize on the emerging technology.

Regarding the often-knotty scenarios created around securing government acceptance and collaboration, Lingham said: “We believe that the technology we have is unique and highly differentiated. That said, as we continue to build our user base and network for acceptance, this will draw in governments. We have already had some interest in this area and believe it will only be a matter of time.”

Based in Palo Alto, California, Lingham says he plans to open an office in his native South Africa with the goal of hiring developers there. He decided to take this ambitious step following reforms to South Africa’s business regulations that have created a more favorable environment for investments.

“We’ve always believed that one of the best applications for cryptocurrencies was the ability to power something like voting, one day,” said Lingham. “In order to get there, the larger distributed mobile identity problem needed to be solved first. This is what we are focusing on now — to build the world’s largest identity platform, powered by technology that decentralizes and secures consumer identity information.”",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.9974
2017/6/13,Will Blockchain-Based Gun Control Keep Your Family Safer?,"Gun violence continues to be a hot topic. Gang violence in neighborhoods, terrorist attacks in cities, accidental gun discharge among kids, mass attacks at schools and businesses — these and other forms of gun activities are leading to calls for reform throughout the world.

Through the use of smart technology, the startup Blocksafe seeks to deliver a blockchain-centric solution for gun ownership and their safe use. Its core premise is predicated on a key issue tied to firearms, namely the danger they pose when they migrate into the hands of non-owners.

With the support of the Blocksafe Foundation, an organization evangelizing smart-gun technology and gun-ownership freedoms, an innovative device and decentralized network is advancing in its development. Its mission is to create a safer world through weapons tracking and accountability, preventing guns from falling into the wrong hands and being utilized by unauthorized gun users.

Citizens, law enforcement agencies and armed security firms will have 24/7 real-time access to the secure and anonymous Blocksafe network, thereby allowing them the ability to self-monitor their supported firearms devices. Owners can receive notifications if shots are fired by an unauthorized user of their guns. Moreover, they have the ability to locate and disable a stolen weapon, all through the Blocksafe app or web portal.

It should be noted, however, that Blocksafe cannot identify the actual shooter who is utilizing the firearm. Rather it’s more of a tracking mechanism for both individual owners as well as gun store owners, giving them peace of mind as to where their firearms are at all times.

By way of example, an adult at work might remember that his gun is possibly accessible to his kids at home. Blocksafe can help him track where the gun actually is and even remotely disable it. Again, the goal is to offer some semblance of control to the owner in the event that the firearm ends up in the hands of an unauthorized user, which often results in a gun tragedy.

Another illustrative use case: A gun owner whose house is robbed while she is away can remotely disable the stolen firearm, rendering it unable to be resold or used later in a crime.

Pulling the Trigger on Innovation
Kevin Barnes, founder and chairman of Blocksafe, is an honorably discharged U.S. Army veteran, blockchain developer and passionate advocate of gun ownership. He is also a tech coder of 20 years.

Raised among liberty-minded gun lovers, he was taught to embrace the U.S. constitutional right to bear arms first and foremost. As he listened to and read about politicians pushing smart-gun efforts in the media, he feared a loss of life or liberty due to risks inherited by a centralized smart-gun infrastructure. These concerns led him to launch Blocksafe.

In this interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Barnes discusses the evolution of Blocksafe and his greatest hopes around the future of gun safety worldwide.  

Can you describe the moment when the Blocksafe idea first struck you?
Being an avid gun lover, I was at a range teaching my wife to shoot various firearms and she began thinking about what to do if she was overpowered by a thug while she was armed. At that moment the concept of “Blocksafe” was born. 

In layman's terms, what is Blocksafe?
I tend to think of Blocksafe as a light version of particle.io for enhanced firearm technology. It is a full-stack IoT device network that gives innovators what they need to enable users to securely manage their devices and data. Blocksafe can also facilitate an innovator’s use case in IoT development, expediting their roadmap to the market with security and anonymity for the user and sensor data being the major area of focus.

Blocksafe enables innovators to develop a myriad of solutions to solve the problems associated with firearms — such as malware and ransomware risks — that were not possible before without compromise.

How does this benefit the gun industry?
Decentralized applications (DApps) can be developed in a way that greatly benefits companies in the gun industry. For example, a third-party device is created by a manufacturer. They could install a custom-built DApp onto it, so the manufacturer can easily track its inventory and distribution.

What about the economics of your solution?
Economically, revenue can be generated from the upsale of enhanced add-on devices to firearms. With the cost of the IoT infrastructure greatly reduced, innovators can focus on improving their product to meet market demands, especially those from a newer generation who are always connected. Innovators can also better meet government and commercial needs for these enhancing devices.

What sorts of other use cases are being bantered about?
Here are a few that might align with the Blocksafe model.

Litigation: enhancing the authenticity of a camera video allowed in court proceedings.

Product Theft: a gunstore can recoup their firearms if stolen.

Insurance: armoured trucks and security companies in general can better monitor and manage the firearm usage of their employees.

Training: Instructors can use analytics to study shooting skills to better train students, thereby reducing the likelihood of accidents.

What are Blocksafe trigger tokens and how will they work?
Triggers are the appropriately named “tokens” that power every event from smart devices to the Blocksafe network. The token is an Counterparty asset (which may become ERC223 later) that will be introduced during demonstrations at CoinAgenda in Las Vegas later this year.

What else are you currently introducing?
Soon we will be demonstrating with the TrackingPoint M400 to our  smart-gun network. There are many sensors, a smart trigger and a smart scope on the firearm that make it a great candidate to use in demonstration.

We will also be introducing another DApp use case made for mobile phones and tablets called “Gunshot Spot.” It’s a free gunfire-mapping app and token wallet that sends notifications of gunfire and its proximity. Users will have the option to anonymously share the data to the app community, which will be used to populate gunfire mapping within the app using Blocksafe. Think of it as SpotCrime for gunfire.

What steps have you taken to garner support from the gun industry?
We have provided a pilot signup page for our network’s web portal. We are also in talks with many firearm and accessory manufacturers, some of which we met at the recent NRA show in Atlanta. A quarter of them expressed positive interest in Blocksafe as they recognize that nothing is stopping the progression of defense tech and the launch of Blocksafe. One exhibitor summed it up in one sentence: “Blocksafe’s use case is that it enables use cases development for enhanced firearm solutions that were never possible before.”

We’ve also received a lot of support from organizations that support the firearm industry such as Smart Tech Foundation, which we plan to join in their effort to support startup innovators entering the enhanced firearm space.

What is your response to libertarians and others concerned about gun privacy and anonymity?
What I say to them is that enhanced firearm tech is going to continue to develop no matter what. When I was following the smart-gun mandates from President Obama and his administration, all I could picture was my wife, kids and future grandkids with a weapon that some third party could share control of.

As a programmer of 20 years and a Bitcoin enthusiast, I realized the only solution was to bring to market a network that would prevent that nightmare. At the same time, we can use the blockchain to save lives by enhancing the very tool that has been protecting our freedom in such a way that the device owner keeps full control of the device features and data.

As is the belief of many libertarians, I have the liberty to choose how to defend myself and my family. It is our human right. Whether it is using a 25-year-old revolver or a TrackingPoint AR, we all have the liberty to choose our firearm of choice.

But how do you think these arguments will sit with the government?
We spend millions to politically protect our legal rights to defend ourselves. We must also focus on making sure the technology is not used against us — as, without an alternative, the chances of technical tyranny is a threat too great to chance — regardless of the laws.

Plus, I think it is cool not being able to be shot with my own weapon.

What is your long-term, grand vision for Blocksafe?
Simply to continue to help grow the enhanced-firearm space including expanding the consortium globally. We will try to incubate startups and launch Smart Gun News to showcase the innovators and aggregate news in the space. We also endeavor to work with nations to adopt blockchain tech and their smart city efforts in general. Ultimately, as I see it, it’s about promoting a safer and more peaceful world full of liberty.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.1027
2017/6/19,Project TITANIUM: The EU’s Plan to Decloak Cryptocurrency,"Monitor blockchains, deanonymize wallet addresses, surveil dark net markets, and stop terrorists and money launderers: that’s the main thrust of the European Union’s Project TITANIUM.

TITANIUM, which stands for Tools for the Investigation of Transactions in Underground Markets, is a three-year, €5 million ($5.5 million) project that will unite universities, private research firms and law enforcement agencies from the U.K., Germany, Spain, Austria, the Netherlands and Finland.

Project TITANIUM will develop tools and best practices for criminal investigations involving cryptocurrency in Europe, which, up to now, most law enforcement agencies have pursued on an ad-hoc basis.

The project plans to create forensic tools to spot clusters of addresses controlled by the same entity; identify mixers or tumbler addresses used for money laundering; crawl the webs, both clear and dark; and automate information gathering about illegal activities.

The project’s coordinator, Dr. Ross King of the Austrian Institute of Technology, said that criminal and terrorist uses of cryptocurrencies and dark net markets “evolve quickly.” King also insisted that Project TITANIUM would respect “citizen privacy.”

Project TITANIUM’s announcement comes just a few weeks after the ransomware worm WannaCry disabled hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150 countries. As of June 15, 2017, the hardcoded wallet addresses used by the attackers have collected about 50 BTC in ransom payments.

The project’s scope covers terrorism, as well as crime, and back-to-back attacks in Manchester and London have ignited calls for more sweeping government action to combat extremism.

On June 4, 2017, Prime Minister Theresa May called for “international agreements to regulate cyberspace” and to deny violent extremists “safe spaces” online. With terrorism in the background, cooperation on internal security matters like Project TITANIUM is likely to continue even after the U.K. formally exits the EU.

The call for more surveillance comes despite the fact that the United Kingdom already has one of the most wide-ranging surveillance laws, the Investigatory Powers Act, which went into force December 30, 2016.

Nicknamed the Snooper’s Charter, the act requires ISPs keep record of all websites users visit for one year and allows police and other public agencies to check anyone’s history without a warrant.

Meanwhile, the EU is mulling a more direct approach to the problem of cryptocurrency. According to a proposed directive released on March 9, 2017, the EU could require exchanges and wallet providers to submit account owners’ identities to a central database.

The directive goes on that “virtual currencies should not be anonymous,” and that the anonymity or pseudo-anonymity of cryptocurrencies is “more a hindrance than an asset” for legitimate users.

The rules would not just apply to bitcoin, but all “virtual currencies,” and would effectively ban anonymous cryptocurrency, at least in the EU. The proposed directive is intended to combat money laundering and terrorism, despite scant evidence that cryptocurrencies play a prominent role in either.

Nevertheless, with or without evidence that they are empowering terrorists, the anonymous or pseudo-anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies is threatening to European lawmakers, and whether through legislation or projects like TITANIUM, they intend to decloak cryptocurrency.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.9854
2017/7/12,Privacy Project TumbleBit Inches Closer to Release With Tor Integration and New Wallet,"TumbleBit is one of the most promising privacy-enhancing technologies being built on top of Bitcoin right now. It allows users to mix their coins fully anonymously, without requiring trust in any third party. An advanced version of the technology, which requires Segregated Witness, can even be utilized as a second-layer payment hub to reduce transaction costs and speed up confirmation times.

After TumbleBit was first proposed in an academic paper and subsequently presented at the Scaling Bitcoin workshops in Milan, NBitcoin lead developer Nicolas Dorier built an early version of the technology. Since then, two wallets are being developed to make TumbleBit accessible for everyday use: Breeze and, more recently, HiddenWallet.

HiddenWallet developer Ádám Ficsór, better known online as “nopara73,” also completed Tor integration this week.

I estimate that TumbleBit will be usable for the general public within a month or two. —Ádám Ficsór
Tor Integration
TumbleBit lets users connect to a central server, which in turn allows them to establish payment channels that send coins back and forth in such a way that everyone receives as many coins as they sent. Multiple users can engage at the same time, which allows them to mix their coins, breaking the trail of ownership on Bitcoin’s blockchain.

The key innovation compared to previous mixing models is that TumbleBit uses a combination of nifty cryptographic tricks to make sure that, first off, no one can steal funds. And second, no one — not even the central server — can link any of the sending addresses to any of the receiving addresses.

Well, almost. One problem remained, as Ficsór explained:

“Users connect to the central server with their own IP address to provide their sending and receiving addresses,” he said. “But this means that the central server could still match sending and receiving addresses based on the IP address that provided them. If one IP address provides both Bitcoin addresses, it’s trivial to link them.”

This would of course defeat the purpose of using TumbleBit in the first place.

Ficsór therefore built a Tor-integration tool for the existing TumbleBit project. With this tool, the sending and receiving addresses of any user are separately provided to the central server through the anonymity network. This removes any link from a user’s IP address to any specific Bitcoin addresses and — importantly — removes the link between sending and receiving addresses as well.

Wallet Privacy
At the same time, Ficsór is developing a new wallet specifically designed for TumbleBit, HiddenWallet. And interestingly, this wallet would even offer increased privacy without TumbleBit.

Essentially all lightweight wallets leak address data to the outside world in some way or another. Most web wallets, mobile wallets and some desktop wallets leak this info because they rely on a server that tells them about their balances. This server therefore needs to know all addresses in a wallet and can link them together accordingly.

Alternatively, some SPV clients send out a type of cryptographic “puzzle” (Bloom filters) to the network that requests all data relevant for their balance. But this leaks address data to random nodes on the network … and thus to analytics companies that specifically monitor the network for these puzzles.

“Blockstream’s Jonas Nick claimed in 2014 that if someone were to give him one Bitcoin address, he’d be able to figure out 70 percent of your wallet holdings. This was just one smart guy with limited resources, three years ago. You can imagine what well-funded analytics companies in 2017 are capable of,” Ficsór noted.

This linking of addresses is obviously a problem for TumbleBit users. No matter how much these users mix their bitcoins across their Bitcoin addresses, if all these addresses can be linked together anyway, there’s no point.

The only wallets that avoid this problem, so far, are full-node wallets like Bitcoin Core. These wallets download all transaction data on the network, meaning they don’t need to request specific data that reveals their own addresses. However, full nodes can be a bit resource-intensive, which is a barrier to entry for many casual Bitcoin users.

HiddenWallet
HiddenWallet introduces a clever model in between the lightweight and full-node wallets, specifically designed to improve privacy.

Like a full node, HiddenWallet connects directly to the Bitcoin network, where it likewise requests all transaction data from random nodes. However, where full nodes verify (and typically store) all of this data, HiddenWallet instead immediately discards any data it doesn’t need. It only verifies and stores transaction data that involve the Bitcoin addresses in the wallet itself and doesn’t care about the rest. This requires far fewer resources than a full node does.

“The privacy benefit is obvious,” said Ficsór. “Since HiddenWallet downloads all transaction data, connected nodes have no idea which data is kept by the wallet and what is discarded. They learn nothing about the addresses in HiddenWallet and can’t link any of them together.”

And Ficsór thinks he may be able to trim resource usage down even further in a next release of HiddenWallet. This upcoming version may cut out all transaction data that would, for analytics companies, obviously not be relevant to the wallet anyway. This includes old transaction data, but also specific types of transactions. Such a modification could potentially make HiddenWallet available even on low-bandwidth mobile connections.

With this progress, it looks like TumbleBit may be usable even before the end of this summer, Ficsór estimates.

“We previously thought we might get the system up and running around this time, but it turned out there was a little bit more to it than we thought. That being said, another big hurdle is now taken: the Japanese company United Bitcoiners is running a tumbling server. Combined with Tor integration and wallets, all pieces of the puzzle are coming together.”",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.9583
2017/7/13,Latest Cryptocurrency Exchange Hack Highlights Need for Better Security Protocols,"It comes with the territory that digital currency will be susceptible to digital threats. Hacking and theft have almost grown up side by side with things like Bitcoin, and, as the popularity and value of the digital currency rises, its attraction to thieves also grows.

The most recent major hack has seen one of the top five biggest Bitcoin and Ethereum exchanges, Bithumb in South Korea, fall prey to hackers. The hack was confirmed July 5 when information, as well as hundreds of millions of South Korean won, were been made off with in an attack with a difference.

Most exchanges know they are susceptible to network intrusion via their internal systems, but the entry point in this instance was through the personal computer of one of the exchange's employees. Thus it was not the standard network compromise, rather a more sophisticated phishing attack that led to the information heist.

It was personal information, such as names, email address and phone numbers of clients that were predominantly taken — luckily no passwords — but this was enough for the hackers to target customers and drain their accounts of their cryptocurrency.

Since the highly publicized Mt. Gox hack in 2014, in which 800,000 bitcoins were stolen, exchanges have boosted their security astronomically. Mt. Gox almost spelled the end of Bitcoin as people lost a lot of faith — as well as a lot of money — in the security systems of cryptocurrencies.

While security has been boosted in recent times, and thievery and hacking is far less common, it is still a threat that is ongoing and sometimes hidden.

In fact, Bithumb customers had forwarded complaints on a Korean social media site about threats of attacks, yet not much extra was done on the part of the exchange to try and quell these worries or protect clients.

The exact figure stolen is still unknown as Bithumb is trying to play it off as less of a hack and more of a phishing attack for information. However, despite what they are trying to convey, Bithumb has to admit that the 30,000 customers whose information was compromised were victims of a dangerous cryptocurrency attack.

The Korean exchange has come forward and said it will be compensating those whose data was compromised. Even those customers who would have lost nothing other than data will be getting paid 100,000 Korean Won, which is equivalent to around $86.50 USD for the inconvenience. The hope for Bithumb is that they will be able to retain some of these clients who surely will be feeling much more vulnerable and less trusting.

Bithumb's transactions with bitcoin make up almost 3 percent of the entire market, but it is its share of ether transactions that’s its major claim to fame: 13.5 percent of the total ether market goes through Bithumb’s exchange.

It is a major blow for a big player in the exchange game, and it is a blow that will be felt in the global digital currency sphere. Trust has slowly been rebuilt for those who have lived through the teething stages of Bitcoin security, and, as the door opens on new and mainstream markets, hacks like this can cause adopters to have second thoughts.

However, one aspect of digital security that has changed since bitcoin has been accepted by a much wider audience is that governmental agencies are taking it under their wing.

There are differing stages of regulation for digital currencies, but these arguably bring with them added security. In the case of Bithumb, Korea’s Internet and Security Agency has plans to initiate a probe into this cyber attack with a full investigation to follow.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.6486
2017/8/18,HiddenWallet and Samourai Wallet Join Forces to Make Bitcoin Private With ZeroLink,"Ádám “nopara73” Ficsór, HiddenWallet developer and TumbleBit contributor, and “TDevD,” the pseudonymous Samourai wallet developer, are joining forces on a new privacy project: ZeroLink. ZeroLink is set to realize a trustless mixing scheme first proposed by Bitcoin Core contributor Gregory Maxwell years ago — but one that hasn’t been realized thus far.

According Ficsór, the ZeroLink framework, which utilizes a scheme known as “Chaumian CoinJoin,” is actually more straightforward than many of the alternatives that have been proposed.

“Back in 2013, there was this sort of obsession with decentralization. ‘Everything that can be decentralized will be decentralized’ was the slogan,” the developer recalls. “By now we realize that decentralization is actually not always that useful. As long as a mixer cannot steal funds or link transactions, that’s enough.”

CoinJoin
Each Bitcoin transaction essentially sends bitcoins from one or several Bitcoin addresses (really: “inputs”) to one or several Bitcoin addresses (really: “outputs”). That’s how bitcoins “move” over the blockchain.

The problem, from a privacy perspective, is that the blockchain is completely public, which means that anyone can see which addresses are paying which addresses. If these addresses can be linked to real-world identities, it can reveal a lot about who transacted with whom, and perhaps for what.

CoinJoin, the well-known coin-mixing scheme first proposed by Maxwell in 2013, is a potential solution to this problem. A CoinJoin transaction is basically a combination of several transactions merged into one big transaction. In other words, it includes inputs from several different users, and the bitcoins move to outputs controlled by several different users. As such, it’s not clear which bitcoins moved where. All users effectively paid all users.

While that’s great, the next problem is that whomever or whatever combines the different transactions into one CoinJoin transaction can be a central point of failure from a privacy perspective. That person (or that server, or whatever it is) still knows which bitcoins moved where. So if that individual is either corrupt or corruptible, the problem isn’t really solved.

“For CoinJoin to live up to its promise, even the entity that creates the transaction must not learn which addresses are paying which addresses,” Ficsór noted.

ZeroLink
ZeroLink provides a privacy framework for wallets that can be used for different mixing schemes. And it defines its own mixing technique as well: an implementation of CoinJoin referred to as “Chaumian CoinJoin.”

With Chaumian CoinJoin, users both send and receive equal amounts of bitcoin from a CoinJoin transaction, so everyone receives each other's coins. This obfuscates the trails for all of these coins.

In practice, ZeroLink users will require two types of wallets: a pre-mix wallet and a post-mix wallet. As the names suggest, the first type holds coins that are to be mixed, while the latter is where the mixed coins end up.

Users then connect their pre-mix wallets to the ZeroLink tumbler and provide an input (“from” address) and an output (“to” address), which they both control. But importantly, the outputs are disguised (“blinded”) using a mathematical trick. So while the tumbler knows where all bitcoins are sent from, it does not yet know where bitcoins are sent to.

At the heart of the trick, the tumbler then cryptographically signs all blinded outputs, using a type of cryptographic signature introduced by David Chaum: a “blind signature.” This allows data to be cryptographically signed even if it is disguised. And importantly, these signatures can be checked against the original, unblinded data as well to see if the blinded data and the unblinded data match.

Next, all users connect to the tumbler again, but this time through some type of anonymity network, like Tor. They will then provide the tumbler with the unblinded versions of the outputs. Using the cryptographic signatures it just created, the tumbler can check that all revealed outputs match all blinded outputs. If they do match, the tumbler knows that all the outputs it received are legitimate, and thus were provided by the same users that also provided the inputs to send funds.

The tumbler then adds the revealed outputs to the CoinJoin transaction. And it sends this transaction back to all users, for these users to sign with their Bitcoin private keys. Doing so validates the transaction. (The users should of course double check that the amounts and their outputs check out, to be sure they receive as much as they send.)

Finally, the tumbler broadcasts the CoinJoin transaction to be included in a Bitcoin block. As a result, all users end up with different bitcoins than they started with: all bitcoins were mixed, and the blockchain trails broken.

While all this is actually relatively straightforward compared to some alternative schemes, and to a large extent already suggested by Maxwell back in 2013, the process has never been realized. This is probably because it was long thought to be too vulnerable to attacks, Ficsór thinks.

“When Maxwell first published the proposal, Bitcoin transaction fees were practically non-existent. Because of this, it would be relatively easy and cheap to launch denial of service attacks against a CoinJoin mixing system. An attacker can just keep providing valid inputs, but refuse to sign when he should. That invalidates the whole transaction, and wastes everyone’s time.”

Interestingly, this attack vector is now to some extent resolved simply because it would be too expensive to keep it going. In order to maintain the attack in a way that it’s not easily countered, an attacker must provide new inputs for each round, meaning he must be able to keep moving bitcoins to new addresses to do so. “Assuming $1 transaction fees, that could cost up to $1,000 a day,” Ficsór pointed out. “In this particular context, high fees are a blessing in disguise.”

Development
Ficsór is currently about to help wrap up the development of another highly anticipated privacy tool, TumbleBit, for Stratis’s Breeze Wallet. This is expected to take another three months.

After that, he plans to focus on realizing ZeroLink, while TDevD may even start working on the framework sooner. Concretely, three new codebases need to be developed: the pre-mix wallet, the tumbler and the post-mix wallet.

“The tumbler needs to be developed from scratch. But it should be relatively easy to add the pre-mix wallets to any existing open source wallet. The same is true for the post-mix wallet implementations, though for privacy reasons not all wallets are a good fit,” Ficsór said.

His own HiddenWallet as well as Samourai Wallet are “fully committed” to implementing and deploying ZeroLink into production, Ficsór said, while Breeze Wallet may be interested as well.

Optimistically, an initial implementation of ZeroLink could be live before the end of this year.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.296
2017/9/28,How Decentralized Exchanges Make Bitcoin More Resilient (and Us More Free),"Governments and central banks all over the world are gradually warming up to the idea of leveraging the unique advantages offered by blockchain technology — low-cost transactions permanently recorded in tamper-proof distributed ledgers — to modernize their financial systems.

According to sources familiar with the matter, the Indian government is considering a proposal to introduce its own cryptocurrency similar to Bitcoin, Business Standard reported last week. The new cryptocurrency would be managed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and could be called “Lakshmi.” Other central banks are exploring similar ideas.

Of course, that will take time, and the governments are unlikely to support important features that make Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies appealing to end users, such as mining and near-anonymous, paperwork-free transactions. Therefore, Bitcoin, Ethereum and at least some altcoins are likely to continue to prosper.

But some governments, such as China’s, don’t seem to like that. After banning Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), the Chinese government is moving to close the cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the country.

It appears that governments love blockchain technology but hate Bitcoin itself, as well as other “crypto-anarchic” digital currencies. Some governments are reacting in a panic because they are starting to realize that they can’t stop Bitcoin from becoming an alternative to their monopoly on currency, both as a means of exchange and a store of value. Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges are especially vulnerable, and other governments could follow China.

A Role for Decentralized Exchanges
Decentralized exchanges that use peer-to-peer (P2P) technology to bypass the need for a central exchange provider are an interesting option that could make blockchain-based digital currencies much more resilient.

Decred recently introduced atomic swap support for exchange-free cryptocurrency trading, showing that, at least for crypto-to-crypto trading (for example, exchanging bitcoin for litecoin), it’s perfectly possible to operate without exchanges. However, this doesn’t solve the problem of crypto-to-fiat and fiat-to-crypto trading, which is arguably of top concern for cryptocurrency users.

“Atomic swaps are the first sign in a new wave of decentralization,” Decred project lead Jake Yocom-Piatt told Bitcoin Magazine. “As trustless exchanges between pairs of cryptocurrencies, they offer new efficiencies for users who don’t need the formality of the traditional exchanges. It is going to be interesting to see how the trend develops, since for larger and more complex transactions with fiat currencies, LocalBitcoins and established exchanges are still the place to be.”  

Coinffeine is developing an open-source, P2P Bitcoin exchange platform that will enable users to buy and sell bitcoins securely and anonymously, without having to rely on a centralized exchange. The project seems promising, but it hasn’t shown much activity recently.

Bisq (formerly Bitsquare) provides an open-source desktop application that allows users to buy and sell bitcoins anonymously in exchange for national currencies or alternative cryptocurrencies. To protect users from fraud, both traders are required to place security deposits into a multisig-based escrow mechanism; the deposits are refunded after a trade completes. To handle disputes, Bisq features a decentralized and open arbitrator system. Bisq is now preparing to launch a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and its BSQ token, a colored coin on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Decentralization and Freedom
Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Bisq developer Chris Beams for comments on government attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges, likely attack vectors and the impact of decentralized exchanges. Beams also offered a passionate and forceful defense of individual liberty against government over-interference.

“The panic has to set in at some point,” argued Beams. “But it will do so at different times for different governments, and will produce a range of responses from them when it does. I don’t think China’s recent actions — whether they’re the product of panic or something more strategic — will necessarily cascade into similar actions in the U.S. or Europe. Shuttering all exchanges by diktat is the kind of textbook totalitarianism the world has come to expect from China, but a similar attack wouldn’t work as well in the U.S. Even if it would, it would be a blunder for the U.S. to attack Bitcoin with such a blunt instrument. It would be suboptimal, a bad use of available resources. It would strengthen the decentralized exchanges that already exist and it would incentivize the creation of better, even more censorship-resistant ones.”

According to Beams, the U.S. in particular has much more effective tools at its disposal, especially Know Your Customer (KYC). The U.S. government forces nearly every centralized exchange, on day one of operation, to collect personal identity information about their users and to correlate trading activity with those identities.

Beams explained that U.S. corporations tend to take compliance seriously and actually do cooperate with these rules, meaning that U.S. regulatory agencies have, in principle at least, access to enough information to de-anonymize a large and growing percentage of all Bitcoin transactions. And plausible traceability of transactions is all they need to keep the threat of tax collection in force.

“If I were the U.S., I’d be ushering new Bitcoiners through the Coinbase cattle gate just as fast as they can be prodded,” said Beams. “If I were the U.S., I would have long since concluded there’s nothing fundamental I can do to stop Bitcoin itself, so if I can’t beat ’em, I’ll at least make sure I can continue to tax ’em.”

The recent John Doe summons delivered to Coinbase by the IRS shows that KYC is the attack vector of choice for the U.S., which could result in billions in taxes reported by people who fear that their Bitcoin activity can be audited. KYC appears to be a much more effective long-term attack vector than heavy-handed shutdown orders.

“So yes, by all means, let’s bring on the decentralized exchanges,” said Beams. “But they’d better be really and truly decentralized because if a government can stop them, they will — at least once they get big enough to become worth the effort. The attack vector with decentralized exchanges won’t be KYC, though, because any decentralized exchange that implements KYC will instantly be abandoned by its users.”

The attack vector for decentralized exchanges, said Beams, will be “the good ole four horsemen of the infocalypse.” In other words, decentralized exchanges will be vilified as tools for drug dealers, terrorists, pedophiles and money launderers.

“It’s the same script every time a government is interested in talking people out of their own freedoms. This attack vector won’t work for the exchanges that have achieved escape velocity levels of decentralization, but it may stop some and will make life difficult for others.”

Beams suggested that the only way to really stop decentralized crypto-fiat exchanges would be to outlaw Bitcoin trading altogether. “This would force people to think twice about every trade, and to consider whether their counterparty might be an agent, which would result in a profound chilling effect.”

However, he thinks that this sort of heavy-handed attack seems unlikely to be attempted in the U.S. or Europe because there are just too many vested interests in Bitcoin now. It’s more likely that the authorities will continue to insist on KYC, tolerate compliant centralized exchanges and demonize the decentralized ones.

“With all that having been said, I’m actually optimistic,” concluded Beams. “Attacks by state actors — real and threatened — are making every part of this ecosystem stronger. Bitcoin has proven itself anti-fragile as hell thus far, and by the time all the battles have been waged, what will emerge on the other side are alternatives to existing financial institutions — money, banks, exchanges and all the rest — that are actually better in every way than their traditional counterparts.


“We are being forced by the threat of state violence to design crypto-economic systems with the highest degrees of security, privacy and censorship resistance baked in from the protocol level up. That very pressure is what is propelling these solutions forward, I think, into a bright future of genuine financial freedom for people. I wouldn’t be working on this stuff if I thought otherwise.”",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.9832
2017/12/5,Bitcoin Exchanges Are Favorite Targets of Global DDoS Attacks: Report,"Imperva Incapsula,a cloud-based service provider, has released a comprehensive report titled “Q3 2017 Global DDoS Threat Landscape.” The report shows that cryptocurrency operators and Bitcoin exchanges are favorite targets of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.

A DDoS attack is defined as a persistent DDoS event against the same target (e.g., IP address or domain). A single attack is preceded by a quiet (attack free) period of at least 60 minutes and followed by another quiet period of the same duration or longer. Previous Imperva reports had considered DDoS attack bursts separated by 10 minute quiet periods, but then increased the quiet period time threshold to 60 minutes in order to aggregate successive attacks.

DDoS attacks can be either network layer attacks that cause network saturation by consuming much of the available bandwidth or application layer attacks that bring down a server by consuming much of its processing resources (e.g., CPU or RAM) with a high number of requests; they are often facilitated by DDoS botnets. DDoS bots often masquerade as browsers (human visitors) or legitimate bots (e.g., search engine crawlers) to bypass security measures.

The Imperva report is based on data from 3,920 network layer and 1,755 application layer DDoS attacks on websites using Imperva Incapsula services from July 1, 2017, through September 30, 2017. Information about DDoS botnets was gathered by analyzing data from 37.4 billion DDoS attack requests collected over the same period.

Network layer DDoS attacks are measured in Mpps (million packets per second) and Gbps (gigabits per second), which indicate, respectively, the rate at which packets are delivered and the total load placed on a network. Five percent of network layer attacks reached 50 Mpps, while the largest peaked at 238 Mpps.

Application layer DDoS attacks are measured in RPS (requests per second), and the overall impact also depends on the amount of workload that a single request can force on a target server. The main difference between the two DDoS-attack types is that one will target network connections and the other will target computing resources; each requires a different set of security methods for risk mitigation.

The report noted that the cryptocurrency industry continues to be a frequent target of DDoS attacks, more so than many larger industries. In fact, three out of every four bitcoin sites were attacked in Q3 2017.

“[We] saw attacks targeting a relatively high number of cryptocurrency exchanges and services,” states the report. “This was likely related to a recent spike in the price of bitcoin, which more than doubled in the span of the quarter. Overall, more than 73% of all bitcoin sites using our services were attacked this quarter, making it one of the most targeted industries, despite its relatively small size and web presence.”

Other sectors frequently targeted by DDoS attacks are internet service providers and online gambling and gaming operators.

For network layer DDoS attacks, the U.S., China, Hong Kong and the Philippines are among the top five countries, in terms of both number of attacks received and number of targets. Germany is also frequently attacked, with 12.8 percent of the total number of DDoS attacks.

Hong Kong had only 5.1 percent of targets but was targeted by almost a third of all network layer attacks in Q3 2017. This was largely due to a large-scale campaign against a local hosting service provider which was hit more than 700 times throughout the quarter.

For application layer DDoS attacks, the U.S. had both the highest number of attacks and the highest number of targets, with the Netherlands coming in a distant second. The largest application layer attack targeted a financial services company headquartered in Europe, which was hit multiple times. The remainder of the list include developed countries with mature digital marketplaces, such as Singapore, Japan and Australia.

Identifying the origination of DDoS bots is difficult because the practice of faking a source IP — called IP spoofing — can make IP geo-data collected during DDoS attacks unreliable. IP spoofing is only possible for network layer attacks, however, since full TCP connections must be established before sending requests in application layer attacks. Thus, only data from application layer attacks was used to identify bot location.

In Q3 2017, 17 percent of botnet traffic originated in China, which represents a significant drop from the previous quarter, when China was the source of 63 percent of botnet traffic. Turkey and India are on the rise and account for 7.2 and 4 percent of botnet traffic respectively. China remains the top location of attack devices with over 40 percent of the total.

Application layer attack traffic generated by bots that can bypass cookie challenges increased to 6.4 percent in Q3 2017 from 2.1 percent in the previous quarter. Of these bots,1.8 percent were also able to parse JavaScript, an increase from 1.4 percent in Q2 2017.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.9984
2017/12/19,"After Second Hack This Year, South Korean Exchange Youbit Closes Down","South Korean exchange Youbit announced on its website today that it is closing down after a hack early Tuesday, December 19, 2017, that resulted in the loss of 17 percent of its assets.

The exchange, previously known as Yapizon, did not indicate how many bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies were stolen or what the total fiat value of the attack amounted to, but it was enough to lead to bankruptcy.

This was the second hack the exchange suffered this year. A prior attack in April 2017, resulted in the loss of 3,816 bitcoins, worth around $5 million at the time.

Youbit said hackers broke into its hot wallet, the online account used to pay out cryptocurrencies instantly. While hot wallets offer greater convenience, they also put funds at greater risk because they are connected to the internet.

The remaining coins were kept offline in a cold wallet, the exchange said, resulting in no additional losses. The exchange indicated that customers could withdraw up to 75 percent of their balances, and the rest would be tallied out after the final settlement.

Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA), the state agency that responds to cyberattacks, is investigating the incident, as reported in Reuters. KISA has maintained that North Korean hackers were behind the first hack.

Chris Doman, threat engineer at software security company AlienVault, told Bitcoin Magazine, he suspects BlueNoroff, a subgroup of North Korea’s cyber crime group Lazarus is responsible for the second Youbit attack. Lazarus is known for the November 2014 hack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, one of the biggest corporate breaches in history.

While attacks by Lazarus have mainly been aimed at social disruption, recent reports indicate the group is increasingly going after money. With the value of bitcoin surging to all-time highs, exchanges are becoming a lucrative target.

“The first time I saw them target a Bitcoin company was in May this year — the same month they unleashed WannaCry,” Doman said in a statement shared with Bitcoin Magazine.


The exchange that Doman was refering to is South Korean Bitcoin exchange Bithumb. Around that same time, WannaCry ransomware attacks were encrypting user’s computers and offering to de-encrypt them in exchange for bitcoin. Analysis of the techniques used in the WannaCry attacks show strong links to Lazarus.  

Doman added, “They’ve also used related malware to opportunistically mine Monero coins on compromised servers. Clearly they have a large interest in cryptocurrencies as an easy method for economic gain, as well as an opportunity to economically weaken their enemies.”

Although Youbit is one of the smaller bitcoin exchanges, the hack underscores the risk involved in leaving funds on an exchange, where control of those funds is handed over to a third party and is only as safe as whatever security measures that exchange chooses to use.


Throughout the history of Bitcoin, hacks have amounted to painful losses. When bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox began liquidation proceedings in April 2014, the company announced that approximately 850,000 bitcoins were missing, an amount valued at more than $450 million at the time. In August 2016, the Bitcoin exchange Bitfinex announced hackers stole approximately 120,000 BTC, worth $72 million at the time.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.5106
2018/1/29,"Following Massive Cryptocurrency Hack, Coincheck Pledges to Improve Operations, Refund Losses","Following one of the largest hacks in the history of cryptocurrency, Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck has announced that it will comply with an order from Japan’s Financial Services Agency to improve its business operations.

On Friday, January 26, 2018, Coincheck was hacked, resulting in the loss over over $530 million USD worth of NEM (XEM) tokens. A full transcript of the announcement from Coincheck executives can be found here.

The core of the problem was that Coincheck was keeping the currency in a “hot” wallet, which meant the method of storage was connected to the internet. By contrast, U.S.-based Coinbase keeps 98 percent of its holdings offline in “cold” storage. The hack ranks among the largest of cryptocurrency since the launch of bitcoin. Coincheck subsequently restricted deposits and withdrawals of most currencies pending investigation and resolution of the problems.

“We earnestly accept the terms of the order and vow to re-examine our business practices while simultaneously striving to make all facts involved in this case clear, discover the root cause of the breach, safeguard our customers, and develop stronger and more effective measures for system risk management and prevention of similar events in the future.”

The exchange also announced a reparations policy yesterday, January 28, which will reimburse 523,000,000 XEM to 260,000 users.

The hack caused an immediate 20 percent drop in the price of XEM to $0.79, but it has since recovered those losses and more, rising to $1.07 within 24 hours.

Like Bitcoin, NEM is a cryptocurrency built on top of blockchain technology. Unlike bitcoin, which uses Proof of Work (PoW), NEM uses Proof of Importance (PoI) to establish consensus on the blocks. PoI uses “harvesters” in a variation of the Proof of Stake (PoS) model as opposed to miners used for PoW methods to generate tokens and does not require special computing or energy requirements to arrive at consensus. XEM is the name of the cryptocurrency associated with NEM harvesting and it is those tokens that were stolen from Coincheck.

Vice President of the NEM Foundation, Jeff McDonald, told Bitcoin Magazine, “Coincheck contacted us immediately, so we knew about the problem and had devised a plan to tag the stolen coins before the news had even hit the media. The NEM technology is fully intact, so there is no need to hard fork the code.”

McDonald said that NEM immediately reached out to the exchanges and identified 10 different accounts where most of the XEM tokens went. All of those tokens have been tagged, so anyone who is considering buying these tokens will be able to see they were stolen from the Coincheck exchange and should not accept them.

“Had Coincheck used the NEM multi-signature wallet, this could not have happened,” McDonald added. “A third-party audit would have uncovered the problems, but Coincheck was the single exchange in Japan that was not FSA licensed and illustrates the value of good governance and oversight in this space.”

Coincheck is expected to produce a written report summarizing the actions it will take to improve security and customer support by Tuesday, February 13, 2018.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.0267
2018/2/13,Cryptocurrency Exchange’s $170 Million Nano Coin Loss Sparks Outrage,"On Friday, February 9, 2018, Italian cryptocurrency exchange BitGrail announced that “internal checks revealed unauthorized transactions which led to a 17 million Nano [XRB] shortfall, an amount forming part of the wallet managed by BitGrail.” The shortfall when reported was allegedly worth $170 million and has presumably rendered BitGrail insolvent, despite the fact that the other wallets and currencies that the exchange has were purportedly untouched.

The 9:30 p.m. UTC announcement by the Florence-based exchange gives some cause for circumspection. The founder of the exchange, Francesco “The Bomber” Firano, fired off salvos on Twitter in defense of the loss. His defense rang hollow for BitGrail customers, however, as Firano had noted the problem a day prior but withheld disclosure to authorities, users and the public while trying to work through the issue with the Nano team.

The “Hack”?
When news of the lost coins broke, BitGrail released a statement citing “unauthorized transactions” that were later confirmed by Firano to be the result of a hack. However, it appears many users have taken to Twitter to accuse Firano and BitGrail of committing fraud, with some positing that withdrawals have been severely limited on the exchange for months across multiple coins while transaction fees had increased. The coins lost represent approximately 14 percent of the total outstanding value of Nano mined.

However, there is some dispute (discussed below) on what actually caused the loss of coins. Whether it was an error in the BitGrail system, a planned exit scam or a hack from outsiders, taking or keeping the ill-gotten tokens seems ill-advised. The percentage of coins taken represents five times the current daily trading volume of Nano and would require careful offloading to avoid driving the price down by selling the coins.

Any scenario in which those lost coins could be dumped prior to the Nano coin gaining greater stability and trading volume forecasts a tumultuous time for the Nano team.

Nano Coin
The Nano coin, previously known as RaiBlocks, is a coin with a low level of liquidity that only trades on a few exchanges, (previously) including BitGrail. At the time of this writing, CoinMarketCap lists the volume for the coin at $34 million over the trailing 24 hours. The XRB coin has spiked as high as $31.14 on January 2, 2018, and currently sits at $9.75. Nano hosted its first Meetup on February 6, 2018, and launched its iOS wallet in beta on February 5, 2018.

BitGrail vs. Nano
Relations between the coin and the exchange disintegrated over the weekend with Firano accusing the Nano team of libel and threatening to call the police “for irresponsible behavior,” while Nano retaliated in a “tell all” Medium post. In a de-evolution of relations, Nano core team member Zack Shapiro (in a deleted tweet to user @jsmoove08) defended BitGrail a day prior to the exchange’s announcement. The Nano team issued this announcement in response to the news. The team started with:

From our own preliminary investigation, no double spending was detected on the ledger and we have no reason to believe the loss was due to an issue in the Nano protocol. The problems appear to be related to BitGrail’s software. We had no knowledge of BitGrail’s insolvency prior to February 8th.
It concluded with this accusation:


We now have sufficient reason to believe that Firano has been misleading the Nano Core Team and the community regarding the solvency of the BitGrail exchange for a significant period of time.
Reactions from Firano were expectedly harsh, including one tweet where he stated:  


In the wake of the unfounded accusations made against me by the dev team and of the dissemination of private conversations that compromise police investigations, BitGrail s.r.l. is forced to contact the police in order to protect its rights and users.
It should be noted that the Nano team relayed through its Medium post that they would “not be responding to individual posts or accusations by Firano regarding this situation.”

As BitGrail was one of the few exchanges that had been accepting Nano, the coin is now facing trading volume declines, down from the $50 million reported by the Wall Street Journal on February 10, 2018.

Nano also linked a pdf of a private conversation between Firano and Nano core team members Shapiro and Colin LeMahieu. The chat shows Firano’s insistence that the loss of Nano was due to an issue with corrupted time/date stamps of the errant transactions and suggested the fault lay with Nano as non-Nano wallets remained intact. Shapiro and LeMahieu disputed this claim. Firano also asked if the stolen coins could be forked in order to recover the “stolen” Nano from the burned address. The dev team refused to acknowledge a fork as a possible solution.

Firano stated in the chat that he first noticed the bug eight hours prior to the conversation with Shapiro and LeMahieu. Shapiro challenged Firano’s timeline, asking, “If withdrawals have been closed for the last month, how did you not notice this? Someone with[sic] allegedly withdrawing for weeks according to you via this ‘hack.’”

Social Media Reacts
Users on social media seem to have sided with Nano on events, accepting the narrative that a bug in the javascript for the client-side interface allowed for wallets to withdrawal more coins than they had on the exchange. Others, though, were just as furious with the Nano dev team for supporting BitGrail in the weeks leading up to the loss of funds.

Regardless of fault, the turmoil caused by the loss of $170 million worth of Nano on the BitGrail exchange has left both the exchange and the dev team faced with accusations, angry customers and little recourse for those affected.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.9984
2018/3/7,Civic and Votem’s Partnership Accelerates Blockchain-Based KYC Process,"Identity verification is paramount to global freedom and citizen access to public services. We see many examples of this today in terms of how barriers to documentation adversely impact issues like democratic voting processes, especially among homeless communities and refugee settlements.

Today’s developments in blockchain technology are now enabling solutions to these and many other verification issues. The use of distributed technology shows promise as a more robust, cost-effective mechanism for advancing identity trust and governance.

Civic, a provider of blockchain identity-verification technology, recently announced a partnership with technology platform Votem to launch the first Know-Your-Customer (KYC) system powered by its CVC token. This, according to leaders at both companies, signals a major leap forward in ensuring the security and transparency of the KYC and accreditation processes.

Votem’s platform provides citizens, organizations and governments around the world with the ability to easily manage or participate in online voting. It is designed to improve the effectiveness of voting by ensuring the integrity of the process, including the confidentiality of the voters’ choices and the validity of results, for both private- and public-sector elections.

Through this partnership, Civic will provide Votem with trusted identity protocols, enabling a secure and transparent environment, without the risks and costs associated with collecting and storing personal identity information.

An Early Use Case
For Votem’s public token presale for accredited investors, which commenced on February 27, 2018, Civic is registering and authenticating the presale participants without the need for usernames and passwords. They are also verifying the identity of each person using blockchain-powered attestations.

This process begins with users storing their identity documents using the Civic app. Civic, in turn, verifies the identity of each potential participant in the Votem presale and, where necessary, conducts advanced Accredited Investor checks for users in the U.S.

Through the use of this new model, Civic’s decentralized ID verification and KYC protocol is laying the groundwork for security and professionalism in the token sale effort, ensuring that Votem’s process is secure from start to finish.

Civic CTO Jonathan Smith said, “This collaboration marks another milestone for Civic’s ecosystem and for on-demand, secure and low-cost access to identity verification services. This partnership is especially impactful, not only because it is the first CVC-powered KYC, but because Votem also falls squarely in line with Civic’s long-term vision of bringing decentralized democracy to life through blockchain technology. With Civic and Votem coming together, fair and secure digital voting starts now.”

Pete Martin, CEO of Votem, concurred: “We believe this will set a new standard for token sales and are honored to be working with them in this regard. We also think this sets the groundwork for a long-term strategic partnership around the secure and accurate authentication of voters since we share a common vision of making voting more secure, accessible and verifiable. Votem was founded to improve free and fair elections around the globe and with our partnership with Civic, we know that we have a solid partner to help us achieve our mission.”

Orchestrating the Path Forward
In a phone interview with Bitcoin Magazine, while navigating through the traffic gridlock in San Francisco, Smith said that Civic is very excited about this being the first KYC/ICO project that’s actually powered by the Civic token, a very important milestone for their platform.

“Votem has always been very close to the heart and core of our mission involving the empowerment of democracy through blockchain-based identity. This project highlights the importance of identity as a fundamental building block in which voting can occur whether in a corporate system or an international government election.”  

In light of Civic’s belief that democracy is a hugely important element in uplifting citizens, Smith noted that Civic has had conversations with various government entities throughout the world. “At the end of the day, the entity has to decide what and in whom they will trust. That’s a big thing to leap over — how do I trust the data I’ve been given? Blockchain [technology] is a much better solution in terms of facilitating a strong measure of trust in the KYC provisioning of an identity. Our partnership with Votem offers a great way to demonstrate this.”",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.9986
2018/3/16,"Civic Demos Proof of Concept With Beer Vending Machines, Launches ID Codes","Blockchain identity verification platform Civic has emerged from Consensus 2018 with clear progress and updates for its identity attestation technology.

The project imagines a network of validators and service providers who work together to verify individual identities. A new platform user would submit relevant identity information to a validation smart contract, which the validator would then review for approval. If approved, the validator would store references to this information on the blockchain, attesting to its validity. Anytime the corresponding user needs to submit identity information to another service provider (a bank, government agency, etc.), that service provider could request the validator to cross-check the user’s information with the blockchain’s attestations to verify their identity.

In practice, such an ecosystem could streamline identity verification procedures and keep its users and participating service providers from having to go through lengthy ID checks whenever the occasion arises.

Coming out of Consensus 2018, Civic is showing that it’s taking steps to turn theory into a reality. These steps include the first iteration of its ID codes protocol alongside its revamped token economy white paper, and — the kicker — the “world’s first crypto beer vending machine.”

The idea of giving out free beer may seem kitschy at first glance, but its novelty is matched by what it means for Civic’s utility. Using the Civic app, anyone verified on the platform can scan a QR code to prove that they’re of legal drinking age. In a partnership with Anheuser-Busch, Civic unveiled the vending machine at Consensus 2018, offering anyone who used it a free brew.

To Vinny Lingham, Civic’s co-founder and CEO, the campaign isn’t some flashy promotion or an excuse to crack open a cold one. It’s a way to prove that, without relinquishing any other ID information, Civic can utilize a zero-knowledge age check: a use case that could be applied to more than just alcohol purchases.

“It’s a proof of concept,” Lingham told Bitcoin Magazine in an interview. “It could be beers, weed, pharmaceuticals — lots of things that are age restricted or are limited in access for certain people.”

This proof of concept is just one of many uses for Civic’s ID protocol, the instruments responsible for such a practical application of the technology. 

Their newly released ID codes are another proven manifestation of Civic’s protocol, and according to the team, it’s the “first-ever blockchain-based verification mechanism.”

While surfing the web, anyone will be able to use these codes to verify businesses, social media profiles, team members, advisors and any individual with attested information on the blockchain per Civic’s protocol. Lingham and the Civic team built these ID codes with ICOs and cryptocurrency projects in mind, wanting to provide a digital lie detector of sorts that will allow investors to steer clear of fraudulent projects.

“One of the problems with ICOs is that all these advisors are fake, the investors are fake, the teams are fake, and so with Civic, now you can get verified,” Lingham told Bitcoin Magazine. “And you [the investor] can quickly look at the site to see whether or not the people are real.”

These ID codes are the core of Civic’s mission, the nucleus of its composition and the feature that could potentially revolutionize how we, as a society, verify information for anything from job applications to vacation planning.

“We have a ton of uses,” Lingham said. “It’s everything from verifying identities for authors, journalists, etc. … printing ID codes on your business cards, luggage tags: anywhere we want to put your ID information, or make it available to somebody, you can use a QR code from Civic.”

All of this will be facilitated using the Civic app, and what’s more, users don’t need to even own any of Civic’s tokens (CVC) to use the services.

“That’s the beauty of it. You don’t have to own a Civic token to use Civic. You just need the app.”

Still, this hasn’t kept the team from revamping its token’s utility. With the help of Newtown Partners, a blockchain investment and advisory service co-founded by Lingham, they’ve also released a fresh token-economy white paper. The team claims that using game theory mathematical models and economic incentives, the newest version reimagines Civic’s Identity Verification Marketplace. Special focus was placed on demonstrating how CVC can incentivize use and circulation without providing monetary rewards or dividends, practices that have given regulators leeway to scrutinize tokens as securities, especially those with staking rewards.

To avoid running into such regulatory roadblocks, Civic took pains to avoid any practices that might have made its token sale operate like a securities offering, such as coaxing investors with discounts and bonuses. “We looked at the way security sales are done and we did the opposite of everything they did,” Lingham explained.

Lingham believes Civic’s token model and design could serve as an example for the rest of the industry to follow. To him, the end game is a practicality and usability that doesn’t just attract big league investors and entities; it’s a platform that acts as a “consumer-focused company,” because without everyday users, the technology will never mature beyond its growing pains.

“We’re focusing on driving consumer adoption to this industry for identity and blockchain. Unless this technology gets in the hands of consumers and they can actually find practical use cases for it, it’s going to be a digital idea, not a device that gets used. So we’re very focused on engagement and building engaging experiences for users.”",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.981
2018/4/9,New “Know-Your-Transaction” Tool Enables Enhanced Blockchain Investigation,"Cryptocurrency investigation enterprise Chainalysis is releasing a product called Know Your Transaction (KYT) designed to help businesses track customers that may be involved in illicit cryptocurrency-related activity. The company’s clientele includes the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Europol.

Per a recent blog post, Chainalysis stated that it holds a lot of faith in both cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology:“Blockchains create new ways for people to build trust among themselves and transact using cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies have, in turn, inspired people to reimagine the financial machinery that powers world commerce. People are collecting land in virtual realities, conducting real-time payments for computation services, and buying collectible cats on the internet. This is just the beginning of worldwide access to financial instruments.”

The venture’s primary goal is to get banks involved in the cryptocurrency scene and to create a world where financial institutions can offer their services to digital currency exchanges and ventures, but alleged fears of money-laundering make this somewhat tricky, which explains the reasoning behind the product’s release.

Chainalysis’ KYT provides “real-time feedback” on transactions and fuels relevant information into what the company calls exchanges’ “transaction processing engines,” so executives can raise alerts regarding risky customers and monitor suspicious activity. The product has been in a testing phase amongst a small group of select customers, who reported seeing a “20X improvement in the speed of account reviews.” KYT will now be released to global cryptocurrency exchanges and financial institutions.

In addition, the company is also introducing multi-currency support. Chainalysis will start with bitcoin cash for its law enforcement customers and is looking to expand to 10 cryptocurrencies by the end of 2018.

Chainalysis recently landed approximately $16 million in series A funding from venture firm Benchmark, whose only other cryptocurrency-related investments include Pantera Capital and Xapo back in 2014.

General partner Sarah Tavel, who led the deal with Chainalysis, explained that the move was a smart choice, and called Chainalysis a “meat and potatoes” company:

“All these regulated institutions want to participate [in cryptocurrency transactions], but they need to understand with whom they are transacting and where their funds are originating. We’d solved these traditional compliance requirements in the fiat world.”

Chainalysis was founded in 2014 by Oxford economist Jonathan Levin and Michael Granger, the former COO of San Francisco-based bitcoin exchange Kraken. The company employs over 75 people and boasts offices in New York, Washington D.C. and Copenhagen.

Chainalysis rose to fame after it was selected to investigate Japan’s Mt. Gox debacle, which saw roughly half a billion dollars worth of cryptocurrency disappear practically overnight. The reported mastermind is an alleged Russian cybercrime suspect who was arrested in Greece last summer.

Chainalysis isn’t alone in this space. London-based Elliptic, which also runs investigations relating to cryptocurrencies, has garnered over $7 million in funding from institutions like Banco Santander bank and Octopus Ventures to further expand its operations and product development team.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.9223
2018/4/25,Popular Ether Wallet MEW Is Hijacked in DNS Attack,"MyEtherWallet, a popular web-based wallet for storing and transmitting the cryptocurrency ether (ETH), suffered a DNS attack that rerouted unsuspecting users to a Russian scam site into which some victims fed their login credentials.

An unsigned SSL certificate warned users before entering the phony site but some bypassed the warning, resulting in a loss of funds. MyEtherWallet confirmed the attack in a statement on April 24, 2018.

Hackers did not actually hack the MyEtherWallet platform itself but went after vulnerabilities in public-facing DNS servers instead. MyEtherWallet recommends users switch to Cloudflare DNS servers for the time being.

DNS servers provide the correct IP address for an internet site’s name. If you type in “www.myetherwallet.com,” a DNS server will translate that into the IP address for that site. An SSL certificate protects against spoofed DNS answers by comparing the hostname you enter with the hostnames listed in the certificate. If no match is found, an SSL warning pops up.

Normally when users attempt to visit myetherwallet.com, they are directed to Amazon Web Services, which hosts the site. But this time, according to cybersecurity firm CloudFlare, they were directed instead to a set of Russian IP addresses.

According to Oracle's Internet Intelligence division, the hacker was able to hijack DNS entries after executing a BGP (short for Border Gateway Protocol) route hijack that redirected internet traffic meant for Amazon servers. BGP, a routing protocol used by the internet, is known for its vulnerabilities. Most of the affected users were employing Google’s recursive DNS service.

“Little did we know this was part of an elaborate scheme to use the inherent security weaknesses of DNS and BGP to pilfer cryptocurrency, but that remarkable scenario appears to have taken place,” Oracle’s Doug Madory wrote in a blog post.

DNS hijacks are not uncommon. Earlier this year, hackers hijacked the DNS server for BlackWallet.co, a web-based wallet for the Stellar Lumens cryptocurrency, redirecting $400,000 worth of lumens (XLM) to their own server. In late 2017, EtherDelta was also the victim of a DNS hijack, resulting in the loss of at least $267,000 in funds.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.8944
2018/6/12,New Platform Answers the Question: Who's Really Behind That ICO?,"With crypto scams running rampant across the globe, Human Trust Protocol, aka Hub, is joining hands with Civic, a blockchain identification service provider, to verify users via know-your-client (KYC) data gathered from the Civic secure identity platform (SIP). The new project entitled ICO Hub is an algorithmic ICO rating service that adds identity verification as a central rating factor: Hub representatives will now be able to identify ICO project team members and organizers to ensure a platform’s authenticity before investors step in.

Launched by LinkedIn’s original CTO and co-founder Eric Ly, Hub works to establish blockchain histories and reputations by granting users blockchain-specific tokens which they can then add to a platform’s reputation data, thereby building its online market presence.

Civic seeks to grant consumers a say in whether their identities are used in real-time by providing low-cost, on-demand and secure identity verification technology that boosts transparency and legitimacy in the crypto space. Civic uses a decentralized structure with biometrics on mobile devices, and provides multi-factor authentication without usernames, passwords, physical tokens or third-party involvement.

ICO Hub is built on a specific rating system. ICOs will ultimately receive “trust scores” based on the authenticity of their organizers’ claims and users’ outcome predictions.

In a statement, founder and CEO Eric Ly explained, “At Hub, our objective is to help users develop and manage their reputation data and incentivize meaningful and authentic interactions online through our human trust protocol. Civic’s secure and private ecosystem that enables decentralized, reusable KYC is a perfect fit, and gives our protocol users another means to bolster their reputation histories.”

CTO and co-founder of Civic Jonathan Smith told Bitcoin Magazine that the Wall Street Journal recently analyzed over 1,400 digital coin offerings, and found that roughly 20 percent of them engage in some sort of fraud, from plagiarized investor documents to fake executive teams.

“Within the coin offerings analyzed by the Journal, nearly $1 billion was poured into fraudulent investments, and so far, investors have claimed losses of up to $273 million,” he states.

Both Civic and Hub believe their collaboration on ICO Hub will contribute to lasting trust in the blockchain space, boost users’ credentials on neighboring platforms, and improve transaction efficiency.

“ICO Hub is the first algorithmic ICO rating system that, unlike qualitative analysis-based rating systems, will help companies more towards self-regulation,” Smith said. “In a time where crypto projects are under constant scrutiny, it will help users stake tokens and predict the outcomes of ICO projects, instead of relying on social and github signals. Having a strong ID verification service integrated in the algorithmic evaluation will enable Hub to significantly reduce the risks related to impersonation and fake personas that have plagued ICOs and allowed fraudsters to run off with money undetected.”

Regulators have consistently worked to crackdown on fraudulent ICO projects. Last February, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a string of subpoenas to several ICO organizers, believing they were in violation of recent securities laws, and speaking with CNBC last November, Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin commented that most ICOs are fake, and have no intention of offering anything valid to their investors.

2018/7/13,"Blockchain Auditing and the Industry’s ""Knowledge Gap""","The advent of smart contracts has long drawn interest for its potential to revolutionize business agreements. There’s just one problem, and it’s one that has affected many spheres of the cryptocurrency space: a knowledge gap. This gap exists between people who specialize in conventional legal terms and contracts and those who specialize in the technological programming of the blockchain.

On a recent episode of The Tatiana Show, host Tatiana Moroz interviewed Hartej Sawhney, president and co-founder of the cybersecurity firm, Hosho. Calling in from the back of a taxi cab in Istanbul, Sawhney explained that Hosho’s business advantage has developed around overcoming the knowledge gap.

“We see ourselves as a cybersecurity company that happens to focus on the cryptocurrency/ blockchain space,” said Sawhney. “What we’ve been doing to date has been building up a team of white hat hackers, people who have a strong background in the DevCon community.” For those unfamiliar with DevCon, it is considered to be one of the world’s largest and most well known hacker convention.

Headquartered in Las Vegas, Hosho focuses on auditing smart contracts “on any blockchain” and simulating cyber attacks to test the security of different systems. In addition, Hosho is also developing other cyber securities solutions for the space such as a multi-sig wallet for Ethereum and a Telegram group bot that detects phishing scams.

Fraud and Mistakes
Smart contract auditing remains the core of Hosho’s work. “Everything to date has been mostly people taking advantage of the fundraising mechanism of an ICO on the Ethereum blockchain,” said Sawhney. Auditing means that the developers are checking to make sure a smart contract is doing what it is supposed to do.

Sawhney pointed out that auditing smart contracts has shown him that there is a knowledge gap when it comes to finding developers with competence in Solidity, the language used to write Ethereum-based smart contracts, who are then able to perform these audits. And, according to Sawhney, the other side of this problem is that those developers who are actually proficient at Solidity, for the most part, are “too rich to get out of bed.”

Hosho’s strategy for dealing with the knowledge gap is finding people with cybersecurity backgrounds and teaching them Solidity.

Essentially, to the public, projects with misfiring smart contracts fall under the category of scams.

At EthBerlin, a gathering of 7–8 of the biggest cybersecurity professionals in this space will converge to standardize what a smart contract audit entails. Given the early state of the industry, Sawhney went on to say that the gathering, while sorely needed, is also well-timed for establishing an international framework for self-governance before one is imposed by an entity outside of the industry.

While Sawhney stated that the knowledge gap is a real problem for the industry, he noted that standards were improving. “In North America, every single exchange has made it a standard to check for a professional third party audit. Asia has some catching up to do … The speed at which a cryptocurrency gets listed in Asia is a lot faster than anywhere else. This is also what makes Asia an exciting market.”

The New Standard
Hosho’s standard for a smart contract auditing consists of a full audit of the language and code in their smart contracts followed by an itemized list provided to the client of all the quandaries that Hosho has identified with its capacity to be smoothly executed.

After the client addresses the errors, Hosho provides a second audit to make sure that the contract’s code has been fixed. Once approved, Hosho, in effect, stamps the code to certify that the code has been audited by a third party: That seal is valid up until the point that the code is edited again.

Although this seal is of interest to legal teams and government officials, Sawhney pointed out that, in the majority of cases, “the one person who reads our report is the exchanges.” This emphasis on exchange approval is tantamount to making smart contract audits a standard security procedure.

Other Topics
Like Sawhney, Tatiana’s other two guests were concerned with establishing and maintaining standards within the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystems. In addition to Sawhney and his views on cybersecurity, Connie Gallippi described the journey of forming her Bitcoin nonprofit, BitGive, while Bitcoin Magazine’s managing editor, Christie Harkin, explained some of the rules for maintaining editorial objectivity in cryptocurrency journalism as well as some guidelines for successful news story pitches.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.9949
2018/7/17,Op Ed: Addressing the Threat of Cryptomining Malware,"One major class of attacks to hit the hacking landscape recently is cryptomining. While cryptomining on its own supports a good cause when being done consciously, it also allows nefarious actors to make a lot of money fast, and, with the sheer number of cryptocurrencies available to mine, it is becoming a popular choice for attackers.

The technique essentially involves an attacker taking advantage of another person’s computer and using its CPU power to mine for cryptocurrency. If the malware is configured to consume a large percentage of CPU power, it can prevent the CPU from doing other tasks and effectively deny the user access to the machine and its application.

The malware mining work is often done through mining pools, a collaborative framework which allows numerous “miners” to work together, thus increasing the amount of money the attackers can make collectively.

So what can organizations do to protect their systems against this attack?

Hitting the Target
Attackers try to exploit any publicly available interface that will allow them to carry out the attack. Such interfaces can include misconfigured services in the cloud like databases, caches, management tools like Kubernetes and more. For example, recent research from Imperva shows that 75 percent of Redis servers are infected with cryptomining malware.

Having said that, web servers remain the largest target for attacker, since they are meant to be public.In fact, cryptomining has grown so popular that, in the closing months of 2017, there was a surge in attacks, where researchers saw that 88 percent of all remote code execution attacks (RCE) sending requests to external sources were trying to download cryptomining malware on target machines.

To carry out cryptomining attacks, hackers will first look for an RCE vulnerability, which allows attackers to run arbitrary code on the vulnerable server. For example, a recent RCE vulnerability attackers used to mine cryptocurrency was related to insecure deserialization. In these types of vulnerabilities, attackers tampered with serialized objects that were sent to the web application. Then, after the object was deserialized, malicious code was run on the vulnerable server, which allowed the attacker to mine for cryptocurrency.

Cryptomining attackers use similar techniques to other attacks in terms of infection, evasion and persistency. However, in some cases, we see malware samples that try to maximize the attack, and their profit, either by spreading in the network through vulnerable devices or injecting code to the server that affects the end users.

In addition, cryptomining attacks can be a prelude to other kinds of malicious activity. If a server is infected, it usually means that it is vulnerable to some kind of a code injection. The same vulnerability that was exploited to infect the server with cryptomining malware can be reused to infect it with other malware or to launch further attacks on the attacker’s behalf. An infected end-point means that the attacker has gained a foothold in your internal network and that the attack can potentially spread to other machines in your organization.

Although bitcoin is probably the best-known and most popular cryptocurrency, attackers are not mining for bitcoin; this is not only because special hardware is required to mine for this coin, but also because bitcoin transactions are not private. This means that coins can be traced back along the transaction chain, which means attackers have a higher chance of getting caught.

As a result, attackers are instead increasingly mining for two types of coins: privacy-focused coins like Monero, and newer cryptocurrencies that require less specialized mining equipment. These alternative cryptocurrencies allow attackers to undertake transactions without the fear of it being traced back to them as an account balance cannot be seen, and the transaction does not reveal the sender, receiver or the amount transferred.

Protecting Against Cryptomining Attacks
To protect against cryptomining attacks, organization should try to reduce their attack surface as much as possible,  limit public access to their assets whenever it is possible and enforce rigid authentication processes.

Cryptomining malware usually needs a lot of computing power, thus a simple detection can be achieved by monitoring the CPU for high consumption. However, some cryptomining attacks are programmed to work under the radar. They are specifically configured not to overload the CPU, thus making them more difficult to detect.

To protect against cryptomining attacks, organizations must first ensure their systems are fully up to date with all relevant patches. In order for cryptomining to be successful, attackers must first take advantage of a vulnerability. However, if an organization is up to date with all its patches, then this entry point is sealed.

As attackers are targeting RCE vulnerabilities in web applications to launch their malware, patching is crucial. By ensuring IT teams are fully aware of— and ensuring systems are up to date with — the latest vendor patches, these kinds of vulnerabilities can be mitigated.

Alternatively, virtual patching can also be utilized to actively protect web applications from attacks. This reduces the window of exposure and decreases the cost of emergency patches and fix cycles. A web application firewall that provides virtual patching doesn’t interfere with the normal application workflow and keeps the site protected while allowing the site owners to control the patching process timeline.

Taking Action
Illicit cryptomining is an effortless way for nefarious actors to make money as it slips under the radar of victims. Plus, it is lucrative. The attack itself is simple to mount and is rapidly overtaking ransomware in becoming the most prevalent attack vector. Although some see this type of attack as simply a nuisance, cryptomining has the potential to cause large scale “brownouts,” as computer infrastructures collapse when criminals fight for compromised systems to get their hands on cryptocurrencies.

2018/8/2,Audits and Quality Assurance: Patching the Holes in Smart Contract Security,"On July 10, 2018, news broke that cryptocurrency wallet and decentralized exchange Bancor was hit with a hack. A wallet the Bancor team used to update the protocol’s smart contracts was infiltrated, and the $23.5 million vulnerability allowed the hackers to run off with $12.5 million ETH, $1 million NPXS tokens and $10 million of Bancor’s BNT token.

Following the hack, the Bancor team froze the BNT in question in an effort to stanch its losses.

The latest of its kind, the attack is an unfortunate reminder that smart contracts are not foolproof. Even built as they are on the blockchain’s security intensive network, they can feature bugs, backdoors and vulnerabilities that are ripe for exploitation.

Before Bancor, we saw the popular Ethereum wallet Parity drained of 150,000 ETH (now worth just over $68 million) in July of 2017. In November of the same year, Parity lost even more than this when a less-experienced coder accidentally froze some $153 million worth of ether and other tokens.

In perhaps the most infamous smart contract hack in the industry to date, The DAO, a decentralized venture fund, lost 3.6 million ether in June of 2016. The stolen funds are now worth $1.6 billion, and the fallout of the attack saw Ethereum hard fork to recoup losses.

The Why and How: Making the Same Mistake
If three’s company, then The DAO, Parity and now Bancor have become the poster triplets of smart contract vulnerabilities. But they’re not alone in their weakness, and similar smart contract bugs have been exploited or nearly exploited on other networks.

For such a nascent technology, such flaws may be expected, but given the mass sum of funds these contracts are supposed to protect, truly stalwart security measures are not yet routinely employed.

To Hartej Sawhney, co-founder of Hosho cybersecurity firm, the sheer amount of funds at stake is enough of an incentive to attract black hats to these smart contracts, especially if there’s a central point through which they can probe for access.

“There’s money behind every smart contract, so there’s an incentive to hack into it. And the scary part of smart contracts like Bancor is that they’ve coded their smart contracts in a way that gives centralized power to the founders of the project. They’ve put this backdoor in there,” Sawhney told Bitcoin Magazine in an interview.

Sawhney is referring to Bancor’s ability to confiscate and freeze tokens at will, as the smart contracts that govern their wallet and exchange feature central points of control. This degree of control has been widely criticized as centralized to the point that Bancor shouldn’t be able to advertise itself as a decentralized exchange.

And it may have even provided the hackers with an entry point into the network. While Bancor has not revealed the specifics of the hack and its execution, the team wrote in a blog post that “a wallet used to upgrade some smart contracts was compromised.” Sawhney indicated in our interview that “most smart contracts are coded to be irreversible,” while Bancor’s own are completely mutable. The hackers could have exploited — and likely did exploit — the same backdoor that the developers put into place to manage their project.

Bancor aside, Dmytro Budorin, CEO of cybersecurity community Hacken, echoed Sawhney’s belief that the industry’s treasure trove of assets is a powerful impetus for hackers to dirty their hands. He also believes that the relative youth of the technology makes it vulnerable to detrimental exploits.

“Coding on blockchain is something new,” Budorin added in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. “We still lack security standards and best practices on how to properly code smart contracts. Also, when coding smart contracts, programmers think more about functionality than about security, since a programmer’s main task is to simply make the code work, and security is usually an afterthought.”

Working with new programming languages, security can take a back seat to functionality. More than just the casualty of a steep learning curve, Sawhney believes that security can slip by the eye of software engineers because they “don’t have a quality assurance (QA) mindset.”

With millions at stake and potential holes in the code to exploit, hackers are bound to drum up a scheme to breach these contracts, according to Budorin. Even if a team has audited their code for expected or known vulnerabilities, “a new type of attack can be developed any time and nothing can protect you from this.”

All it takes is a spurt of intuitive thinking to probe a smart contract’s code for an unexplored opening, Amy Wan, CEO and co-founder of Sagewise, iterated in a separate interview with Bitcoin Magazine.

“It is not often that developers are able to write perfect code that works the first time around — and even when that happens the code cannot be adapted to unforeseen situations. Code is also static, which makes smart contracts very rigid. However, humans are anything but static and very creative when it comes to problem solving. This combination creates something of a perfect storm, making smart contracts ill-suited where there are bugs in coding or loopholes/situation changes.”

Wan believes that “technology isn't about tech itself as much as it is about how humans interact with it,” meaning that we “are always going to have folks looking for opportunities to test the shortcomings of technology, which may result in hacks.”

To Wan, smart contracts feature intrinsic vulnerabilities. To make security matters worse, she also holds that they “cannot be amended or terminated (or in technologist speak, evolved or upgraded),” and their static nature renders them susceptible to the dynamic, adaptive strategies of black hats.

“Code aside, with every situation, there are an infinite number of things that can go awry. The rigidity of smart contracts presently cannot accommodate the fluidity of the real world,” she said.

Mending the Achilles Heel
If technical flexibility is the crux of smart contract weakness, then the fix is in the inception and carry-through of their development. Developers should put preventative measures in place to ensure that their code can bend without breaking, the CEOs expressed.

“We need to have a more comprehensive approach in order to solve this problem in the long term,” Budorin argued. “First of all, even though it is impossible to make all contracts absolutely secure, smart contract risks can be reduced. The best way to secure a smart contract is to have a security engineer on staff, conduct two different independent audits, and launch a bug bounty program for a dedicated period of time before deployment.”

Hacken itself facilitates such bug bounties, and the platform, called HackenProof, has seen its white hat community audit and test such industry projects as VeChainThor, Neverdie, Legolas Exchange, NapoleonX, Shopin and Enecuum. Budorin and his team find that bug bounties provide a reliable if tertiary buffer for projects before they go public.

“We believe that the only efficient way to mitigate modern cybersecurity threats is to host bug bounty programs on bug bounty platforms. This is called a crowdsourced security approach,” Budorin explained.

“Bug bounty platforms attract a crowd of third-party cybersecurity experts (dozens if not hundreds at a time) to test the client’s software. Testing can be ongoing for months or even years.”

Sawhney agrees that projects need to house more on-staff security experts to police vulnerabilities, while lamenting the fact that some projects lack a CIO or CTO for this effect. But he also indicated that, in some cases, companies need only to submit themselves to a proper audit to avoid a fate similar to Bancor’s.

“Some of these companies believe that they have the world’s best engineers, so they think they don’t need an audit. And if they get one, chances are they’ve done a third-party audit that was in their favor. Even if they’re getting an audit, some of these audit companies aren’t doing what we deem to be a professional audit. They’re taking the code and putting it through automated tooling. They’re not taking the time to do some of the more manual tasks which includes a dynamic analysis, quality assurance,” he explained.

The manual tasks that Sawhney lauds are at the heart of Hosho’s own auditing processes. They allow Hosho’s team to sniff out coding errors that automated tooling might miss, like discrepancies between the smart contract’s token algorithms and a white paper’s business model.

“So the most manual part of conducting an audit is marrying the code to the words — we call it dynamic analysis. Most of the time when we find errors with a smart contract, we’re finding colossal errors in the business logic. We’re finding everything from mathematical errors to errors in token allocation,” Sawhney said.

He went on to reveal that Hosho’s team includes professionals “from the infosec, defcon communities that are white hats who have spent years doing QA.” QA, shorthand for quality assurance, is a method by which coders test a code for its designed function to check for any malfunctions, defects and other flaws that may render it vulnerable or inoperable.

As Sawhney indicated earlier, part of the reason these projects and their auditors don’t do QA is simply because they lack the professional experience to do so. It’s easier, he claimed, to teach Solidity (a smart contract coding language) to those who know how to conduct sound QA than the other way around.

When lack of QA training or a learning curve isn’t the issue, however, Sawhney suggested that, at times, projects won’t secure a thorough audit because they’re simply cutting corners.

“Sometimes I think it’s sheer laziness and being cheap. They see that cost to code a smart contract was only $10k and [an auditor] is charging $30k to review it. They say, ‘Nah, we don’t need that. We have the best engineers in the world so we’re good.’”

To Sawhney, there’s no substitute for a thorough audit. He also holds that, once an audit has been completed, the smart contract should come with a seal of approval, one that both attests to the audit’s quality and reassures users that no code has been altered after the fact. For Hosho’s work, this comes in the form of a GPG file, a cryptographic stamp that simultaneously functions like a certificate of authenticity and denotes the final (or at least most recent) version of audited code, acting rather like the seal on a bottle of cough syrup that proves it hasn’t been tampered with since it last passed quality control.

“Having central governments, regulators, lawyers, PR firms, investors, token holders — everyone — looking for this GPG file, this sign of approval [answers the question]: Has this code been sealed? Because we can monitor this code once we’ve put this seal on it to prove that no one has touched this code, not one line of this code has been changed since a third party audited it. If code changes you’re opening up room for security vulnerabilities.”

Wan’s own solution offers a different sort of prescription, in that she adds post-audit safety nets like Sagewise’s software as a smart contract’s third line of defense.

“Going forward, I believe that blockchain companies will be able to prevent smart contract disasters by using a smart contract developer whose sole focus is developing smart contracts, hiring a reputable security auditing firm, and including a catch-all safety net into smart contracts, such as Sagewise's SDK.”

The Sagewise SDK integrates with smart contracts to police malicious inputs. It gives developers the chance to freeze the smart contract in question and adjust it accordingly.

“It starts with a monitoring and notification service so users are aware of what's happening with their smart contract. Paired with our SDK, which basically acts as an arbitration clause in code, users are notified of functions executing on their smart contract and, if such functions are unintended, [they have] the ability to freeze the smart contract. They then can take the time they need to fix whatever needs to be fixed, whether that's merely fixing a coding error to amending the smart contract or resolving a dispute,” she said.

A Community Problem, a Community Solution
In our interview, Wan claimed that “[less than] 2 percent of the population is able to read code.” Fewer people still are able to read Solidity, let alone at the level needed to insulate it with airtight security features.

So even if projects and companies want to take the measures necessary to vet and protect their code properly, they may be wanting for talent and resources. This problem will likely be educated out of existence as more software engineers develop a thorough, more sophisticated understanding of Solidity and other smart contract programming languages. More mature coding languages may present a solution to this ailment, as well.

But for the time being, the community can help developers and teams to err on the side of caution. Like an arbiter with skin in the game, people using these services need to step up and demand action and change, Wan believes. Otherwise these types of security breaches will continue to happen.

“[B]ecause much of the population cannot read code, it is difficult for them to hold developers accountable for when they do things like code an administrative backdoor into their smart contract (which many large projects have done),” said Wan.

“Just in 2017 alone, half a billion dollars in value was lost in smart contracts, but that apparently has not been enough to get developers to consider adding additional safety nets or community members to demand them. Perhaps we will need to lose billions more to get people to realize that this isn't how the system should work.”

Sawhney also reiterated this point: “[More] people need to be outspoken, call people out. I think people are scared because the community is tight-knit and everybody knows everybody. No one wants to shun people. There’s not enough self-governance in this space, and I think that’s the biggest step this community needs to take.”

He added, “[not] enough pressure [is] being put on security; there’s not enough regulation around security.”

In an effort to bring self-regulation to the forefront of the industry’s to do list, Hosho will partake in a summit for cybersecurity firms in Berlin. Slated for this September, Sawhney hopes that ETHBerlin will spawn a self-regulatory organization (SRO) from its attendence, “complete with a certificate for our work, kind of like the Big Four for financial audits.”

Adding to the conversation on self-regulation, Budorin finds that the community would do well to document exploited vulnerabilities. This would create a library of case studies and situations for developers to study and to create the solutions necessary to avoid the same pitfalls in the future.

“...the blockchain community needs to collect, store and analyze all known vulnerabilities that have been found in smart contracts and host regular security conferences that will cover security issues in blockchain and develop security guidelines so that new generation of blockchain programmers is more prepared for these problems,” he said.

Both Hacken and Hosho are answering Budorin's call for security-centric conferences. Hacken is hosting HackIT from October 8-11, a cybersecurity conference that ""is all about bringing hackers and [the] crypto community together."" In the same vein and in the same month, Hosho will host  HoshoCon, one of the first conferences to focus on blockchain cybersecurity. From October 9-11, 2018, community members will come together in Las Vegas, Nevada to listen to, learn from and discuss with each other what the industry could be doing better to bolster its security. 

While working toward proper security is a community effort, the onus is not on the community alone, as the lion’s share of responsibility rests on developers to ensure that their code is as sound as possible before reaching an audience. Together, however, the industry’s community and its architects may combine perspectives to make smart contract hazards an issue of yesterdays.

Until then, Sawhney, Budorin and Wan’s perspectives — and their respective companies’ purposes — provide a healthy reality check for the industry’s pain points. For mainstream adoption and acceptance, these points need be addressed if there is to be any sort of sustained sense of confidence in this new technology.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.7579
2018/8/3,Breeze Wallet with Breeze Privacy Protocol Mainnet Now Available for Download,"The Breeze Wallet with the Breeze Privacy Protocol public mainnet has been released and is now open to the public. The wallet showcases Stratis technology — a platform built for visual basic apps and blockchain solutions — and places heavy emphasis on both privacy and security for businesses seeking to implement business-to-business (B2B) transactions on the Stratis and Bitcoin blockchain networks.

The Breeze Wallet was first scheduled for release in mid-2017. Designed as a bitcoin wallet for desktops, the application would come with TumbleBit — a promising privacy advancement built on top of Bitcoin — and give customers the opportunity to mix their coins without the need to trust one another or the receiving wallets.

Speaking with Bitcoin Magazine last year, Stratis Founder and CEO Chris Trew explained, “We are integrating TumbleBit because it’s a trustless and secure solution that works with Bitcoin without any forks.”

Based in the U.K., Stratis is a startup that offers end-to-end solutions for development, testing and deployment of blockchain applications. Aside from maintaining its own blockchain, Stratis also boasts a native token, the Stratis token, and builds tools for existing blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin.

Developers claim the wallet boasts a user-friendly interface, along with what they dub the Masternode Client Discovery protocol, in which the Bitcoin or Stratis blockchain is used to discover, validate and connect to a Stratis Masternode. The process is decentralized and occurs through a trustless environment that is less vulnerable to network disruption.

Users employing the wallet can “obfuscate” transactions, meaning they can render them obscure or unintelligible. This primarily works for ventures or individuals seeking to conduct on-chain business while preventing that business from being viewed by the public. If a company receives regular payments from customers or makes payments to a supplier, this would be deemed commercially sensitive information and would thus be shielded.

Companies can also utilize the wallet to connect to a Stratis Masternode, thereby giving their transactions added protection across both the Bitcoin and Stratis networks. This is primarily done through TumbleBit, which provides anonymity by allowing several people to utilize the same payment channels. The channels are then protected with cryptographic puzzles that prevent any non-users from gaining access to the information they present.

The Breeze Wallet is compatible with Windows 64-bit and 32-bit, along with Mac OS X and Ubuntu.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.9612
2018/8/29,The Anatomy of Anonymity: How Dandelion Could Make Bitcoin More Private,"Many people know bitcoin as an anonymous digital currency, one whose privacy features prime it for concealed payments in sketchy recesses of the internet’s dark web.

These same people would likely be surprised to learn that bitcoin is far from anonymous. More pseudonymous than anything, its underlying technology, the blockchain, actually features a number of technical windows through which users could peep another user’s identity. These interested parties, be they analytics companies, governments or anyone with sufficient IT knowledge, can use peer-to-peer network analysis to link a Bitcoin public address to an IP address, allowing them to learn who owns a wallet and who they’re sending their funds to.

In tracing transactions and public addresses back to their users’ IP addresses, these “spies,” also known as “adversaries,” are effectively deanonymizing users. An obvious breach of privacy, the Bitcoin community has long wrestled with solutions to neutralize this problem.

Entering the conversation is Dandelion, a protocol developed by Giulia Fanti along with Shaileshh Bojja Venkatakrishnan, Surya Bakshi, Bradley Denby, Shruti Bhargava, Andrew Miller and Pramod Viswanath, researchers at Carnegie Mellon, MIT and the University of Illinois. If theory can hold up in application, Dandelion would effectively neutralize the peer-to-peer analysis that plays a significant role in compromising user identity.

The Problem
Whenever someone sends a transaction on Bitcoin’s network, typically, that transaction is broadcasted to multiple nodes until it is picked up by a miner and included in a block.

This broadcasting process is known as diffusion. It begins when the source node, the node that creates the transaction, transmits it to other nodes on the network. Once this node broadcasts the transaction, each of the other nodes that make up the network continues to independently diffuse the transaction by sending it to others with exponential delays.

Presenting Dandelion at the Building on Bitcoin conference in Lisbon, Portugal, Giulia Fanti explained that the source node’s IP address can often be discerned because “diffusion is susceptible to detection.” When collaborating spy nodes receive a transaction, they can engage in peer-to-peer network analysis to retrace its steps through the network.

Basically, by observing the timing of each broadcast and examining the structure of relays, spies can trace — with a high probability that isn’t necessarily foolproof — a transaction back to its source node. From here, the spy has high odds of gleaning the IP address of the transaction sender.

Dandelion’s Solution
Dandelion aims to abstract the transaction relaying process to make it more complicated for adversaries to trace transactions. This would, in essence, make it nearly impossible to follow the breadcrumb trail that broadcast timings and relay structures lead back to the source node that originally transmitted the transaction.

To achieve this, Dandelion sends the transaction on a random path through a variable number of nodes before the transaction is diffused across the whole network. The random pathway is known as the stem phase of the protocol, as transactions relayed in the stage are shared only between one another, transmitting from one node to the next. The diffusion phase is known as the “fluff phase,” as the transaction is broadcasted to multiple nodes to be spread across the network (visually and in effect, both of these processes replicate a Dandelion’s anatomy, hence the terminology).In the stem phase, each node randomly decides to either continue the stem phase by relaying the broadcast to another node or diffuse the transaction to the rest of the network. If passed on, the next node again randomly decides whether to pass the transaction on or diffuse it. The transaction is passed along, one by one, until one node triggers the diffusion process.

Adding the first transaction phase before diffusion is meant to provide an added layer of anonymity to the transaction broadcasting process. If the network passes the transaction to multiple potential source nodes before diffusion, this should, in theory, obfuscate where a broadcast came from, thereby making it exceedingly difficult to definitively trace a transaction back to its source.

Dandelion’s Growth
Dandelion’s proposal is considered to be a feasible step toward solving Bitcoin’s anonymity question that doesn’t involve overhauling its code entirely to outfit it with the kind of peer-to-peer network obfuscation tools a coin like Monero is developing, for example.

The team is often asked why it won’t implement the same onion routing that Monero is focusing on. Fanti admitted in her talk that “Monero is addressing the exact same problem [Dandelion] is trying to solve,” but qualified this by stating that “implementing this is actually really time intensive,” as the Monero development team has been working on it since 2014.

Focusing instead on its own ground-up approach, Dandelion has come some way since it was first introduced in 2017. After a peer review of its code found some glaring holes, the team revamped their efforts and re-released a new white paper with an updated method (known as Dandelion++) in May of 2018.

It’s expected that Dandelion will be implemented into a future Bitcoin Core update, though it will not be ready for the forthcoming 0.17.0 release.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.7564
2018/8/30,Origin Protocol Launches Decentralized Messaging Platform,"Origin Protocol , one of the early initial token offerings listed on CoinList, has announced the launch of its new decentralized messaging service. Origin’s latest offering could challenge encrypted giant Telegram, which, while not decentralized, is widely used within the cryptocurrency community.

Decentralized Options for Origin Participants
Origin Messaging was designed to meet the need for a decentralized messaging system, not only for Origin, but for the entire ecosystem. The team believes this is a core service to their marketplace. In their words:

“Messaging is [a] critical component necessary to facilitate meaningful transactions [between users].”

Speaking with Bitcoin Magazine, Origin Co-founder Josh Fraser said the company is built on the belief that “buyers and sellers” should be able to “transact without rent-seeking middlemen.”

He continued, “When you cut out the middleman, you also remove their fees, and both the buyer and the seller are able to get a better price. We’re passionate about promoting free and transparent commerce and giving our community a stake in the network.”

The team has expressed confidence that a decentralized, encrypted, real-time service will best suit users. The Origin Messaging service was designed by leading research and development engineer Yu Pan, who is a co-founder of PayPal and a top engineer at YouTube.

Origin engineer Micah Alcorn outlined the features in Origin’s blog post. These include an open-source framework and secure, end-to-end encryption. According to him, user privacy is paramount, and no one — including Origin and the National Security Agency (NSA) — should have the ability to eavesdrop on user conversations.

The platform is also fully decentralized, built on top of OrbitDB, which is a serverless, distributed, peer-to-peer database that uses IPFS as its data storage and IPFS pubsub to automatically synchronize databases with peers. Furthermore, it is entirely free because though it leverages Ethereum’s infrastructure and signing capabilities, no messages are published to the Ethereum blockchain, which means there are no associated gas fees.

He also lists speed, auditability, ease of use and anonymity as useful features of the new platform. Interestingly, the Origin dApp is ERC-725 compatible, which means users can create non-fungible assets that are used to verify the authenticity of the message recipient’s identity.

According to Origin, “ERC-725 gives you a smart contract that you alone control. This smart contract represents your identity on the blockchain. You can attach as much identifying information to your identity smart contract as you want. You can also get attestations from other trusted third-parties like Origin that verify specific aspects of your identity and add those to your identity smart contract. You can see an example of this in action in the Origin dApp where Origin will verify information like your email address, phone number and Facebook account. After Origin verifies that you control those accounts, we will sign an attestation on your behalf that you can attach to your identity smart contract.”

Of course, users also have the option to include no identifying information at all and choose to be known as nothing but an Ethereum address.

Origin is not the first cryptocurrency project to pitch a decentralized messaging service. Obsidian, a fork of Stratis, for example, has launched its own decentralized messaging platform. Popular messaging app Telegram also had plans to decentralize its services by launching an ICO, though it took a step back from this plan in May of 2018 by canceling the public portion of its fundraising.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.9979
2018/9/5,ShapeShift Will Now Require “Basic Personal Details” for New Membership Program,"In a what appears to be a seismic shift in company ethos, digital assets platform ShapeShift has launched a new loyalty program called ""ShapeShift Membership"" which will require the exchange users to provide ""basic personal details,"" according to a blog post published September 4, 2018.

In his post, ShapeShift Founder and CEO Erik Voorhees said that the membership is part of a “loyalty program"" that will see the platform collect personal information from its users while rewarding them with a range of benefits, including higher trading limits, cheaper fees, early access to new coins and more.

While ShapeShift has long been known as ""the exchange without accounts,"" with a model established to ""reduce friction and protect customers,"" this pivot seems to move away from the hands-off ideals that have distinguished it from other cryptocurrency exchanges.

Voorhees said the change was influenced by three key factors, namely, user requests, an increasing interest in tokenization and regulatory hurdles, the latter of which, the founder claims, requires the exchange to be ""prudent and thoughtful"" in its approach.

Regulatory authorities across the world have become firm with exchanges, as most countries now require digital asset platforms to comply with know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) laws before operating in the region.

On the issue of privacy, Voorhees said his exchange still believes in the ""right to financial privacy,"" which he believes is a ""foundational element of a civil and just society.""

""We still firmly believe that individuals, regardless of their race, religion, or nationality, deserve the right to financial privacy, just as they deserve the right to privacy in their thoughts, in their relationships, and in their communications. Such privacy is a foundational element of a civil and just society, and should be defended by all good people. We remain committed to that cause, and it is best served if we are smart about our approach.""

The membership program is currently optional, but there are plans to make it mandatory later this year. ShapeShift has set the wheels in motion to become an account-based exchange, but Voorhees assures users the firm has no plan to change its ""non-custodial model,"" meaning customers will still have direct control and ownership over their funds.

As ShapeShift’s concessions demonstrate, financial privacy, a long-standing tenet for the crypto community, is gradually being eroded as platforms are forced to play it safe by aligning with regulators.

Government agencies, analytics companies and other interested parties — let’s call them “spies” — have ways to analyze the public blockchains and peer-to-peer networks of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, to cluster addresses and tie them to IP addresses or other identifying information.

Unsatisfied with Bitcoin’s privacy features, several cryptocurrency projects have, over the years, launched with the specific goal to improve on them. And not without success. Several of these privacycoins are among the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market today.

However, as detailed in this month’s cover story, Bitcoin’s privacy features have recently seen significant improvements as well and are set to further improve over the next months and years. This miniseries will compare different privacycoins to the privacy offered by Bitcoin.

In part one: Dash.

Background
Dash (DASH) is among the most popular but also the more controversial cryptocurrencies in the space today.

Originally a codebase fork from Litecoin (which is in turn a codebase fork of Bitcoin), Dash was launched by its founder Evan Duffield in January 2014 as Xcoin. The project was quickly rebranded to Darkcoin, seemingly in reference to Dark Wallet, a now-defunct, privacy-focused bitcoin wallet project. Darkcoin rebranded a second time in early 2015, to the current name Dash, which stands for ""digital cash.” At the time of writing, Dash claims a 12th spot on the cryptocurrency market cap lists, down from a top five spot for some time in early 2017.

Much of the controversy surrounding Dash stems from the early days of the project. While the coin was not premined, it was instamined. As the cryptocurrency went live, miners created 2 million coins in a matter of days. Quite a significant amount, with a projected supply currently scheduled for a total of 22 million, and some 8 million coins in circulation today. According to Duffield, himself one of the early miners, the instamine was an accident. But instead of fixing the problem — for example, by changing the protocol rules or relaunching — it was decided that the coin would continue despite the instamine.

Since then, Dash has turned into (what it calls) a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, and prides itself on being the first successful example of such an organization. The DAO centers around Dash “masternodes” — DASH nodes that stake (proof of ownership) at least 1000 DASH — and should help the network in certain ways, for instance by confirming “instant transactions.” In return, these masternodes receive 45 percent of newly generated DASH.

Another 10 percent of every block reward is reserved for the Dash treasury. What happens with these funds is decided by the masternodes by vote. In practice, this money funds the Dash Core Group, effectively the company behind Dash, today headed by CEO Ryan Taylor.

Additionally, this part of the block reward funds various forms of promotion of Dash but also some external projects, including Arizona State University's Blockchain Research Laboratory, a legal cannabis industry payments platform, and several initiatives in emerging markets.

While once specifically marketed as a privacycoin, in recent years Dash did shift the focus of its pitch. Although privacy is still prominently featured on the Dash website and promotional material, it also emphasizes ease of use and low costs, apparently geared toward mainstream adoption. As a particularly notable deviation from its privacy-focused past, Dash even established a partnership with blockchain analytics company Coinfirm. While details about this partnership and the implications of it remain somewhat unclear, it’s not hard to see how this partnership is an odd fit for a coin previously known as Darkcoin.

Which brings us to these privacy features.

Privacy
Dash actually offers one particular privacy feature, called Private Send. The Private Send feature is conveniently offered in a drop-down menu of the Dash Core full node client and in other Dash wallets.

Private Send is really an implementation of CoinJoin, the privacy solution first proposed for Bitcoin by Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell. In Private Send, three users add their coins together in one big transaction, that sends the coins to freshly generated addresses belonging to the same three users. As such, the coins are effectively mixed between the three participants, breaking the blockchain trail of ownership between them. This process can be automatically repeated up to eight times, with (hopefully) different mixing participants, for extra privacy.

Like any CoinJoin solution, Private Send does require someone to construct the CoinJoin transaction. This is done using Dash’s masternode system. Dash users that wish to mix their coins contact a random masternode, which then collects the coins from the different users, and mashes them together in the CoinJoin transaction. It’s important to note that the masternode cannot steal the coins.

However, it does mean that Dash users must trust the masternodes with their privacy. After all, the mixing masternodes can link the sending and receiving addresses together; they know exactly which coins are going where. If these masternodes are run by spies or share their information with spies (on purpose or by accident), the Dash users gain less than nothing: They don’t have privacy, while revealing that they would have liked to have privacy.

Granted, if a Dash user mixes his coins more than once, the odds should decrease that all mixing masternodes leak this information.* However, to optimize uptime (and collect block rewards), many masternodes appear to be run from virtual private servers that could be compromised relatively easily in one go, for example by government-sponsored spies. Further, many masternodes could be controlled by the same people (keep in mind that some 25 percent of all coins were mined in the first week), which means switching between them might not even help that much.

It’s also worth noting that Private Send does require users to take the specific step of mixing, which in turn requires time, effort and comes with a (modest) fee. As such, only users who care about privacy are likely to partake in the mixing process; users who feel they have nothing to hide will not. This has the potential downside that mixing itself could be considered suspect. And while the trail of ownership is broken on the blockchain, the history of mixing is still visible.

Bitcoin
But perhaps most importantly, CoinJoin is not really unique. The technology was not only first proposed on Bitcoin, it is also available on Bitcoin. The most notable and powerful CoinJoin solution available today is Chaumian CoinJoin, which is embedded in the ZeroLink framework, which is, in turn, implemented in the Wasabi Wallet as well as the Bob Wallet and announced for Samourai Wallet.

Similar to Private Send, ZeroLink lets users add their coins together in one big transaction, which sends all these coins to freshly generated addresses belonging to the same users. But importantly, and unlike Private Send, the mixer is in this case unable to link the sending and receiving addresses. Clever cryptography helps break the link, without needing to trust anyone.

While Dash does, with its GUI-interface, offer a more user-friendly CoinJoin solution at this point time, the privacy guarantees are weaker than on Bitcoin — never mind serious contenders like Monero or Zcash. Needless to say, for a cryptocurrency that is, or at least was, promoted as a privacycoin, this is quite disappointing.

Or as Maxwell — whose very own CoinJoin invention is used for Private Send — once described Dash’s privacy features: LOL.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.3818
2018/9/18,Battle of the Privacycoins: Verge Offers Little Privacy and Nothing Unique,"Based on blockchain technology, most cryptocurrencies have an open and public ledger. While this is required for these systems to work, it comes with a significant downside: Privacy is often quite limited. Government agencies, analytics companies and other interested parties — let’s call them “spies” — have ways to analyze the public blockchains and peer-to-peer networks of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, to cluster addresses and tie them to IP addresses or other identifying information.

In part 3: Verge

Background
Verge (XVG) was originally launched in 2014 as “Dogecoin Dark” by Justin Sunerok, who is still lead developer of the project today. To cultivate a more serious image, the project rebranded to “Verge” in 2016. As a codebase fork of Dogecoin, its base protocol is similar to Bitcoin in many ways. (Dogecoin was a codebase fork of Litecoin, which was a codebase fork of Bitcoin.)

Verge has been in the news several times over the past year, most notoriously because the coin was successfully 51%-attacked on multiple occasions. But Verge is probably best known for its partnership with major porn site Pornhub, which made headlines all over the crypto media and beyond.

At the time of writing, Verge (XVG) claims the 39th spot on altcoin market cap lists, down from a top-25 spot earlier this year. This makes it the fourth (and last) privacy-focused altcoin in the market cap top 50, after Monero, Dash and Zcash.

Privacy
According to the subtitle of the the Verge “Black Paper,” which describes the project, Verge is “the most privacy focused cryptocurrency.” However, even the Verge project leaders themselves appear to be a bit more equivocal on this point. Describing (what seems to refer to) Monero as “too private,” the Verge Currency Beginner’s Guide written and published by Verge Currency Core members instead argues that privacy should be optional.

This optionality is represented by Verge’s “Wraith protocol.” The Wraith protocol would let users choose whether they want to conduct a regular transaction (like a normal Bitcoin transaction) or a RingCT transaction, similar to Monero. RingCT transactions include “decoy” coins in transactions to obfuscate which coin is really being spent and also hides the amounts involved in a transaction for everyone but the payer and payee.

However, RingCT transactions have actually not yet been implemented at this point in time. As such, Verge users can only make regular transactions.

What has been implemented are optional stealth addresses. Stealth addresses are perhaps best understood as cryptographic puzzles. They essentially allow the sender of XVG to generate a brand new Verge address to send the XVG to, which can then be claimed by the owner (and only by the owner) of the stealth address. The main benefits are that several Verge addresses can be generated from the same stealth address and that the stealth address cannot be linked to the actual addresses on the blockchain by anyone but the payer and the payee. This means that the stealth address can be posted online, perhaps as a donation address, without the user needing to worry about his privacy.

But Verge’s main privacy offering is probably a very different type of privacy: privacy on the peer-to-peer network layer.

The peer-to-peer network, of course, is where nodes transmit and relay all transactions and blocks to one another. Unfortunately, this network can be spied on, specifically by deploying nodes to track the data it receives from other nodes. If done right, this information can be used to figure out where certain transactions originated. If spies can link this originating node to an IP address, they’ve gone a long way toward de-anonymizing the creator of a transaction.

Verge counters peer-to-peer network analysis by having nodes and wallets communicate through Tor. By transmitting their transactions through the privacy-preserving, onion routing network, Verge users escape the prying eye of the spy. Tor is integrated into different Verge wallets by default, even including a mobile wallet for Android.

Bitcoin
Since RingCT isn’t delivered yet, the only privacy features offered by Verge today are stealth addresses and Tor.

Of these, only stealth addresses counter blockchain analysis — to some extent. This is a good feature, especially for some specific use cases (like donation addresses). But it is also a bit limited. Besides, simply generating a new (regular) address for each payment (which is standard in many Bitcoin wallets and also possible on Verge) and not sharing this address with anyone but the payer (which shouldn’t be too difficult) offers similar privacy in most cases. Further, stealth addresses are also available for Bitcoin (via Samourai Wallet).

As such, Verge’s only real differentiator would have to be Tor integration. This is a well-established solution to counter network analysis, and the fact that Verge offers it by default is good from a privacy standpoint — though Tor can slow the network down a bit.

However, Verge isn’t really unique in this regard either. Bitcoin can also be used over Tor, as can other cryptocurrencies. Granted, this does sometimes require some technical knack, which not everyone has. Verge offers a more user-friendly experience in this regard.

Bitcoin is likely to adopt Dandelion, a recent proposal to counter network analysis. This solution doesn’t encrypt all network traffic like Tor does, but it uses a clever trick to obfuscate the source of transactions that goes a long way to achieve the same goal with less overhead. That said, Dandelion is not implemented yet.

The much bigger problem for Verge is that network analysis is only one strategy to de-anonymize cryptocurrency users. And it’s almost certainly not the main one: blockchain analysis probably offers spies much more de-anonymizing data. As long as some addresses can be linked to real-world identities, address clustering tools can go a long way toward breaking all user privacy. In a world where a large chunk of all transactions are to and from KYC/AML compliant exchanges, protecting privacy on the peer-to-peer network alone probably doesn’t achieve much at all.

Thus, at least until RingCT is implemented, Verge can not reasonably be considered a privacycoin on par with Monero, Zcash or even Bitcoin — if it can be considered a privacycoin in the first place. It is definitely not “the most privacy focused cryptocurrency.”",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.3818
2018/9/20,"In First Half of 2018, Japan Counts $540 Million Lost to Crypto Thefts","When Tokyo-based Mt. Gox got hacked to the tune of 650,000 bitcoin in 2014, Japan learned early on the tough lessons of cryptocurrency theft. Yet, to this day, despite the country’s ongoing efforts to educate investors and ramp up oversight of crypto exchanges, it still feels the sting of hackers.

On September 20, 2018, on the heels of the Osaka-based Zaif heist, which amounted to $60 million in losses, the country’s National Police Agency (NPA) issued a report of cryptocurrency thefts involving exchanges and individual crypto wallets for the first half of 2018. Japanese news outlet Asahi Shimbun was the first to report on the information.

According to police authorities, during the first six months of 2018, cyber thieves made off with a startling 60.503 billion yen ($540 million) in cryptocurrency. Of the stolen money, 58 billion yen came from exchanges, while the remaining 2.5 billion yen was taken from individual crypto wallets.

During this time period, there were 158 instances of theft — triple the number for the same period last year. In fact, the entirety of 2017 saw 149 breaches, amounting to losses of only $6 million.

NEM coin accounted for the share of the hacked funds, with the majority being taken in the Coincheck breach earlier this year. Bitcoin losses of $7.66 million resulted from 94 breaches. Ripple (XRP) accounted for $13.5 million of the losses and 42 instances of theft.

Finally, 14 cases of theft involved ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum platform, totalling losses of about $542,000.

Sixty percent (102 incidences) of the 158 total reported incidences were due to individuals using the same ID and password for their cryptocurrency accounts as they did for email and online shopping — a no-no for anyone trying to safeguard online assets.

Lessons were learned in the Coincheck heist. After the rattling event, Japan’s financial watchdog, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) kicked up efforts to bring exchange operators in line with newer security measures, brought on by laws that went into effect in April 2017.

Between January 2018 and March 2018, 76 percent (120 cases) of crypto thefts were reported. After that, due in part to the NPA encouraging people to use better passwords, the number of crypto thefts dropped. And between April 2018 and June 2018, only 38 cases were reported.

Tech Bureau Corp, the company that operates Zaif cryptocurrency exchange, received two warnings from the NSA this year for its lax security measures and is likely to receive another, as regulators do their utmost to reduce cryptocurrency losses in the country.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.9062

         Brave Publishers Can Now Have Their Identities Verified with Civic
        
Civic, a digital identity firm, has collaborated with Brave, the privacy-based browser with a blockchain-based digital advertising platform, to provide identity verification services to Brave’s content creators. Verified content creators on Brave now have the option of verifying their identities using Civic’s identity verification service in order to get paid Basic Attention Tokens (BAT) via their Ethereum wallets.

Brave’s blockchain-based digital advertising platform is built on the strength of the Brave browser, which uses user attention as a metric for rewarding publishers with BAT ERC20 tokens. BATs are derived from user attention and can be used to “obtain a variety of advertising and attention-based services on the BAT platform.” Brave users can opt to anonymously reward publishers for content they find interesting by donating BATs through Brave’s integrated payment system.

Civic is an identity verification platform that allows consumers to authorize the use of their identities in real time. Leveraging Civic’s Reusable KYC, Brave’s publishers will be able to verify their identities and ensure authenticity through the Civic App, which also provides customers with control over the use of their personal information.

In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Civic CEO and Co-Founder Vinny Lingham said the partnership provides another “important use case for digital identity” as it allows Brave publishers to enjoy the convenience and simplicity of decentralized identity verification.

“With rising awareness of consumer protection and data privacy issues, it’s great to see two privacy-focused organizations coming together and leveraging blockchain technology to find better, more secure alternatives for the future,” he concluded.

Brendan Eich, the CEO and co-founder of Brave, also hailed the partnership with Civic, which he says would afford Brave’s publishers and creators the opportunity to “safely collect their tokens and get rewarded for their content.”

According to Civic, its Reusable KYC allows users to “safely and securely verify their identities” on the BAT platform in order to receive payments without sharing unnecessary data.

Having a digital identity that you can reuse eliminates the “day-to-day hassles of proving who you are,” said Lingham.

“Civic’s identity platform is all tied to the idea of a decentralized reusable identity. Just imagine a secure, trusted digital identity that would be accessible from your mobile device, never stored in a centralized database, and accepted anywhere you go, from applying for a bank account to entering a bar to boarding a flight.”

In the case of Brave, publishers who are Civic users can swiftly connect to the Civic App — which guarantees privacy and authenticity — to verify their identities on the Brave platform.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.5267
2018/10/1,Battle of the Privacycoins: What We Know About Grin and Beam’s Mimblewimble,"Based on blockchain technology, most cryptocurrencies have an open and public ledger of transactions.

Analytics companies and other interested parties — let’s call them “spies” — have ways to analyze the public blockchains and peer-to-peer networks of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, to cluster addresses and tie them to IP addresses or other identifying information.

Still, unsatisfied with Bitcoin’s privacy potential, several cryptocurrency projects have launched with the specific goal to improve on Bitcoin’s privacy features over the years. And not without success. Several of these “privacycoins” are among the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market today, with four of them taking top-50 spots in coin market capitalization rankings.

That said, Bitcoin does have some privacy features which, as this month’s cover story details, have been improving in recent months and are set to further improve in the near future. This miniseries compares different privacycoins to the privacy offered by Bitcoin and to the privacy offered by other privacycoins.

In part 5: The upcoming Mimblewimble implementations Grin and Beam

Background
In the summer of 2016, a person under the pseudonym “Tom Elvis Jedusor” (the evil wizard Voldemort’s real name in the French Harry Potter novels) published a white paper, to be mysteriously dropped in a Bitcoin research chat channel. In it, he described a proposal called “Mimblewimble” (a reference to a Harry Potter spell), which presented a radical slimming-down of the Bitcoin protocol.

Now, two years later, two projects are close to realizing versions of the Mimblewimble protocol, which will be launched as separate cryptocurrencies.

The first project is developed by a group of mostly pseudonymous volunteer contributors, several of which are using Harry Potter-related screen names — like “Ignotus Peverell,” who started the project. They call their upcoming cryptocurrency “Grin” (yet another Harry Potter reference), which is being implemented in the coding language Rust. Similar to projects like Bitcoin and Monero, Grin will not be maintained by any specific company or foundation, nor will it do an ICO or anything of the sort; instead, the project accepts donations. Once launched, miners will be able to mine one coin (“grin”) per second on average, and (unlike Bitcoin) this rate will never decrease. Grin is currently being tested and is roughly expected to launch in early 2019.

The second project was announced more recently and is called Beam. Beam is being implemented in coding language C++ (like Bitcoin Core). More comparable to Zcash, Beam will be launched and maintained by a for-profit company with the same name (currently headed by Israeli entrepreneur Alexander Zaidelson), though this maintaining role should later transition to a non-profit foundation. Beam will also have a founders’ reward: the Beam company and foundation will receive 20 percent of all newly mined coins for the first five years. It’s not yet announced what Beam’s emission schedule will look like, but (unlike Grin and like Bitcoin) it will be capped. Beam is also being tested right now and is scheduled to launch in December 2018.

Privacy
Mimblewimble combines versions of several cryptographic tricks designed for Bitcoin. In addition, it utilizes some clever math to completely strip down what typical blockchains look like.

The first trick is Confidential Transactions (CT), which will also be deployed on Blockstream’s Liquid sidechain for Bitcoin. Confidential Transactions let users blind (or hide) the amounts that are involved in a transaction so that only the sender and receiver know how much money is involved. Using a cryptographic trick called the Pedersen commitment, anyone else can still perform math on the blinded amounts. This lets them verify that the sending and receiving end of the transaction equal out, and hence that no coins were created out of thin air.

The second trick is CoinJoin, originally proposed by Bitcoin Core contributor Gregory Maxwell. CoinJoin combines several transactions into one big transaction, where all senders send money to all receivers. If done right, this obfuscates which addresses (“inputs”) are paying which addresses (“outputs”).

In the Mimblewimble protocol, however, this is taken a big step further. By combining CT and CoinJoin with more clever math, Mimblewimble gets rid of traditional private keys, public keys and addresses, only keeping inputs and outputs (these are technically not the same thing as addresses). It also gets rid of the traditional signature per transaction, which is essentially replaced with a little bit of “excess transaction data” proving ownership of the coins.

Interestingly, Mimblewimble miners take all individual transactions that would have been included in a block and instead turn the whole block into what is essentially one big “CT and CoinJoin on steroids” transaction.

The end result of this “CT and CoinJoin on steroids” is something that seems alien compared to the standard blockchains we use today. Looking at a Mimblewimble block — a combined transaction of all transactions in it — it is completely unclear which inputs paid which outputs, and it is completely unclear how many coins were involved in any of the individual transactions. If enough people use Mimblewimble (more is better), hardly any trace of funds can be established at all, presenting a tremendous boon for privacy.

Furthermore — and this is what arguably makes Mimblewimble truly special — the protocol design allows old and new transaction data to be cancelled out against each other. This allows for a radical form of pruning: most old transaction data can be forgotten. New nodes don’t need to sync to the whole blockchain, and the amount of data that nodes need to store should grow much slower than with typical blockchains.

Where privacy features in other projects are often in conflict with scalability, Mimblewimble’s powerful privacy and scaling properties go hand in hand.

Weaknesses
The innovative Mimblewimble architecture does come with some drawbacks. These include an absence of scripts (which makes blockchains programmable) and the requirement that wallets interact to create a transaction (no more sending money to address) — but both of these drawbacks can be worked around, to some extent.

More importantly, in the context of this article, Mimblewimble does not, in itself, counteract all types of blockchain analysis. If implemented naively, Mimblewimble leaves room for a type of analysis of the peer-to-peer network that closely resembles traditional blockchain analysis.

Specifically, a spy could deploy a node on the network that — like any other node — receives and forwards most (if not all) individual transactions. But — unlike any other node — this spy node would also record all these individual transactions. While all these transactions would subsequently be combined into a big “CT and CoinJoin on steroids” transaction by a miner, it’d be too late by then: The spy already knows which inputs are paying which outputs. (Though he’d still not learn how much money is moving around.)

This problem is not completely unsolvable; the Beam project has made some suggestions already. But it’s also not completely solved.

One proposed solution is to combine transactions between users even before they hit the network, similar to CoinJoin-related privacy solutions on Bitcoin. This would help the users involved, but it would also face a drawback similar to that on Bitcoin: Those users who feel they have “nothing to hide” may not want to bother with the added hassle. This, in effect, weakens privacy for all and could even raise suspicion for those that do use it.

A second proposal is to add “dummy” outputs to transactions, containing zero coins. By (automatically) spending the dummy outputs in a later block, this obfuscates where the money really moved to. This maneuver also comes at an increased cost, however, once again risking that not everyone will use it. (On the upside, it wouldn’t hurt Mimblewimble’s long-term scalability because such transaction data would cancel out and disappear.)

A third proposal is to aggregate transactions as they are spread over the network, potentially combined with a Dandelion-type of peer-to-peer obfuscation technique.* If nodes keep adding all the transactions they know about into a big CoinJoin-like transaction before forwarding it, a “snowball effect” would make it exceedingly hard for spies to learn anything useful. This solution is quite challenging to implement, however, and introduces several new problems. (But it can be combined with the dummy output solution, further benefiting the potential of both.) 

All this brings us to Mimblewimble’s biggest and most obvious “weakness”: Grin and Beam are still works in progress. The potential of the Mimblewimble protocol is very promising, but much depends on the specific implementations, making it impossible to say exactly how strong the privacy guarantees of these projects will be and how this will compare to Bitcoin and other privacycoins.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.128
2018/10/3,Brave CEO Pens Letter to Senate Committee Asking for GDPR-Like Privacy Regulation,"Brendan Eich, the CEO of Brave, has written a letter to the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation urging them to implement GDPR-like legislation in the United States.

GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation and works to secure the data and privacy of all individuals within the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA). In addition, it addresses the exporting of personal data outside these two organizations. GDPR seeks to give individuals control over their personal information and simplify the regulatory atmosphere for international business ventures.

Based in San Francisco, Brave is a new kind of browser that allegedly offers users faster speeds and stronger security by blocking trackers and advertisements. In his letter, Eich describes GDPR as a “great leveler” and says it has allowed many new businesses in Europe to flourish by preventing larger, more established corporations from disadvantaging them.

“The GDPR’s principle of ‘purpose limitation’ will begin to prevent dominant platforms from using data that they have collected for one purpose at one end of their business to the benefit of other parts of their business in a way that currently disadvantages new entrants,” Eich writes.

“In general, platform giants will need ‘opt-in’ consent for each purpose for which they want to use consumers’ data. This will create a breathing space for new entrants to emerge.”

Eich says GDPR-like standards have been adopted in several countries around the world including China, Brazil, Japan, India, South Korea and Argentina. Together, these countries make up roughly 51 percent of the world’s overall GDP and have experienced higher levels of efficiency and innovation in their business markets.

Eich believes that should the U.S. move in a similar direction, the country can keep its competitive edge and affirm its reputation as a leading global tech hub.

Furthermore, he suggests that GDPR-like protocols will establish greater trust within the United States between businesses and customers, as it is not necessary to track people’s movements online: the main reason for doing so is simply to generate ad-based revenue from the sites customers visit. Since late 2017, approximately 615 million devices built to block ads and tracking have been activated, suggesting a growing level of unease and distrust amongst everyday consumers.

“A GDPR-like standard in the United States will establish the foundation of trust to enable innovation and growth,” he writes. “This certainly applies in our own online media and advertising industry. Contrary to some of our industry colleagues, I believe that it is not tenable for any platform, publisher, technology vendor or trade body to claim that they must track people to generate revenue from advertising … Trust will only return as the GDPR-like laws begin to curtail the online advertising industry’s worst practices.”

Tracking movements to garner ad revenue occurs through a process known as online behavioral advertising (OBA). Data is collected from all the sites a consumer visits. Ads are then selected for display to the consumer based on his or her past maneuvers. Eich says OBA occurs via several third-party networks operating quietly through “opaque processes” with no central authority to be held accountable. In other words, this is a form of “behavioral tracking,” and he questions how ethical and safe it really is.

Recently, Eich filed privacy complaints in both Britain and Ireland against internet giant Google for playing “fast and loose” with customers’ private data. In his initial complaint, Eich said that Google offers intimate data about its consumers to several hundred companies without their knowledge to auction and place ads. He claims this goes against GDPR requirements that personal data be processed in a way that all consumers remain secure.

In addition, Facebook was at the height of scandal earlier this year when it was revealed that data firm Cambridge Analytica had gathered private information on millions of social media users without their knowledge and used it for political purposes. Cases like these are suggestive that tech companies have garnered too much power, and user data is usually under threat of being compromised.

Interestingly, GDPR also offers a “right to erasure” clause, in which a subject’s collected data is immediately erased from a company’s records granted the information was gathered unlawfully, is no longer needed, or the subject in question withdraws consent for the data to be used. This could present issues for blockchain-based companies, as all information on the blockchain is recorded in real-time to ensure irrefutable evidence of transactions and other relevant data.

At the same time, one of the primary requests among investors who engage in crypto-transactions via the blockchain is improved privacy and anonymity. Heightened usage of privacycoins like Monero and Zcash are proof of this, which means statutes similar to those of GDPR could be in line with the ideologies of privacy-focused blockchains.

GDPR is based on standards the United States initially endorsed back in 1980 through legislation known as the OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data. This legislation included a definition of the term “personal data” similar with that offered by GDPR. Also, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been fighting for GDPR-like features for over 10 years.

Brave as a company stands to gain little, if anything, directly from GDPR-like legislation being implemented in the United States. While the Brave browser protects user privacy and restricts advertisements, GDPR-like legislature would simply push forward what Eich and his company already believe: users deserve privacy over their online data. Eich’s letter reiterates that societies around the world are shifting toward a paradigm with a level playing field on the internet and that the United States should follow suit.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.5267
2018/10/12,Crypto Cybercrime Has Tripled Since 2017; Nearly $1 Billion Lost in 2018,"Most digital exchanges are unregulated and therefore unqualified to safely process cryptocurrency transactions. They don’t employ necessary know-your-customer (KYC) tactics, and roughly $1 billion in digital asset funds have been stolen since the start of 2018.

These are the unsettling claims made by a new report released by blockchain and virtual currency forensics firm CipherTrace.

The most popular target currency still appears to be bitcoin, and one of the document’s key findings is that roughly 97 percent of bitcoin used in illegal transactions or that stem from criminal activity are sent to unregulated digital exchanges that enforce weak anti-money laundering (AML) tactics. An exchange is considered lacking in AML mechanisms if it does not regulate illegal drug dealing, maintain records over time, report suspicious or large transactions, or enforce KYC regulations, the report details.

In addition, nearly 5 percent of all bitcoins received by unregulated exchanges come from criminal transactions, and some of the world’s top exchanges have laundered as much as $2.5 billion in BTC.

To uncover these findings, researchers at CipherTrace examined over 45 million cryptocurrency transactions through roughly 20 of the world’s largest and most dominant exchanges. A transaction was marked as “criminal” if it came from a dark market website or through means of extortion, ransomware, malware or terrorist financing.

To fully comprehend the damage, the authors also examined crypto funds reported stolen in 2017 to see if the last nine months have been more devastating. According to the report, over $900 million of the more than $1 billion reported stolen in 2018 was taken in just the first three quarters of this year, meaning that the amount of theft has more than tripled since last year.

However, most of these losses can ultimately be blamed on the massive Coincheck hack that took place in January. That one theft was large enough to account for more than half of the reported losses in CipherTrace’s study. Other major hacks that occurred throughout 2018 include those on South Korean exchanges Bithumb ($30 million) and Coinrail ($40 million), as well as Japan-based Zaif ($60 million).

While the document discusses several methods of crypto theft, the most common one appears to be phishing, in which mass, customized extortion occurs through email and other electronic means to garner cryptocurrency-based ransoms. Other common methods include advanced malware and targeting employees of cryptocurrency exchanges directly.

The report also mentions SIM swapping. Though the report indicates that this is still a relatively new method of theft, SIM swapping is an insidious process by which a victim’s phone number is transferred to a thief’s SIM card. The thief then uses the number to change passwords and access the victim’s accounts.

Researchers also mention many of the regulatory actions taken against crypto-hackers, many of which have occurred in the third quarter. Among the most prominent are AMLD 5, which was passed by the European Commission on July 9, 2018. The new ruling states that by January 20, 2020, all AML and counter terrorism funding (CTF) laws presently applied to banks and traditional financial institutions will also apply to digital currency platforms. AMLD 5 also enforces identity checks for every new customer.

In addition, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is looking to apply all its present standards designed for traditional monetary establishments to virtual currencies by the end of June 2019. It is also seeking to ensure these standards are implemented in every nation. Currently, there are several countries that the FATF classifies as “rogue states,” or regions that deny compatibility with FATF goals and refuse to cooperate. These include Syria, Pakistan, Iran, Tunisia and Yemen among others.

However, the authors do take note of several countries working to instill appropriate regulation of virtual currencies and blockchain businesses. Two that really stand out are Malta and Canada, the former having established several licensing requirements for initial coin offerings (ICOs) and similar funding ventures scheduled to go into full effect on November 1.

Canada is also seeking to bring crypto regulation to new heights by requiring payment processors and digital currency exchanges be treated as money service businesses (MSBs). This will require stronger KYC rules for all crypto-related business. Should this law pass, it will go into effect in late 2019.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.9849
2018/10/19,North Korean Hacking Group Lazarus Behind $571M in Hacks Since January 2017,"North Korean cybercrime hacking group The Lazarus Group is currently the biggest crypto hacking syndicate in the world, having stolen millions worth of cryptocurrencies from online exchanges. Also known as HIDDEN COBRA, which works at the behest of the North Korean government, the Lazarus Group has been responsible for some of the world's largest cyber attacks including the Sony hack in 2014, the Wannacry ransomware outbreak, military espionage and a number of attacks on South Korean businesses.

In a report acquired by news outlet HardFork, cybersecurity outfit Group-IB outlines trends in hi-tech cybercrime, detailing 14 different attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges since January 2017. It suggests that Lazarus has been responsible for the disappearance of over $571 million in cryptocurrency.

What is most interesting about the data from Group-IB is that a large majority of the targeted exchanges are domiciled in South Korea, such as Bithumb, YouBit and Coinrail.

This data appears to confirm accusations made by a member of South Korea’s parliamentary intelligence committee that the North Korean government has stolen cryptocurrency worth billions of won last year from South Korean exchanges.

Hackers who target cryptocurrency exchanges favor traditional methods and tools such as spear phishing, social engineering and malware. According to the cybersecurity group, hackers were able to steal 10 percent of the total funds raised by initial coin offering (ICO) platforms over the past year and a half, with 50 percent of the funds lost to phishers.

Cybercriminals can create fake web pages, simulating the real project, tricking investors who are desperate to jump in on the next big thing. The report notes that large phishing groups have become so skilled in their craft, they can steal as much as $1 million in a day.

One incident that stands out was the creation of phishing sites for Telegram's ICO project, which allowed the thieves to scam would-be investors of Telegram's ICO. Gramtoken.io was the most prominent fake website during that period. It built authenticity by stealing details from Telegram's white papers, project roadmap and more.

Phishing schemes can also take the form of investor database theft which hackers can resell on the darknet or use to blackmail crypto holders.

While attacks on ICOs might have dwindled in the wake of the clampdown by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Group-IB believes the previous attacks on ICOs remain a threat for any crypto project that attracts investors. The group also predicts that phishing scams won't go away anytime soon, but they will become harder to detect as fraudsters unveil new tricks and tools to perpetrate their crimes.

“Fraudulent phishing-schemes involving crypto-brands will only get more complex as well as cybercriminals’ level of preparation for phishing attacks,” the report warns. “Automated phishing and the use of so-called ‘phishing-kits’ will become more widespread, including for the attacks on ICOs.”

The cybersecurity group sees a future where state-sponsored hackers, like the Lazarus Group, could target large mining pools, as 51-percent attacks seem to be on the increase.

“In 2017, no successful 51-percent attacks were detected, but they are now [happening] more often. In the first half of 2018, five successful attacks were registered with direct financial losses ranging from $0.55 million to $18 million,” the report concluded.

2018/10/22,Monero Transaction Fees Reduced by 97% After Bulletproofs Upgrade,"After the recent hard fork upgrade of its protocol, Monero has seen its transaction fees shrink by approximately 97 percent, dropping from 60 cents to just 2 cents. Crypto analytics firm Coinmetrics shared a tweet confirming the drop in fees and their corresponding reduction in transaction size, falling from 18.5kb pre-fork to 3kb — an 80 percent change.

The upgrade, called “Monero 0.13.0 Beryllium Bullet,” implements ""bulletproofs.” First introduced by researchers at Stanford, the cryptographic scheme shrinks the size and cost of transactions specifically for Confidential Transactions.  

Why Bulletproofs?
As stated above, Bulletproofs are a scaling complement to Monero’s Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT), Monero's main privacy feature, which uses a combination of ring signatures and Confidential Transactions. Ring signatures are cryptographic digital signatures that protect a user's privacy in the input side of a transaction by making it nearly impossible to determine who the actual signer of a transaction is.

To achieve this privacy, each Monero transaction includes additional, extraneous coins (decoys) to mask the exact coin being signed, making it extremely difficult to parse the real coins being sent from the decoys. Before the upgrade, six decoys were added to each Monero transaction--now, ten will be featured in each.

Bolstering the privacy provided by ring signatures, Confidential Transactions let users hide the amount exchanged in a transaction by leveraging a cryptographic trick dubbed the Pedersen commitment.

While the RingCT format makes transactions more private, it also makes the system less scalable than other cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin. Bulletproof shrinks the size of the cryptographic proof, which cuts the transaction size drastically. While Monero can't get rid of old transaction data, which is currently above 20 gigabytes and growing — out of a total 60 gigabytes — the recent upgrade ensures the network now requires less storage space for transactions than it used to.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.1761
2018/10/24,Blockchain Verification and Decentralized Subversion in Cambodia,"Season 2 of Distributed Dialogues has begun, and a general theme will be the connection of major, real-world problems to possible solutions using blockchain technology. This is displayed in full on the first episode, which combines a historical context on Cambodian state repression with ways in which promising new technologies may bring new freedom of the press.

Like many aspects of the transition from French Indochina to independent states, alongside all the wars and U.S. interventions, it becomes difficult to fully understand the historical context. To help the audience understand how Cambodia got where it is today, Distributed Dialogues interviewed veteran journalist David Andelman. Andelman covered the Cambodian Civil War in the ’70s, and came close enough to the front lines to find himself encircled by the Khmer Rouge. Using his wide breadth of knowledge and personal investment in this conflict, Andelman gives listeners a vivid and straightforward background on the state of affairs.

As for the current political repression in Cambodia, exiled Member of Parliament Mu Sochua came onto the show to discuss the ban of the nation’s opposition party, her exile from Cambodia and the state of affairs today. Sochua escaped a purge of this opposition party that found many leaders imprisoned. She is now a permanent resident of France and advocate for Cambodian freedom. Despite witnessing some of the horrors of life under the Khmer Rouge and its successors, Sochua remains resolute, stating, “As we try to rebuild a nation that’s been totally destroyed by violence, death, and mass murder, we have to also look to what is rich in our society, our culture.”

Tying the episode together, Mounir Ibrahim discusses the ways that blockchain technology can intervene in the oppressive state’s stranglehold over the flow of information. Inspired by his work in the sState dDepartment in Syria and by the Arab Spring, Ibrahim was drawn to the power of a trustless, decentralized system for its ability to let citizens verify news themselves. His company, Truepic, verifies the authenticity of pictures taken on an in-app camera, encrypts all associated metadata, makes sure that the phone’s operating system has not been tampered with and stores pictures on a blockchain. By doing this, he believes that any concerned citizen with a smartphone can document public atrocities committed by authoritarian regimes and provide an alternative to state-run media.

These three guests provide a nuanced picture of autocracy, from its fledgling steps to its actions after decades in power. Using blockchain verification can be a possible way for people to push back against these actions in the present day; this will be a recurring theme throughout the episodes of Distributed Dialogues Season 2. Look for future exploration in the world of blockchain and authoritarianism on the Let’s Talk Bitcoin Network.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.9358
2018/10/25,Blockchain Releases Hardware Wallet Co-Developed With Ledger,"Google Ventures-backed Blockchain is debuting a hardware wallet that integrates with its software services, a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine details.

In a partnership with hardware wallet manufacturer Ledger, the cryptocurrency software company has developed what it calls “a custom hardware device.” Dubbed the Blockchain Lockbox, the wallet, like Ledger’s own suite of products, will allow users to store their private keys offline in the device. This practice, referred to as cold storage, is considered a safer alternative to hot storage, wherein private keys are held in software connected to the internet.

According to the release, existing Ledger users “will be able to pair their Nano S devices” to the Lockbox, and a representative told Bitcoin Magazine that ""it will also facilitate crypto-to-crypto trades through Blockchain’s native brokerage, Swap."" When asked which coins the wallet would support, the representative said that ""Lockbox will mainly support Bitcoin, Ether and Bitcoin Cash. Though, the teams are in the works to add support for additional asset depending on user demand.""

“We’re thrilled to offer the Lockbox to Blockchain users so they can easily manage their funds online and offline seamlessly,” Peter Smith, CEO and co-founder of Blockchain, said in the release.

The wallet will interface directly with Blockchain’s software wallet, and it will be exclusively compatible “only with Blockchain’s software,” a Blockchain representative told Bitcoin Magazine. This will allow users to manage their hardware wallet’s holdings using the software, while also offering what Smith calls “more functionality than previously existed” by giving users the flexibility to transfer funds back and forth from the Lockbox to Blockchain’s software wallet.

Ledger’s president, Pascal Gauthier, called the partnership “a natural fit,” stressing the importance both companies — and the crypto community at large — place on cyber security.

“With stories about crypto hacking continuing to dominate headlines, it’s obvious that security must be top of mind for all stakeholders in the crypto space. With the combined forces of Blockchain and Ledger, users are truly getting the best of both worlds,” he said.

Though seemingly hyperbolic, Gauthier isn’t exaggerating when he says hacks “dominate headlines.” The first month of 2018 saw the biggest hack in the industry’s history since Mt. Gox, and Japan alone has suffered over half a billion dollars worth of losses this year.

The hardware wallet is open for preorders today, October 25, 2018, with delivery slated for mid-November, and the press release indicates that early customers will receive a “special edition blue version” of the wallet.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.9866
2018/10/30,Telefónica and Rivetz Add Civic’s Identity Verification for Mobile Users,"Civic has entered into a tripartite agreement with cybersecurity protection solution company, Rivetz, and Telefónica's cybersecurity unit, ElevenPaths, to provide secure identity verification that incorporates added hardware protections for mobile users.

With presence in five countries, Civic uses blockchain technology to secure and protect the transfer of personal information, while allowing people to decide how they share their information.

In correspondence with Bitcoin Magazine, Steven Sprague, CEO of Rivetz, called Civic's integration into the partnership as a ""pivotal step toward providing the digital identity we need in today’s world.""

In May 2018, Spanish telecom giant Telefónica partnered with Rivetz to develop decentralized security solutions for mobile users aimed at improving cybersecurity controls and protections for secure messaging and cryptocurrency wallets.

Rivetz's security solutions will leverage the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), a hardware vault built into mobile phones for enhanced security. These solutions will be built into smartphones and supplemented with a secured Subscriber Identity Module (SIM), provided by Telefónica. The intention is to secure the private keys of users, even if the operating system is tampered with or infected by malware.

Civic's inclusion will make it possible for Telefónica's users to verify their identity in real time and separate locally stored personal information from the private key needed to sign transactions on the blockchain. Rather than having all details stored locally in one place, on the Civic App, Civic will store the private keys in the TEE, provided by Rivetz. The user's personal information will remain in the Civic App, which is protected by biometrics and high-level encryption.

CEO and Co-Founder of Civic Vinny Lingham sees the partnership as “a massive step.”

“Blockchain technology is transforming the way companies approach privacy and security,” he said to Bitcoin Magazine. “Our partnership with Rivetz and Telefónica is a reflection of that transformation, ensuring that digital identity and mobile security solutions go hand-in-hand.”

Lingham added, “As identity information is increasingly vulnerable, we’re working with like-minded companies to create the most effective, most secure identity solutions that protect people’s privacy, without requiring their data to be collected and stored.”",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.9932
2018/10/31,"EY Prototype Allows Private Transactions on Ethereum’s Blockchain
","In a bid to lower the barriers to mainstream adoption of blockchain technology, professional services giant Ernst & Young (EY) has launched a solution that it claims will allow companies to transact privately on Ethereum’s blockchain using zero-knowledge proof (ZKP).

Dubbed the EY Ops Chain Public Edition (PE), the solution will reportedly allow enterprises to issue and sell product tokens on a “public blockchain with private access to their transaction records.” This announcement comes on the heels of EY’s launch of the EY Ops Chain, a set of apps and services created to help businesses commercialize the use of blockchain technology.

With millions of users and a market cap of approximately $20 billion, Ethereum's blockchain is larger than most private blockchains, but its ecosystem’s size, which comes with a plethora of smart contract applications and tokens, also requires a considerable amount of computational power to operate it, as well as less transaction privacy than private blockchains. According to the report, EY Ops Chain PE will offer the best of both worlds.

In an email correspondence with Bitcoin Magazine, Paul Brody, EY global innovation leader of blockchain technology, stated:

“EY Ops Chain PE is a first-of-its-kind application and a major step forward that empowers blockchain adoption. Private blockchains give enterprises transaction privacy, but at the expense of reduced security and resiliency.”

The new EY Ops Chain PE uses ZKP technology to enable the transfer of private tokens without tampering with Ethereum’s consensus algorithm. Developed by the EY blockchain labs in Europe, with patents pending in the United Kingdom and France, the prototype system will also support “payment tokens and unique product and services tokens that are similar to the Ethereum ERC-20 and ERC-721 token standards.”

In practice, a zero-knowledge proof allows users to prove that they know a piece of information, be that a transaction amount or some other value, without actually revealing the underlying information. For corporations and businesses that don’t want to make sensitive financial or business information public, this privacy is considered a must if they are to use blockchain technology for their day-to-day.

“With zero-knowledge proofs, organizations can transact on the same network as their competition in complete privacy and without giving up the security of the public Ethereum blockchain,” Brody concluded.

The new solution will include the EY Blockchain Private Transaction Monitor, which monitors and keeps a record of transactions. The company is working on a public release of the EY Ops Chain PE and the EY Blockchain Private Transaction Monitor for 2019.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.9899
2018/10/31,Wasabi Wallet 1.0 Is Here to Make Bitcoin Transactions More Private,"Wasabi Wallet 1.0 went live today, October 31, 2018. The release, which Wasabi’s creator Ádám Ficsór humbly called “nothing revolutionary,” cleans up the software and makes it compatible with macOS.

“The 1.0 release is a download and run that works properly on all platforms (Windows, Linux, OSX.) We made the wallet load time faster, caught some memory leaks, [and] rewrote the OSX backend of the UI library we used,” Ficsór told Bitcoin Magazine.

A self-described “open-source, non-custodial, privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet,” Wasabi’s anonymity features center around ZeroLink, a protocol introduced by its creator, Ádám Ficsór. The protocol is a privacy framework that Ficsór architected by resurrecting a transaction cloaking method that was first proposed in 2013 but which was soon forgotten.

Known as Chaumian CoinJoin, the transaction trick works just as its name would imply. Essentially, it bundles transactions together to obfuscate who is sending what to whom. To work, however, each party needs to be sending the same amount, otherwise it would be easy to discern from the difference in bitcoin sent who is sending and receiving which coins.

Ficsór focused on CoinJoin and his brainchild ZeroLink came after he implemented TumbleBit into Stratis’ Breeze Wallet. The feature offers similar privacy benefits as CoinJoin, though it is more centralized and participants receive a different coin from the one they send.

In our correspondence, Ficsór said Wasabi’s own CoinJoin feature “has seen over 150 BTC [transacted] with equal output amounts,” something that, combined with the team not finding “any remotely serious issues,” made Ficsór and company “pretty confident in promoting the software to be 1.0.”

He also indicated that, while the updated version doesn’t tinker with the CoinJoin protocol in any way, it does include a few fundamental changes to his own invention in ZeroLink.

“I designed ZeroLink in mind so that many wallets would be able to conform to ‘wallet fungibility requirements,’ however this wasn’t feasible in practice … The idea was to not let people ever join two coins together if they were already mixed … To mitigate the risks, we had to come up with a clever labeling system that led us down a road to build a coin control feature with an intra-wallet blockchain analysis tool into Wasabi. This allows the user to make educated decisions on which coins they can join together if they need to.

“Later, when we saw how people use the wallet, it even got better. When designing ZeroLink I did not anticipate users to keep remixing their coins, but they do and to such an extent that it leads to an exponential anonymity increase because the re-mixes are perfect mixes, and today, 40-60 percent of all mixes are remixes. So that was quite a surprising turn of events,” he said.

Ficsór stressed in our conversation that the latest release places heavy emphasis on user experience. Going forward, the team will try to iron out technical kinks even more to create a smoother, more user friendly experience — if funds and manpower allow, that is.

“We are currently occupied by working on stability, performance, UX and code quality. This is our highest priority. New issues will constantly come up as new users try to use the software. At this point, it is unclear if Wasabi will ever have the resources to tackle such things.”",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.9932
2018/11/9,Fraudulent South Korean Exchange Pure Bit Nabs $2.8M in ICO Exit Scam,"A South Korean ICO has defrauded its private sale investors out of roughly 13,500 ETH ($2.8 million) before disappearing from the internet entirely.

Pure Bit, which has already pulled the plug on its website, has apparently conducted a fairly routine exit scam for its Pure Coin token sale. The cryptocurrency was pitched as an exchange token for Pure Bit, an exchange that was supposed to launch by the end of the month. The Coin  promised to give investors shares of the exchange’s trading revenue as well as discounted fees for trading, and its anonymous team claimed that it would burn 90% of token supply over a three year period.

A block explorer for the ICO’s Ethereum wallet displays several in-bound transactions from investors beginning on November 4, 2018. On November 9, 2018, however, an initial 500 ether was transferred out, with the remaining 13,178 withdrawn 20 minutes later.

Not all of the evidence of this company’s very existence was destroyed immediately, however. A thread on Reddit captured some of the last moments of the exchange and took several screenshots with translations from the original Korean.

According to Reddit user u/Tbid, who evidently watched the saga unfold, Pure Bit was a crypto exchange that announced an ICO launch of an exchange token. Almost immediately after the ICO ended, however, all of the funds were spirited away to another single wallet address.

As depicted in the attached screenshots, the community admin quickly kicked out every participant in their Kakao chat thread, before sending a final message of “Thank You.” This information was corroborated by a Twitter thread, which added that the admin’s message on their now-defunct Kakao profile was a terse but excessively formal apology.Between the wallet transfers, suspicious website activity and the admin’s explicit apology, this exit scam is about as by-the-book as they come. Duplicitous activities such as this are a recurring threat in the world of ICO launches, which forms a large part of the reasoning why South Korea banned ICOs altogether.

Having committed a crime even before stealing such vast sums of money, the anonymous administrators of Pure Bit are likely in for some extensive legal troubles. As one commenter in the Reddit thread remarked, the South Korean government is likely to be “hot on their tails.”

Even without the threat of exit scams, South Korean law enforcement is well-used to dealing with routine cybersecurity threats, as the world’s largest crypto hacking syndicate, which is literally sponsored by the North Korean government, has targeted South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges on a number of occasions.

2018/11/12,New Exchange Security Scoring Model Offers Insurance Rates for Coin Holders,"International cybersecurity solutions provider Group-IB has come up with a scoring model to grade crypto exchanges based on their level of security.

The scoring model was created by Group-IB in conjunction with Swiss-based Cryptolns (which is operated by Swiss insurance broker APIS AS), and the grading is intrinsic to CryptoIns’ new cryptocurrency exchange insurance, which will allow exchange users to cover up to 15 BTC worth of digital assets held in their exchange accounts. With the scoring model’s data, CryptoIns has calculated rates for their coverage depending on an exchange’s level of security and asset-protection measures.

This insurance will be available for assets held on leading exchanges like Binance, OKEx, Kraken and Huobi, while a full list can be found on CryptoIns’ website.

“Currently, approximately 3,600,000 BTC are stored in user accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges, making this market highly attractive for hackers,” Timofey Volkov, CEO of CryptoIns, explained.

Per a recent Forbes article, crypto exchanges are attractive to hackers due to their design: They have a centralized single point of failure, making them prone to the same problems faced by millions of web applications globally. This is where the assessment from Group-IB gets interesting for the investor.

The grading from Group-IB took the exchanges’ architecture and infrastructure into consideration to better understand the mechanisms used in countering potential threats.

While developing the framework for its insurance policy, Cryptolns revealed that it assessed a number of exchanges using various parameters, including “the level of technical security [and] the reliability of key storage, password, and personal data of customers provided by each exchange.”

Explaining the challenges faced by insurers in the crypto industry, Volkov stated that:

“Collaboration with one of the leading international cybersecurity companies will help us organize and conduct pre-insurance evaluations of the exchanges in order to assess their security, as well as the potential for fraudulent activities on the part of the founders and management.”

Risk Groups
The scoring by CryptoIns also sorted exchanges into four risk groups based on aggregated information which includes ""assessment of traded volume, traders’ activity, internal fees and other characteristics."" Exchanges categorized in the first group were graded as being the least vulnerable, second and third were ""rated satisfactory and low in security risk,"" while those in the fourth group were deemed to be overly risky, with the company saying it won't provide insurance for such exchanges.

Base insurance rates are put at 2.5 percent per quarter. Each of the groups was entitled to different discounts with the maximum being a 50 percent discount, the report states.

According to CryptoIns' insurance calculator on its website, U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken ranks as the safest digital asset platform with a lower cost of insuring assets. It costs users 0.0125 BTC for every 1 BTC stored on Kraken at a 1.25 percent insurance rate. The same 1 BTC will be insured on Binance and Bibox for 0.019 BTC and 0.025 BTC, respectively.

Falling under the overly risky group were exchanges like Yobit which emerged as the least secure. Other less-secure exchanges, according to the list, were Zaif, Bitstamp, Bit-Z and TopBTC.

Cyber threats on crypto exchanges have become a recurring event. In September 2018, Japanese digital assets platform Zaif reportedly lost $59 million due to a security breach on its system. Bithumb, CoinGrail and BitGrail all lost $30 million, $40 million and $195 million, respectively, earlier in the year.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.34
2018/11/14,"Target and Google Official Twitter Accounts Hacked, Used for Crypto Scams","In what is becoming an emerging trend, Twitter accounts of popular brands are being hacked in an attempt to scam unsuspecting users out of their cryptocurrencies.

Target and Google are two high profile targets that have seen their accounts taken over by hackers who, in turn, have used them to scam followers by advertising fraudulent crypto giveaways.

Google's G Suite Twitter Account is Hacked!! Target's Twitter account, which is followed by nearly 2 million users, posted a tweet, confirming the hack which occurred on November 13, 2018. The retailer stated:

""Early this morning, our Twitter account was inappropriately accessed. The access lasted for approx. half an hour & one fake tweet was posted during that time about a bitcoin scam. We have regained control of the account, are in close contact with Twitter & are investigating now.""

Seemingly targeted by the hacking syndicate, Google's G Suite Twitter account was breached hours after Target fell victim. The hack on Google was marked by the same tactics as the one that plagued Target — a scammy tweet ridden with typos promising free bitcoin to G Suite's 800,000 followers.

A Google spokesperson confirmed the hack to Business Insider in a statement:

""This morning an unauthorized promoted tweet was shared from the G Suite account. We removed the tweet and are investigating with Twitter now.""

These incidents are a more sophisticated version of the Twitter scams that have become a constant nuisance for the cryptocurrency community. Typically, these scams include bad actors merely imitating popular figures in the crypto industry with near-identical profiles, though it’s rare for the real accounts themselves to be taken over to advertise the scams.

While it's unclear how scammers are gaining access to the brands' social media account, it's obvious new measures are needed to combat the scams.

Criticized in the past for its failure to devise a clear defense against these incidents, Twitter is reportedly working on counter security measures to prevent similar breaches like the one witnessed by Target on its platform in the future.

2018/11/21,A Bug Making Ethereum Transactions on Exchanges Vulnerable Has Been Fixed,"A bug centering around a new Ethereum token, GasToken, which was enabling abuse on cryptocurrency exchanges, appears to have been resolved. The details are provided in a report originally published on November 13, 2018, that discussed how the bug was exploited by attackers, and what digital platforms could do if they wished to protect their hot wallet funds.

It was unclear which exchanges could or could not be affected by the bug. Thus, private disclosures were issued to “as many exchanges as possible” according to a Medium post. While it was determined that most of these exchanges were not in any danger, all vulnerable exchanges have since instilled the proper protections. At press time, the bug is no longer considered a threat.

According to its website, GasToken is an Ethereum-based contract that allows individuals to tokenize the Ethereum network through a special refund mechanism. Users can store gas when the price is low and garner refunds when it’s high.

The website reads, “Every transaction on the network must include some gas, and the fee paid to miners for each transaction is directly proportional to the gas consumed by a transaction. GasToken allows a transaction to do the same amount of work and pay for less gas, saving on miner fees and costs and allowing users to bid higher gas prices without paying correspondingly higher fees.”

The document alleges that many exchanges either enforced no gas usage limits or allowed for the withdrawal of ether to arbitrary addresses. Combined with GasToken’s refund structure, an open doorway was subsequently provided to attackers, who could then mint gas whenever they received ether and make exchanges pay for arbitrary computation.

Attackers could exploit the bug in one of two ways. The first was by performing computations through Ethereum’s fallback function when a contract received Ethereum-based tokens from an exchange. If a malicious actor wanted to attack an exchange, the attacker could do so by initiating withdrawals to a contract address they controlled.

Granted the person operating the exchange had failed to enforce gas limits or know-your-customer (KYC) protocols, the exchange would pay the transaction fees out of their own hot wallet. The attacker could then create several accounts to bypass any single account withdrawal limits. They could also mint GasTokens, thereby causing the exchange owner’s wallet to drain even further.

The second attack vector could be exploited through a token’s transfer function. The attacker could force an exchange to pay for large amounts of computation and even cause it to burn its own ether supply.

From there, the attacker could drain the exchange’s hot wallet or mint the GasTokens for a profit if they controlled the token’s code on an exchange if the token featured an upgradeable contract or if the exchange automatically lists tokens. Whenever a token transfer occurred, the attacker could work to update the function, which would perform the same computation described in the first method, and the exchange would then pay the costs of every future transfer of that token.

The good news was that the bug could only affect exchanges that initiated Ethereum transactions not those that processed them. Thus, decentralized exchanges or those based on similar smart contract technology that processed transactions initiated by users were likely to remain unaffected.

The report listed several options to ensure the problem didn’t persist. For example, the authors suggested implementing reasonable gas limits on all transactions. That way, if any particularly expensive transactions occurred, the users would bear all the costs, ensuring exchanges remained free and clear of any charges.

In addition, exchange operators were advised to enforce both gas monitoring and rate limiting on all withdrawals. Most exchanges usually incorporate either one or the other, and neither tactic can do much on its own. Lastly, Ethereum-based contracts were told to implement gas usage restrictions when making calls to unknown addresses.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.9893
2018/12/31,Security Researchers Reveal Wallet Vulnerabilities On Stage at 35C3,"In a demonstration titled “Wallet.fail,” a team of security researchers hacked into the Trezor One, Ledger Blue and Ledger Nano S. Unfortunately, it appears as if their findings were first put on display at the 35th Chaos Communication Congress (35C3) in Leipzig, Germany, rather than through accepted Responsible Disclosure practices, which would have allowed the manufacturers to patch the vulnerabilities and protect their customers from any potential attack. Fortunately, the vulnerabilities appear to be very difficult for attackers to actually exploit.

The team of experts included security researchers Dmitry Nedospasov, Josh Datko and systems engineer Thomas Roth. Among the vulnerabilities revealed in the presentation were several that could have been fixed with a firmware upgrade on the hardware wallets in question.

SatoshiLabs, the manufacturers of Trezor wallets, through its Chief Technology Officer Pavol Rusnak, insisted that the company had not been notified about the vulnerabilities demonstrated at the event, going on to add that there's a ""Responsible Disclosure program"" that the researchers could have followed to give them a heads-up about the loopholes.

""With regards to #35c3 findings about @Trezor: we were not informed via our Responsible Disclosure program beforehand, so we learned about them from the stage. We need to take some time to fix these, and we'll be addressing them via a firmware update at the end of January.""

Ledger took the same exception, claiming in a blog post to have been sidelined by the researchers, who could have notified them through a disclosure, which they claim would have given the firm the time needed ""for the vulnerability to be patched as well as to mitigate risks for users.""

The Vulnerabilities
As for the vulnerabilities themselves, it appears that they cannot (yet) be exploited remotely; most of them require that the intruder have physical access to the devices in question — and sometimes access to the owner’s computer as well.

At the presentation, the security experts claimed to have flashed a Trezor One hardware wallet, which allowed them to extract the mnemonic seed (and PIN) from the RAM, going on to add that the vulnerability can only be exploited against users who don't set a passphrase.

The team also claimed to have installed their firmware on the Ledger Nano S, allowing them to manipulate the wallet by signing transactions remotely. To do this, the intruder would have to physically access the Nano S and hack into the victim's PC, where malware is installed to steal the PIN once the victim loads Ledger's Bitcoin app.

Ledger claims that since this scenario requires an intruder to have physical access to the device, access to the victim's computer and the patience to wait for the victim to put in his PIN and launch the Bitcoin app on the PC, this type of attack is unlikely to pose much of a practical threat.

The security researchers also demonstrated a proof-of-concept, side-channel attack on Ledger's most expensive hardware wallet, the Ledger Blue. According to the team, Ledger Blue leaks signals sent to its touchscreen as radio waves, making them vulnerable. This is due to the animation of the PIN keyboard. The researchers claim the signal could get stronger when a USB cable is attached to the device, allowing them to sniff the PIN of the Ledger Blue remotely.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.9524
2019/1/8,Bitcoin Wallet Forced to Drop Key Privacy Features From Google Play App,"Privacy-focused bitcoin wallet Samourai is having its hand forced by Google.

According to a Samourai blog post, the wallet provider is disabling privacy features that are key to its design before its latest version, 0.99.4, hits the Google Play store tomorrow. The removed features include Samourai’s Stealth Mode, remote text message (SMS) commands, and SIM Switch Defense (a measure to protect against sim swaps).

The privacy restrictions only affect the version of the wallet available on Google Play. To bypass these restrictions, users can also download what Samourai calls the “non-nerfed version” of the wallet client’s latest version directly from the project’s Github. Down the road, the team also hopes to get the wallet, privacy features fully-enabled, listed on F-Droid and other alternative, open-source app stores, as well.

“In October, Google announced changes to their policies regarding SMS and Dialer permissions that apps are allowed to use. The way that our Stealth Mode, Remote SMS commands, and SIM Switch Defense work require use of these permissions,” a Samourai Wallet representative told Bitcoin Magazine in an email correspondence.

Samourai proceeded to file for an exemption, but they were notified of their exemption’s rejection just “a few days ago,” according to the representative.

“Unfortunately, they didn't tell us anything specifically, we learned of everything through automated emails that could not be responded to,” they continued.

Samourai is only available for Android, in part because it can’t pin down iOS developers who “are willing to work for the passion of it over the profit,” the representative indicated. The project hasn’t “had much luck with iOS developers so far,” but it is “committed to bringing some version of Samourai to the iOS store eventually,” they claimed.

With these restrictions, Samourai lamented the changing landscape of Android over the past few versions. These changes have, in Samourai’s words, created a “walled garden,” something the wallet provider discusses in its blog post and reiterated in our correspondence.

“Very strict changes in background data a few versions ago meant that Samourai users would no longer receive alerts on incoming payments unless we routed all alerts through Google’s own servers. We obviously decided not to do that, but that was — in our view — the beginnings of the walled garden being built. The latest policy changes regarding SMS and Dialer permissions show a marked change of strategy for Google, bringing it closer in alignment with the Apple iOS Store than ever before.”

If users opt to download the wallet directly from Samourai’s Github, the team cautioned that they should “verify the integrity of the APK they download by comparing the SHA-256 hash of their APK with the SHA-256 hash published on Github.”

2019/1/30,"Phishing Scam Hits LocalBitcoins, Clients Lose Funds","On January 26, 2019, clients of peer-to-peer bitcoin trading service LocalBitcoins were the targets of a phishing scam which resulted in the theft of a handful of bitcoins.

The Scam’s Operation
Reports claimed that the attacker was able to conduct the scam thanks to a security vulnerability on the LocalBitcoins platform. The landing page of the site’s forum reportedly was hacked, leading clients to a phishing site.

The phishing site was designed to carefully mimic the features of the actual LocalBitcoins landing page. Once on it, users were prompted to log in and provide their sensitive, two-factor authentication codes.

As soon as the hackers gained access to the codes, the users had the bitcoins in their wallet stolen.

“We would like to inform that today 26.01.2019 at approximately 10:00:00 UTC, LocalBitcoins has detected a security vulnerability – an unauthorized source was able to access and send transactions from a number of affected accounts. Outgoing transactions were temporarily disabled while we investigated the case,” LocalBitcoins noted in a Reddit post.

A user who claimed to have been hacked was able to identify the address of the hacker, and it was later found that the address has received a total of 7.95205862 BTC from five, separate transactions (equivalent to about $28,134 at press time).

LocalBitcoins Safe Again?
According to an announcement made by LocalBitcoins on Reddit, the exchange claims that the vulnerability to their system surfaced from flaws in a third-party software the exchange uses for its forum. In addition to that, LocalBitcoins stated that its security team was able to find and extinguish the issue quickly.

It confirmed that the vulnerability allowed the attacker to gain access to an undisclosed number of accounts, although at press time, it only knew of six cases where users had been affected.

It was reported that the exchange mitigated the vulnerability by blocking user access to their wallets until the issue was resolved. Also, the exchange suspended trading activities for a short period while its developers worked on neutralizing the threat. The platform was returned to full functionality a few hours after the hack.

The team noted that the vulnerability was fixed. However, there was no mention of whether or not affected users will be compensated for their losses and how they intend to track the stolen bitcoins.

The post also noted that the platform’s forum feature would remain disabled for security reasons, so for now, buyers and sellers will only be able to interact through the platform’s ciphered P2P chat.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.9747
2019/2/6,Blockstream Open Sources Development of Its Proof of Reserves Tool,"On February 4, 2019, blockchain tech company Blockstream announced the development of a “proof of reserves” tool to standardize the authenticity of exchanges’ crypto reserves. The Bitcoin development company has submitted a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) to the bitcoin-dev mailing list for consideration.

Blockstream stated that it is “open-sourcing the development of the tool for feedback from the industry.” Citing high-profile hacks as a reason why such services would be in demand, Blockstream is hoping to create a “best-practice standard Proof of Reserves for the industry, that offers broad compatibility with the way most Bitcoin exchanges are storing their users’ funds.”

Blockstream stated that it the original idea for the tool was to build a means for its Liquid functionaries to prove their Liquid bitcoin (L-BTC) reserves to third-party auditors. But it soon recognized that there were further applications that could reach beyond Liquid and be useful to cryptocurrency exchanges in general.

“Put in as simple terms as possible, Proof of Reserves allows an exchange to prove how many bitcoin they could spend, without needing to generate a ‘live’ transaction or exposing themselves to the risks of moving funds.”

Reducing Security Risks
As the technology is envisioned currently, the tool will be able to circumvent some of the typical problems associated with proving cash reserves, namely the security risks associated with current verification methods that exchanges typically employ. With the help of the tool, an exchange “first constructs a single transaction which spends all of an exchange’s [unspent bitcoin].”

Basically, this function aggregates all of the cryptocurrencies sitting in the exchanges wallets into a transaction, but instead of sending this transaction — and creating a potential attack vector — the tool deliberately “sabotages” it. The transaction still shows that the wallets in question have all of the assets, but none of the assets get moved around. In this way, none of the exchange’s actual assets are at risk of being spent or attacked, and the amount of currency is still verified.

“This transaction data can then be shared with anyone that needs to verify reserves. They simply import the data into their own Proof of Reserves client to confirm the exchange’s total holdings and the addresses associated with those holdings.”

Removing the Need for Trust
The other problem that the Proof of Reserves tool is intended to alleviate is the technical barrier that prevents users from checking on the reserves of an exchange they may want to transact on. In other words, it’s difficult for non-technical users to verify the reserves for themselves, forcing them to trust that the exchange is operating in good faith.

And there have been plenty of questions surrounding the veracity of reserve claims in the crypto space which could make customers uneasy about placing their trust in an exchange. On February 5, 2019, for example, a Canadian court granted cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX bankruptcy protection and appointed Ernst & Young as monitors to help the exchange locate any funds it could use to reimburse its customers.

Following the death of QuadrigaCX’s co-founder and CEO Gerald Cotten, the exchange claims to have lost access to some $190 million in deposited funds, alleging that Cotten was the only one able to access his encrypted laptop where the keys and passwords are stored. This has caused many users to question whether or not the exchange actually has the stated funds in reserve.

Third-party verification of actual cash reserves could help potential users identify whether or not an exchange is operating in good faith and under acceptable standard practices.

Privacy Concerns
Thus far, however, Blockstream’s verification tool has at least one area of significant concern: it reveals the entire transaction history of the participating exchanges. If this problem were to persist, the tool could be used to unmask all of users’ transactions with the exchange in question. Although this glitch would obviously be completely impractical for confidentiality reasons, the underlying premise of the tool does work, and the blog post states that Blockstream hopes to create a fully confidential version with the help of the new open-source development process.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.985
2019/2/19,Coinbase Snaps Up Blockchain Intelligence Startup Neutrino,"U.S.-based digital asset platform Coinbase has acquired blockchain intelligence startup Neutrino. The company made the news known earlier today, February 19, 2019, but the cost of the acquisition was not disclosed.

The announcement reads:

""Neutrino’s technology is the best we’ve encountered in this space, and it will play an important role in legitimizing crypto, making it safer and more accessible for people all over the world.""
The blockchain startup will analyze data on public blockchains and help prevent theft of funds on Coinbase, investigate ransomware attacks when they come up and identify the culprits using its suite of tools.

Neutrino offers similar services to New York-based Chainalysis, designing and developing tools for monitoring data on the blockchain. Per its website, Neutrino creates custom solutions for ""monitoring, analyzing and tracking cryptocurrency flows across multiple blockchains, providing actionable insight on the whole cryptocurrency ecosystem.""

With its analytical capabilities, Neutrino will help Coinbase add new features and tokens to the platform, while ensuring ""compliance with local laws and regulations.""

Beyond analytics, Neutrino claims to have some firepower under its sleeves. The startup has a solution specifically developed for law enforcement agencies dubbed the XFlow nSpect, which allows for total tracking of cryptocurrency movements across multiple blockchains. Per details on its website, Neutrino claims the XFlow can be used to track stolen funds, monitoring their flow from one exchange to another, mixers and other services in real time.

Coinbase says Neutrino will not go through any rebranding efforts. Instead it will continue to operate as an independent entity out of Coinbase's London office. The exchange sees the acquisition as a step in the right direction for creating an ""open financial system.""",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.4767
2019/2/25,“Clear and Robust Strategy” Nets 0.023% Recovery of Bitfinex’s Hacked Funds (So Far),"According to an official statement published on February 25, 2019, Bitfinex has revealed that the United States government returned 27.7 BTC (worth about $105,000 USD) to the exchange, as part of restitution for a hack that was effected on the exchange back in 2016.

The returned tokens represent just 0.023 percent of the bitcoin stolen in the infamous 2016 hack.

Bitfinex said that U.S. federal law enforcement informed them in November of last year that it had obtained access to the stolen funds.

Bitfinex CFO Giancarlo Devasini was full of praise for the efforts of law enforcement officers in the recovery, stating:

Over two years following the hack of the Bitfinex platform, today we see the results of a clear and robust response strategy and the efforts of the U.S. government. It gives us great pleasure to be able to reimburse our traders that were loyal to us and believed in us at a very difficult time.
Devasini also reiterated the exchange’s willingness to help investigators in their inquiries, calling on individuals with useful information about the hack to reach out so they can “finally resolve the situation in a mutually beneficial manner.”

The Hack and Bitfinex’s Retrieval Efforts
Two years ago, the crypto community woke up to the news of 119,756 BTC stolen from the wallets of Bitfinex in one of the largest crypto exchange hacks since Mt. Gox was breached in 2014.

The exchange had generalized the losses across all accounts, crediting BFX tokens for every dollar lost in the hack. Tokens were redeemed for a dollar or exchanged for the company’s stocks — those who chose to hold shares had their BFX tokens converted into Recovery Right Tokens (RRT).

Per the announcement, the recovered tokens are currently being converted to USD and will be paid to holders of RRT.

“The benefit to RRT holders is that in the event of any retrieval of the stolen property, and after any outstanding or unconverted BFX token holders have been reimbursed, recovered funds are distributed to RRT holders, up to 1 dollar per RRT,” the statement reads.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.0772
2019/2/27,Cryptopia Calculates That 9.4 Percent of Assets Stolen in January Hack,"The New Zealand-based crypto asset exchange Cryptopia has made their assessment of a January hack, claiming that up to 9.4 percent of all their assets were stolen.

In January 2019, the exchange went offline after publicly reporting a “major security breach,” which likely resulted in a theft of at least $3 million USD. Promising to involve several of the nation’s law enforcement agencies, Cryptopia’s announcement also stated that all of the exchange’s functionality and trading services would be suspended until further notice.

The exchange, as well as Cryptopia’s website, are still down in late February. Users have been left largely in the dark as to any updates on the site’s functionality or Cryptopia’s plans to deal with the fallout of this hack.

On February 26, 2019, the exchange’s Twitter account began posting several updates to the situation. First, they claimed to have calculated a worst-case scenario for January’s hack: up to 9.4 percent of all holdings in the exchange. Later that same day, tweets on the account suggested that the exchange is making preparations to reopen trading by securing individual accounts, though a later tweet instructs users to not deposit any further funds into their old wallet addresses. Cryptopia’s Twitter account is promising future updates to come regarding the site’s reopening.

According to a Chainalysis report issued at the beginning of February 2019, it is likely that this hack and several others were perpetrated by two groups, dubbed “Alpha” and “Beta.” These hackers displayed a sophisticated method of funneling stolen crypto assets into a variety of wallets and exchanging said assets into fiat without leaving a trail that investigators could follow.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.3612
2019/2/28,"Grim Stories of Ethical, Privacy Abuses Emerge About Coinbase’s New Partners","When Coinbase acquired Neutrino for an unspecified amount in February 2019, the news looked like business as usual: A cryptocurrency juggernaut had made another acquisition. But the company in question, specifically the ties it has to the unethical practices of one of its predecessors, suggests that the monolithic Coinbase may be joining the oligarchic ranks of its privacy-hostile, too-big-for-consumer-comfort counterparts in legacy tech.

The Ties That Damn
On its website, Italian blockchain analysis company Neutrino proudly advertises that its proprietary software offers all-in-one “solutions for law enforcement” and “financial services.” Its two flagships, XFlow nSpect and XFlow nSight, are billed as “comprehensive solution[s] for monitoring[,] analyzing and tracking cryptocurrency flows across multiple blockchains.” nSight was built to help exchanges and financial service companies like Coinbase to stay regulatorily compliant. nSpect, on the other hand, was built for “criminal investigations and intelligence gathering” and is specifically marketed toward law enforcement.

Continuing on with their work at Coinbase, the Neutrino team, a three-man show consisting of CEO Giancarlo Russo, CRO Marco Valleri and CTO Alberto Ornaghi, are no strangers to building complex computer monitoring software for law agencies.

In another life, they did it as Hacking Team, the notorious Italian software services firm whose dubious business practices made them an antagonist of the wider tech and privacy community. Hacking Team got their start when Valleri and Ornaghi (under the aliases NaGa and ALoR) sold man-in-the-middle attack software to the police force of Milan, Italy, in 2003. These two founders would later be joined by Russo, who acted as COO of the company.

Throughout its history, Hacking Team sold its services to oppressive regimes in Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Sudan, Kazakhstan, Bahrain and Turkey, among others. These services centered around Hacking Team’s proprietary Remote Control System (RCS) software, a Trojan horse malware that gives users the ability to remotely access files, record keystrokes, take photos and read emails from any infected device.

Email leaks reported by The Intercept trace the team’s cyber footprints to human rights abuses around the world. Hacking Team’s RCS technology was used by the Ethiopian government (which ranks as one of the most oppressive in Africa, with a penchant for silencing free speech) to surveil and interfere with the operations of Ethiopian Satellite Television and Radio, a news outlet run by Ethiopian expats. The technology helped the Turkish government to spy on an American, and it was also sold to the Sudanese National Intelligence and Security Service in 2012 for a whopping €960,000 (around $1,210,000 at the time), though the team shuttered Sudan’s access to their software in 2014 when the government’s clumsy implementation of the software showed that they weren’t “enough prepared for the product usage,” Hacking Team emails reveal. It also played its part in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia and the assault and arrest of UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor.

Reporters Without Borders labeled Hacking Team as one of five “Enemies of the Internet” in 2013 for its role in humanitarian abuses against journalists.

During the 2012 uprisings in Morocco that were inspired by the Arab Spring movement, RCS, under the control of the Moroccan government, singled out Mamfakinch.com, an outlet that published journalists who were vocal critics of the regime. The leaked emails prove that Hacking Team had been selling its software to Morocco since 2010. This would culminate in Mamfakinch’s hardware being infected by a Trojan horse virus, which originally masqueraded as a news tip.

“Mamfakinch.com came as the first citizen media portal to document protests, providing tools like mapping of protests and also articles. At the time it started, I was not a member. I was asked to join later by one of the co-founders,” Zineb, a pro-democracy activist who was involved with Mamfakinch, told Bitcoin Magazine.

The outlet employed the help of the Citizen Lab to dismantle the virus and trace it back to its Hacking Team source, though most of the damage had already been done by the time they consulted this help.

“Moroccan activists suffer tremendously from what government surveillance provides them with, and former ones like myself have seen what that can be like. From physical threats to family threats, and even worse threats to fellow activists who were part of the human rights and digital rights effort in Morocco,” she said.

Hacking Team repeatedly refused to disclose its clients, and the internal emails betray that, more often than not, when their ties to human rights abuses and oppressive regimes were unearthed by international media, they always tried to mitigate the scrutiny and severity of the ensuing bad press.

In June of 2014, a U.N. panel inquired into Hacking Team’s business with Sudan for violating sanctions regarding weapons exports to the country. The U.N. considered Hacking Team’s software a weapon of sorts, something that Russo refutes in internal emails while also emphasizing that the team wants to keep its name clear from any records regarding the investigation.

“It looks like their focus is to trace every single armament,” wrote Russo. “We absolutely need to avoid being mentioned in these documents.”

Why Coinbase (and We) Should Care
The U.N. investigative panel would mark the beginning of Hacking Team’s unraveling. By March 2016, the Italian government revoked Hacking Team’s export license after an Italian PhD student was murdered in Cairo, Egypt. Hacking Team’s software was allegedly involved in the crime. With the company’s revenue streams severely restricted, Hacking Team was on its last financial leg.

Conveniently, Neutrino was founded the same year that Italian officials revoked Hacking Team’s export license, “very obviously around the time that they would have been desperate for money and needing to start fresh somehow,” Janine, a member of crypto podcast Block Digest who initially raised the alarm about Hacking Team and Neutrino’s ties, told Bitcoin Magazine.

Bitcoin Magazine spoke to Janine to learn more about the possible ramifications of this acquisition. In addition to her work at Block Digest, Janine has been a consistent and reliable whistleblower for industry developments that could indicate privacy threats. In the past, she also helped dissect community concerns surrounding the privacy implications of Bitfury’s Peach Lightning suite.

As with the Bitfury situation, Janine has covered every angle of Neutrino and Hacking Team’s shared past on Twitter, and she helped Block Digest produce a two-hour segment on the subject, as well. Since Neutrino was acquired by Coinbase, the team is more than financially secure. Furthermore, as part of the deal, it will continue to act autonomously out of Coinbase’s London office. The exchange framed the buyout as a means to outfit itself with the proper tools to remain KYC- and AML-compliant with regulators. Janine points out that the company will likely make use of XFlow nSight to this end, though she’s also worried that Neutrino’s technology will come with more serious privacy trade-offs than nSight’s base functionality.

“The chain analysis stuff is not really that interesting to me; it is how much access Coinbase will give to Neutrino,” she told Bitcoin Magazine.

More specifically, she expressed concern about Money Module, a Hacking Team software that allows the user to access devices and private keys. Janine is also suspicious of the backdoors that Hacking Team coded into their software: “They likely had access to whatever data these government clients were collecting from their targets.”

If Coinbase forks over too much data to Neutrino for transaction analysis, and if a backdoor to the software exists in tandem with Money Module, this could spell disaster for user privacy and private key security.

That this backdoor may exist alongside a vehicle for stealing user funds is disturbing — even more disturbing, Janine and other critics have suggested, is Coinbase’s ability to overlook the history of unethical business practices of Neutrino’s team.

When Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Coinbase to ask about the acquisition and how it plans to use Neutrino, the exchange sent back a general statement, indicating that they are aware of and don’t condone Hacking Team’s practices. But this past behavior is not enough for Coinbase to distance themselves from a team whose expertise is in line with its vision. Zineb, who is also a crypto enthusiast, told us that it’s disheartening to see the same privacy-compromising and autocratic software eke its way into the cryptocurrency space. You expect this from the legacy tech industry, she expressed, but you don’t expect it in an industry whose tenets rest on privacy, freedom and censorship resistance.

“To have Coinbase acquire anything run by anyone ever associated with Hacking Team is alarming,” she said. “Perhaps Coinbase is clueless as to WHY it’s important to protect [these virtues], but I’m not. When banks freeze or easily hand over private financial information of dissidents in autocratic countries, that’s when a system like [Bitcoin] is needed.

“They say this is to protect user data. But how can they possibly trust that those who engaged in such appalling actions would somehow have Coinbase user data privacy’s best interest at heart? I can’t say much for others but I can only speak for myself: I won’t be using any of their tools in the future, and shame on them for allowing the Hacking Team people to continue to thrive.""",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.8953
2019/3/4,Coinbase Bought Neutrino Because Its Old Analysis Providers Sold User Data,"Coinbase’s Director of Institutional Sales, Christine Sandler, said in an interview last week that, in part, the exchange acquired controversial software firm Neutrino because its prior blockchain analysis providers were selling customer data.

“The compelling reason for making the acquisition was that Neutrino had some industry leading, best in class technology. It was important for us to migrate away from our current providers. They were selling client data to outside sources and it was compelling for us to get control over that and have proprietary technology that we could leverage to keep the data safe and protect our clients,” Sandler said in an interview with Cheddar.

In its current privacy policy, Coinbase asserts that it only shares customer information with third parties for fraud prevention and legal compliance as well as for “bill collection, marketing, and other technology services.” The same active policy says that they will personally never sell client information, transaction or personal, and nor will these third parties.Sandler’s slip up tells another tale. If her statement is true, then Coinbase may have inadvertently violated its terms of use. Coinbase users believed that their data was only being shared for regulatory purpose, not being monetized, as Jill Carlson points out on Twitter:

“Selling data is very different from collecting it for regulatory purposes. I consented to Coinbase collecting my data for KYC/AML purposes. I did not knowingly consent to Coinbase collecting my data to sell to other parties.”

Seeing as their prior providers breached this trust, Coinbase’s acquisition of Neutrino makes sense; out with the old and in with the (hopefully more trustworthy) new. In one of its news blurbs, cryptocurrency media platform Messari indicates that the purchase was likely made to minimize counterpart risk by bringing analysis services in house. Most all other exchanges use the same providers, a source told Messari, so going with the new kid on the block was likely the only way Coinbase could make sure the provider would do as they’re told.

“A source with knowledge of the situation explained there wasn't much of a choice for Coinbase, as almost all regulated crypto exchanges likely use one of several large blockchain analytics tools, including those from industry leaders Elliptic and Chainalysis. The source said that those firms had moved to a ‘give-get’ data model, where Coinbase would only have been permitted to use the service in return for providing its own data. Coinbase ‘brought that capability in house so they weren’t in a situation where using a 3rd party tool was making it better’ as a surveillance tech.”

Still, if Coinbase was looking for a team it could trust, Neutrino’s past is far from trustworthy. The company’s three executives used to run a business called Hacking Team, which sold surveillance malware to authoritarian regimes around the world which precipitated, among other human rights abuses, the monitoring, imprisonment and death of journalists and regime dissidents.

Neutrino’s past has it and Coinbase embroiled in intense community scrutiny, and the collective ire has manifested in a #DeleteCoinbase campaign on Twitter.

Coinbase claims that Neutrino offer best-in-class software, hence why they’re the best fit for AML/KYC compliance and other business-related transaction analysis. But even disregarding the questions of trust that Neutrino’s past may muster, the company’s pedigree might not even be all that up-to-snuff.

Jesse Powell, CEO of Kraken exchange, said that Neutrino was disqualified “due [to its] risks” in a compliance evaluation. Even without this risk, they came in last for actual product when compared to four other providers.

“I asked our Compliance team what they thought of Neutrino,” Powell tweeted. “Fortunately, they'd just completed an evaluation. Neutrino came in last place on product (out of the 5) but was disqualified anyway due to the risks. However, other factors are important in M&A: cost, culture fit.”

BHB Network head Giacomo Zucco told Bitcoin Magazine that his company gave a negative evaluation of Neutrino’s services for similar reasons that Kraken’s compliance review raised red flags. Zucco told Bitcoin Magazine that, when BHB Network evaluated a live demo of Neutrino’s blockchain analysis technology for a client in February 2017, the company refused to let BHB test the tech using their own addresses.

The demo was conducted using “pre-defined addresses,” he said, and the team argued that they couldn’t open source the software because the technology had its own “secret” algorithm that they couldn’t give away.

“We didn't actually get so far. After the demo, I had some doubts about the ‘secret source’ claims. Then we googled names and that was enough for me to tell my client to pass,” Zucco told Bitcoin Magazine.

2019/3/5,"Reacting to Public Ire, Coinbase Drops Neutrino Execs With Hacking Team Ties","After a week of community discontent, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has decided to sever its business relationship with Neutrino employees who previously worked at the notorious Italian malware/software provider Hacking Team.

Blaming “a gap in [Coinbase’s] diligence process,” CEO Brian Armstrong writes in a Medium post that Coinbase “did not properly evaluate everything from the perspective of our mission and values as a crypto company.”Last week, Neutrino’s link to Hacking Team came to light thanks to Twitter commentators like Block Digest’s “Janine.” At least three individuals in Neutrino’s core team (CEO Giancarlo Russo, CRO Marco Valleri and CTO Alberto Ornaghi) had been principal employees of Hacking Team, as well as Luca Guerre, an intern-turned-software-engineer at the company.

Coinbase did not disclose which team members would be let go, so there’s no information to indicate how many other Neutrino employees might be affected by the severance. Armstrong also offered no timeline in his post for when these departures would take place.

Disbanded in 2016, Hacking Team made headlines during its business’ zenith for selling surveillance malware to authoritarian governments. Their software’s use has been implicated in inumerable privacy and human rights abuses, including the death and imprisonment of journalists and civil rights activists.

News of Hacking Team’s abuses spread like wildfire through the community, in part stoked by tenacious media coverage and social media backlash, culminating in a #DeleteCoinbase campaign.

And apparently, this heat was enough for Coinbase to decide to dissolve its connections with the people previously associated with Hacking Team.

Previously, the exchange had defended its acquisition in a blanket statement sent to the press. Coinbase stated that it “does not condone nor will it defend the actions of Hacking Team,” but that it was “important for [it] to bring [blockchain analysis services] in-house to fully control and protect our customers' data, and Neutrino’s technology was the best we encountered in the space to achieve this goal.”

A few days after this response to the situation, Coinbase’s Director of Institutional Sales, Christine Sandler, would tell Cheddar that the need to bring these services in-house to protect data was due to its former blockchain analysis providers monetizing user data, something that is against Coinbase’s privacy policy.

In his post, Armstrong mentions that Neutrino was also acquired because their old providers didn’t support all the assets [the exchange] wanted to have on [its] platform,” so it “examined the players, found that Neutrino had some of the best technology in this area, and decided to acquire them.”",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.9629
2019/3/6,"Coinbase Purchased Neutrino for $13.5 M, Acquisition Contract Shows","Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase purchased controversial Italian software services provider Neutrino for $13.5 million (€12 million), a copy of a legal document dated February 15, 2019, and shared with Bitcoin Magazine reveals. The hard numbers of the acquisition were previously unknown.

The document leak comes after a week of turbulent developments following the February 19 acquisition. Community members, namely Block Digest podcast member Janine, began to raise ethical concerns stemming from the company’s shared past with Hacking Team, an Italian, man-in-the-middle software provider whose malware and spyware has been linked to human rights and privacy abuses around the globe.

This revelation invoked strong reactions among some community members, eventually manifesting in the #DeleteCoinbase movement. Coinbase ultimately buckled under the mounting pressure, announcing that it would be parting ways with Neutrino staff with ties to Hacking Team. Per the deal, Neutrino would “continue to operate as a standalone business based out of [Coinbase’s] London office,” meaning CRO Marco Valleri, CTO Alberto Ornaghi and CEO Giancarlo Russo were originally slated to stay on as executives until the severance.

Marco Valleri and Alberto Ornaghi were both founders of Hacking Team, and Neutrino’s CEO, Giancarlo Russo, joined Hacking Team in 2004 as COO. At their new company, each executive held 22 percent of its shares — in capital allocation, $5,650 each (€5,000). The other 33 percent of shares, valued at $8,500 (€7,500), was held by 360 Capital, a French-Italian venture capital firm registered in Paris which invested $565,000 (€500,000) in the project in April 2017.

The document says that Coinbase agreed to purchase “the units of the respective total ownership representing the entire share capital of the Company.” Proportional to their shares in Neutrino, from the acquisition, Ornaghi, Russo and Valleri will each receive $2,951,792.91 (€2,608,916.11), while 360 Capital will receive $4,993,401.86 (€4,413,374.16). On the day the contract was signed, the acquisition’s notary paid each executive $487,045 (€430,471) and 360 Capital $4,055,107 (€3,584,071). The remaining $8,332,534 (€7,364,637) was transferred to a Credit Suisse trust account associated with the company, though it’s unclear how or when the remaining capital will be disbursed to the former shareholders.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.9524
2019/3/26,"Singapore’s DragonEx Reports Hack, Releases Suspected Wallet Addresses","The Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange DragonEx has announced a security breach to its users via its official Telegram channel. In the message, a company administrator revealed that the hackers stole assets belonging to both the exchange and its users.

Per the message from the admin, the attack occurred on March 24, 2019, and the exchange then decided to take its servers offline under the pretense of “system maintenance/upgrade.” A day after, users were notified on Telegram that the exchange had been hacked.

“Part of the assets were retrieved back, and we will do our best to retrieve back the rest of stolen assets,” the message read. “Several Judicial administrations were informed about this cybercrime case including Estonia, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, etc., and we’re assisting policemen to do investigation. All platform services will be closed and the accurate assets loss recovery situation will be announced in a week.”

Earlier today, the company shared the wallet addresses suspected to contain the stolen funds.

The total amount of funds stolen is still unknown. However, an analysis of the Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) wallet addresses provided by the company shows balances of 1,522 ETH (worth about $202,730 USD) and 135 BTC (worth about $528,855 USD), respectively.

The full list of suspected wallet addresses provided by DragonEx includes those of popular exchanges including Bittrex, Huobi and Binance.

DragonEx has asked for assistance from other trading platforms and wallet providers within the industry as it works to recover from the hack.

“We earnestly request help from all our fellow exchanges and other industry strength, please help us to investigate and traced the assets, freeze them and stop the assets flows,” per the Telegram message listing the suspected wallet addresses.

At press time, DragonEx is the 32nd largest exchange in the world by 24-hour trade volumes, trading over $180 million in the last 24 hours.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.2263
2019/3/26,Samourai Wallet Adds Tor Integration in Privacy Push,"Samourai Wallet announced this month that its latest update supports Tor integration, offering additional privacy for users.

What Does Tor Integration Enable?
In a conversation with Bitcoin Magazine, Samourai’s lead developer, who is known simply as “TD,” gave a rundown of the Tor integration. He explained that using the Tor integration before creating a new wallet can shield a user’s identity beyond the fact that they are not required to provide any personal information. With Tor, Samourai’s servers will not be able to see a user’s IP address when they connect to the API, only their Bitcoin addresses, thus protecting the one piece of information that could tie their wallet to their real-world identity.

He also noted that Tor-enabled connectivity paves the way for Samourai’s forthcoming Whirlpool mixing services and full-node Dojo offering, two more privacy-enhancing features.

“Our users have been requesting tighter Tor integration for some time,” TD explained. “It was a prerequisite for rolling out Whirlpool and Dojo.”

Whirlpool is Samourai’s implementation of ZeroLink, a coin-mixing protocol that has been anticipated since 2017. ZeroLink’s protocol demands the use of Tor, enabling Whirlpool to break chain analysis between incoming and outgoing coins. This shuffling helps to ensure privacy and further secure anonymity of the origin source of an outgoing transaction.

Samourai’s wallet-specific full node, Dojo, has been tailor-made to run over a Tor-only connection. This further establishes privacy, as the personal Dojo will include backend APIs that allow the Samourai Wallet to connect to the Dojo directly, bypassing the company’s own servers. The intent is to provide greater security and verification measures for users. The Samourai website claims that the full-node Dojo will sport an easy-to-use interface.

Samourai has also planned for a directory of PayNyms, a feature that provides users with stealth addresses to send transactions anonymously between other Samourai Wallet users.

Tor Has Its Issues
TD acknowledged that Tor integration could make for a slower network than others under certain conditions, though he suggested that “Tor users [would] readily accept that tradeoff.”

Other concerns relating to the Tor network might include the fact that it is blocked in certain locations and/or by certain internet service providers.

Regardless of its limitations, the privacy potential makes Tor essential to Samourai Wallet’s near future.

“Connectivity over Tor is now an integral part of Samourai Wallet and will be maintained in an important position within our code base as we move forward,” TD said.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.9771
2019/3/26,VeriBlock’s Bitcoin-Backed Security Protocol Goes Live,"After a year on its testnet, the VeriBlock blockchain went live yesterday on the Bitcoin mainnet, allowing exchanges, wallet providers, merchants and other crypto businesses to leverage Bitcoin’s robust blockchain security.

Now that it’s live on the mainnet, VeriBlock’s model extends the Bitcoin blockchain’s security protection from 51-percent attacks to non-Bitcoin blockchains by linking them to the Bitcoin blockchain, offering it as a security backstop.

How Does VeriBlock Work?
VeriBlock allows any blockchain to inherit the full proof-of-work security of Bitcoin using a novel consensus protocol — proof of proof — which records snapshots of any given blockchain and embeds them (in an aggregated form) in Bitcoin transactions, allowing the former to inherit the latter’s security characteristics.

These snapshots can be automatically referenced by the protocol in the event of a 51-percent attack to determine the correct chain. The presence of conflicting snapshots for a particular “altchain” triggers early attack detection (EAD) metrics, which warns users about the potential rewrite before they confirm the transaction and updates them when the transaction is safe to accept.

VeriBlock uses OP_RETURN — a type of bitcoin transaction that is used for embedding data on the blockchain. It can be used for anything from proving the existence of some data at a specific point in time (proof of existence) to issuing new assets, all on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.

“A ‘regular’ Bitcoin transaction and one carrying a VeriBlock publication need not be mutually exclusive,” VeriBlock CTO Max Sanchez said. “It would be a relatively simple engineering matter to add an option in a Bitcoin wallet that said ‘Sending BTC? Secure the crypto-ecosystem with VeriBlock and subsidize your BTC transaction fee.’”

Does VeriBlock Create Problems for Bitcoin?
There have been estimates of the percentage of the Bitcoin blockspace used by VeriBlock that range from 20 percent of the network to as high as 45 percent. This may raise some concerns about how VeriBlock will affect the network.

“This was widely reported right before the VeriBlock testnet was phased out,” Sanchez said. “However, the effects of proof of proof on the Bitcoin network are actually very small … As demand for bitcoin transactions increases and users are willing to bid higher fees, the amount of space VeriBlock consumes in Bitcoin will shrink — the two economic forces result in an equilibrium.”

Sanchez also noted that VeriBlock’s solution offers security regardless of Bitcoin’s transaction frequency at a given time.

“The natural ebb-and-flow of VeriBlock transaction volume on Bitcoin does not affect the security characteristics of VeriBlock or VeriBlock-secured altchains, nor does it adversely affect Bitcoin,” he said.

Jameson Lopp, CTO of Casa, has been observing VeriBlock’s activity on Bitcoin’s testnet for over a year.

During an episode of the HSHR8 podcast on March 20, 2019, Lopp said that he doesn’t see the VeriBlock venture as an attack on the Bitcoin network, as some might, but he wondered about the economics of spending millions in fees to provide security.

“If you’re paying the fees to put it in the blockchain and you convince some miners to put it in, then there might be some economic rationality for this,” he said. Lopp also noted that he can see “the value of having a data anchor” for Bitcoin.

“We believe that VeriBlock elegantly expands Bitcoin’s usefulness and does so in a way that doesn’t result in a burden on the network,” VeriBlock CEO Justin Fisher told Bitcoin Magazine. “It drives demand for Bitcoin and also, in its own way, helps make Bitcoin more secure while maximizing the utility derived from Bitcoin’s energy consumption.”

In an announcement on March 25, 2019, Matt Roszak, Bloq co-founder; Anthony Di Iorio, founder and CEO of Decentral; and Bill Shihara, co-founder and CEO of Bittrex, all commended VeriBlock on its innovative new protocol, expecting it to add a new level of security to the blockchain ecosystem.

""Bloq is proud to have been part of the journey with VeriBlock over the past two years — and especially with a technology that helps any blockchain project thrive and benefit from the security that Bitcoin provides,” Roszak wrote on his company blog. “As the multi-chain, multi-network, multi-token world emerges, we are confident that VeriBlock will continue to play a vital role as a security root for this new frontier.""

The vice president of crypto exchange BitBuy, Jordan Anderson, also praised the solution in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine.

“VeriBlock is an excellent example of a proof-of-proof initiative to ensure altcoins are not susceptible to a 51-percent attack,” he said. “VeriBlock will promote security and stability within the altcoin ecosystem, and provide greater confidence to consumers looking to participate.”

Meanwhile, long-time bitcoin core developer Peter Todd was more apprehensive, explaining that he needed time to look at the actual implementation of the VeriBlock project.

“The general idea of piggybacking on an existing consensus system is a good one,” he said. “But VeriBlock is an unusually complex variant of that idea, so I'm not confident given what I've seen in the white paper that it is secure.”",PRIVACY & SECURITY,0.34
2019/4/1,Lazarus Hacker Group Continues to Target Crypto Using Faked Trading Software,"The Chinese security service provider 360 Security has issued a warning that a large number of crypto exchanges have been targeted by the North Korean hacker group Lazarus and that the number is still rising after the recent hacks of crypto exchanges DragonEx, Etbox and BiKi.

360 Core Security found that Lazarus, also known as the ATP-C-26 group, used software called “Worldbit-bot” to carry out its active attacks. The crypto exchange DragonEx fell victim to it on March 24, 2019, leading to a loss of $7.09 million, according to the 360 Security report.

The analysis by the 360 Advanced Threat Response Team detailed that the attacking group registered two domains, wb-invest.net and wb-bot.org, last October in preparation for the attacks. Then they faked the cryptocurrency trading software Worldbit-bot based on the open-sourced “Qt Bitcoin Trader,” which was embedded with malicious code. The malicious software was then camouflaged within a regular automated crypto trading platform under the domains of wb-invest.net and wb-bot.org, which kept normal operation for half a year. The attackers targeted a large number of internal staff at cryptocurrency exchanges for the software promotion. The latest phishing attacks took place in January and March 2019.

According to China-based JohnWick Security, which has been assisting DragonEx in investigating its hacking incident, the customer service staff at DragonEx appear to have opened an installation package named wbbot.dmg from an unknown source. Analysis indicates a backdoor was embedded in the installation package, through which hackers acquired the internal staff’s authorization and then obtained the wallet private key.

The “Worldbit-bot” software operates in much the same manner, with the faked crypto trading software “Celas Trade Pro,” and was detected by the same team at 360 Security last August. Users of Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Bitmarket, BTCChina, GOC.io, Indacoin, OKCoin, WEX and Y0bit were susceptible to the threat at that time.

First, the process information is collected and encrypted.System information is collected, Malicious codes are executed and decrypted for file execution. The security company is recommending that crypto exchanges be on the lookout for warning signs such as abnormal exchange earnings, tampered addresses of cold and hot wallets, large sum transfers and multiple account logins for coin withdrawal.

Lazarus is an infamous hacking group backed by North Korea. According to research, the group’s earliest attack may have been associated with “Operation Flame,” a large-scale DDOS attack on the South Korean government website in 2007. Lazarus is also alleged to have been the group behind the Sony Pictures hacking incident of 2014, the Bank of Bangladesh data breach of 2016 and the “Wannacry” ransomware attack that swept across the globe in 2017. Since 2017, the group has been expanding its targets of attack, increasingly aiming them at a variety of economic interests. In earlier attacks, the group mainly targeted the banking systems of traditional financial institutions. Now, it has begun to attack global cryptocurrency businesses and individuals.

As previously reported, Lazarus is purportedly responsible for $571 million of the $882 million in cryptocurrency that was stolen from exchanges from 2017 to 2018, almost 65 percent of the total amount. Out of 14 exchange attacks, five were attributed to the group, including the industry record-breaking $532 million NEM hack of Japan’s Coincheck.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.9834
2019/4/10,Electrum Servers Remain Under Sustained DoS Attack,"Electrum servers are still under a sustained Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack. The wallet developers announced the issue on April 7, 2018.

In correspondence with Bitcoin Magazine, Electrum developer Thomas Voegtlin speculated that the attack may be a form of retaliation from a phishing attacker who has been targeting Electrum in recent weeks. Since his phishing attacks had been thwarted, the attacker could now be resorting to DoS attacks instead, simply to frustrate Electrum developers and users. Voegtlin pointed out that, if this is the case, the behavior “is not rational” given the incumbent waste of the attacker’s resources.

A DoS attack is a fairly straightforward means of disrupting server activity, usually carried out by flooding a server with frivolous requests from a variety of different sources to overwhelm its processing capacity. Attacks of this nature can be carried out by an individual or by a number of actors, as the key method of attack is simply to overwhelm the server itself.

When a DoS attack targets a light wallet such as Electrum, it exploits the fact that users do not need to run their own nodes or connect directly to the Bitcoin network and, instead, connect to Electrum servers. By overwhelming these servers with DoS attacks, the wallets become less usable, as it takes a while to find a working server.

It’s also possible that the DoS is being carried out by the same person (or group) that was behind the phishing attacks in hopes that the DoS attack will increase the chance that the phishing attack can still succeed this way. As part of the phishing scam, users would connect to fraudulent servers. These fraudulent servers would then send users a phony message asking them to update to a new version of Electrum, sending a link to download coin-stealing malware. Voegtlin speculated that, by adding a DoS attack, the attacker may be hoping to overwhelm the legitimate servers of Electrum, making it more likely that users will inadvertently connect to the malicious servers.

Voegtlin suggested that the phishing attack is very unlikely to succeed, however: First, because the phishing attack only works on non-updated Electrum clients, and second, it only works if these clients connect only to malicious servers. Since clients always connect to 10 servers, that is very unlikely, he said. If even one of these servers is non-fraudulent, the phishing attempt will fail.

According to Voegtlin, while there is no ETA for the total fix for the DoS attacks, they are already being countered.

""We spawned more servers and we found how to blacklist botnet IP addresses,” he said. “That means some servers are usable now."" Electrum also plans to ban data-heavy clients as a way of curtailing the processing overload.

Updated versions of Electrum are not at risk of the phishing malware, but they can be affected by the DoS attack.

For now, Electrum suggests that users ""disable auto-connect and select their server manually."" Simply waiting a short while often does the trick as well.

“Give it time; sometimes it connects after a few minutes,” Voegtlin added. He also advises users to stay on a server that works for them and not switch.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.9911
2019/4/16,South Korean Police Confiscate Server Allegedly Linked to Bithumb Hack,"Last month, the South Korean exchange Bithumb lost about $13 million worth of cryptocurrency to hackers. While it initially appeared unlikely that the funds would ever be recovered, a recent police raid conducted in South Korea is giving hope that some of the money may be returned.

Per reports from a local news outlet, the Cyber ​​Investigation Department of South Korea’s National Police Agency has seized an external server that it believes to be associated with the attack on Bithumb. While at first the theft was believed to be an inside job because no evidence of an external hacker was found, upon closer inspection the police found proof of an external server and IP address that it suspected to be involved. That server has now been found and seized by law enforcement officials.

Details are still sketchy about the culprits of the attack and how they managed to steal millions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency, including 3 million EOS tokens. Local officials believe more details may come to light as police analysts search the hard drive of the seized server and find evidence linked to the person or group behind the crime.

However, according to the officials involved, it’s not going to be easy. Even though blockchain transactions are transparent, one Korean official noted that it will be challenging to track the crime because the perpetrator has used multiple paths to mask their actions.

It won’t help that, globally, many police departments are unequipped to deal with cryptocurrency hacks and that few police officers have a deep understanding of blockchain technology or how it works.

If the police are able to determine who committed the attack and zero in on the perpetrator’s exact location, they might be able to make an arrest and recover some of the lost funds.

The only upside to this hack is that the funds stolen belonged to the exchange, not customers, so retail investors did not lose their coins. Last year, Bithumb suffered a major security breach, which saw hackers steal $30 million worth of cryptocurrencies belonging to users from its wallets.",PRIVACY & SECURITY,-0.9541
