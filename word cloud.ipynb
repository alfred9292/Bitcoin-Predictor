      " New York State Department Financial Services ( NYDFS ) Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky today released final version BitLicense regulations , saying “ gut feeling ” digital currencies stay.The BitLicense program require digital currencies businesses New York state operate license report government long making included two revisions comment periods allow public criticism input.Many felt Lawsky find reasonable balance protecting consumers allowing digital finance innovators develop without unnecessary red tape restrictions.Lawsky Defends Need RegulateSaying often “ seems like technologists Venus regulators Mars , ” Lawsky defended need “ protect consumers ” “ root illicit activities. ” Answering criticism anti-money-laundering fraud regulations already existed , maintained digital financial systems different traditional “ disco era ” banking system ’ fit new reality fintech.Changes Final Version BitLicense FrameworkLawsky said five minor changes BitLicense program second third versions : Companies need report minor changes way business , need report “ material change ” changing making wallets running exchange.Companies working fintech software need report , companies holding people ’ money trust.Companies “ cross satisfy ” different programs . If trust charter , ’ need BitLicense vice versa.Companies reporting suspicious activities federal authorities also report NYDFS. “ Passive investors ” joining companies report get approval . Only “ control person ” need report regulators.Lawsky noted office received 4,000 comments first draft released 35 comments second draft released , figured must closer “ getting right. ” Who covered BitLicense program Businesses covered include “ controlling , administering issuing virtual currency ” following exemptions : Blockchain technology noncurrency purposesSoftware developers ’ engaged directly money transmission exchangeMinersIndividual investorsMerchants accept bitcoinLicensed banksCriticisms Digital Currencies CommunityMany businesses organizations Bitcoin space submitted comments Lawsky ’ office noting regulations would create “ bitcoin backwater ” digital currency businesses simply move elsewhere friendlier jurisdictions.Organizations Coin Center companies Coinbase noted BitLicense rules simply added another layer regulations laws already exist federal level cover money laundering fraud . In addition , many commented Lawsky ’ rules put high financial burden new startups , requiring buy license pay reporting government.The Revolving DoorAs reported earlier , Cato Institute others criticized Lawsky taking advantage role developing BitLicense rules moving private sector offer consultation advice regulations.An anonymous Reddit user self-identifies bank employee posted warning saying bank received memo national financial institute , instructions report anyone receives €1,000 may linked Bitcoin.The five-page memo outlines surveillance works , network monitored says bitcoin exchanges unwilling cooperate authorities . The memo accompanied report , issued E.U . law enforcement agency Europol , stating 84 accounts country ( ’ disclosed ) flagged suspect , 52 surveillance investigation.The poster says earlier related report national financial institute available online.The report Dutch released May 21 , 2015 Dutch Financial Intelligence Unit ( FIU ) -- likely implies undisclosed country The Netherlands.The report mentions bitcoin used technology enthusiasts speculators , also criminals use digital currency fund illicit activities launder money . The report mentions terrorism child pornography . In 2014 FIU investigated 75 cases bitcoin plays important role . The results , led new investigations , shared foreign financial intelligence units.The poster says bank received list IBAN accounts already constantly monitored belong high-volume traders exchanges Kraken , Bitstamp BitcoinD.The bank report transfer €1,000 involves accounts . The bank must also report accounts receive €10,500 per year ( outside salary ) suspects funds originate bitcoin exchanges.Of course , anonymous reports always taken grain salt , warning substantiated openly available report Dutch FIU , makes sense . Now governments taken notice fact bitcoin exists used people , seems evident trying , try , force banks monitor report transactions bitcoin exchanges , well transactions may linked bitcoin.The stated objective governments fight money laundering organized crime , course use hot trigger words “ terrorism ” “ child pornography ” persuade citizens right . Almost everyone hates terrorism child porn , people ’ condone money laundering large-scale tax evasion . But seems odd relatively small transfers €1,000 considered suspect.All bitcoin users know transfer €1,000 bitcoin exchange could investigated monitored . That ’ likely annoy paid bitcoin ( perfectly legitimate work ) must cash pay bills buy food.A good way avoid surveillance , becoming easier , pay directly bitcoin goods services wherever possible.The executive body European Union ( EU ) warned crackdown virtual currencies hopes cutting financing terrorists.Details revealed recently European Commission ’ Action Plan strengthening fight terrorist financing call Bitcoin exchanges come supervision Anti-Money Laundering Directive.If proposed legislation passes , virtual currency exchanges would accountable gathering comprehensive information looking change bitcoin traditional currency. “ We must cut terrorists ’ access funds enable authorities better track financial flows prevent devastating attacks Paris , ” E.U . Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said statement.Forbes argued currency anonymous , transaction documented blockchain . But spokesperson E.C . said public ledgers transparent enough. “ Indeed , public ledgers offer traceability transactions accounts , ” press officer Letizia Lupini explained . “ However , accounts remain anonymous . This anonymity potentially incentive unlawful activities. ” Regulators advocacy groups said education needed , regulation.Jason Weinstein , director Blockchain Alliance , told Bitcoin Magazine restrictions solution. “ Criminals terrorists using sorts technology try hide activities Internet , turn Bitcoin part effort making big mistake , ” said.David Long , principal senior consultant Northern California Fraud Prevention Solutions , said would easier launder euros bitcoins , “ Though initial investigative standpoint , bitcoins might present challenge due necessity uncovering actually responsible given transaction transactions. “ However , actor 's identity uncovered , blockchain makes possible uncover , , person 's transactions , ” Long said . “ This capability without parallel subject dealing euros dollars. ” Bitcoin called “ single , common currency cybercriminals within E.U. , ” 2015 report Europol . Combined claim Reuters bitcoin popular virtual currency , claiming 80 percent European market , wake Paris terrorist attacks , E.U . compelled act. “ With today 's Action Plan moving swiftly clamp terrorist financing , starting legislative proposals coming months , ” Dombrovskis said press release . “ We want improve oversight many financial means used terrorists , cash cultural artifacts virtual currencies anonymous pre-paid cards , avoiding unnecessary obstacles functioning payments financial markets ordinary , law-abiding citizens . `` Yet questions raised whether regulations accomplish E.C . wants. “ Those looking remain hidden buy sell bitcoins likely already avoiding online exchanges . Most exchanges today already following KYC/AML procedures , ” virtual currency expert Michael Yeung said.There also concern tougher regulations could mean small businesses working Bitcoin. “ Regulation desirable required , regulation onerous may end destroying legitimate businesses infancy , ” blockchain researcher consultant CryptolQ , Albert Szmigielski said.Weinstein , director Blockchain Alliance , warned Forbes article complex regulation may pave way black market takeover. “ Regulators appreciate fact Bitcoin companies startups lot resources , ” said . “ The simpler landscape compliance rules , better companies also public regulations protect. ” The new rules announced end June . Countries 2017 put effect.Japanese legislators officially proposed handling virtual currencies methods payment February 23 , Nikkei reports . This would mean virtual money , Bitcoin , would become regulatory equivalent conventional currency.Legislators financial services industry believe move could potentially strengthen consumer protection create growth virtual economy . At moment , Bitcoin recognized “ object , ” considered equal established forms currency.The proposed changes definition virtual currencies would mean items Bitcoin could used purchase goods services . Additionally , would considered exchangeable legal tender via trade purchase.However , acknowledging virtual currency equivalent conventional currency would require certain institutions register Financial Services Agency.This first time Japan examined Bitcoin global use , seen press conference held 2014 . At time , Finance Minister Taro Aso addressed Bitcoin treated Japan , well around world. “ The media may regard , currency everyone recognizes currency , I ’ really know whether Ministry Finance Financial Services Agency jurisdiction something currency , whether Consumer Affairs Agency jurisdiction used consumers , whether National Police Agency jurisdiction crime may committed , ” said Aso . “ In Japan , issue quite advanced , quite time I thought actions might taken Japan , though I think time come much earlier expected. ” Currently , 600 forms virtual currencies used around world . As February 24 , one bitcoin holds value approximately 47,000 Japanese yen.As prominence virtual currencies continues grow , Nikkei reports monetary authorities attempting institute regulations address issues , money laundering.In 2015 , Aso addressed use Bitcoin virtual currencies purpose funding terrorism crimes. “ I think G7 summit discussions addressed need introduce regulations order prevent terrorist funding , tackle money laundering , , ” Aso said . “ We ’ gathered lot information , I think actual ways currencies used need properly reflected , I think studies need continue concerning approach. ” The Japanese financial newspaper Nikkei reported early March country ’ parliament , Diet , soon vote set Bitcoin regulations put forward ruling cabinet.The regulations proposed Finance Minister Taro Aso ruling Liberal Democratic cabinet would classify Bitcoin currency , impose new requirements Bitcoin exchanges allow banks securities firms invest trade virtual currency.Following collapse Mt . Gox early 2014 , largest Bitcoin exchange world , Japan built firewall separating Bitcoin financial sector . Banks barred buying selling bitcoins , securities firms prevented trading virtual currency.The proposed regulations would remove firewall Bitcoin financial sector , according Nikkei . Commercial banks would allowed provide Bitcoin customers , securities firms would allowed trade virtual currency . The government hopes removing firewall encourage development Japan ’ emerging fintech industry.The regulations , passed Diet , would mark first concrete step years-long debate deal Bitcoin . But Diet members pleased proposal.Tsukasa Akimoto , member ruling Liberal Democratic party , asked Finance Minister Aso budget meeting early February maintaining consumption tax Bitcoin transactions would set Japan global trend . In response , Aso cited countries Australia also tax transactions using virtual currency . As proposal stands , Japan would continue levy 8 percent consumption tax purchases made Bitcoin.Continuing tax Bitcoin put Japan disadvantage discourage use consumers , says Yuzo Kano , leader Japan Authority Digital Assets , industry group advocates virtual currencies . Kano says Japan “ going world , ” continuing consumption tax hurt Japan ’ competitiveness emerging fintech ecosystem.According Kano , international Bitcoin traders make business “ importing ” bitcoins Japan untaxed exchanges overseas . Kano calling “ level playing field ” stop importation Bitcoin countries.The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ruled September Bitcoin commodity , empowering agency monitor businesses trade virtual currency . Because Bitcoin classified property United States , states cities levy sales taxes Bitcoin transactions , although none done . On side Atlantic , European Union Court ruled October Bitcoin currency , commodity , therefore taxed.Of Group 7 countries , Japan taxes purchases made Bitcoin . The upcoming G7 meeting May held Japan , regulate virtual currencies set major topic discussion.Whether Japan continues tax Bitcoin transactions , Bitcoin exchanges would face increased scrutiny proposed regulations . Exchanges would meet mandatory minimum capital requirement 10 million yen , keep company customer assets separate submit auditing certified public accountants.Exchanges would also required follow know-your-customer ( KYC ) anti-money laundering ( AML ) rules banks financial service providers , confirming identities clients reporting suspicious trading financial authorities.According Motokazu Endo , attorney specializing financial legislation , many Japan ’ Bitcoin exchanges weak financial bases , proposed regulations could expose.Japan recently made headlines announcing government considering defining Bitcoin digital currencies currency rather commodity.This confirmed Tomonori Kanda , representing financial affairs section Liberation Democratic Party ( LDP ) . He told The Guardian plan bring matter Parliament . Even Mt . Gox fiasco , Japan recognized Bitcoin ’ potential two years ago , asked members within Bitcoin blockchain industry form self-regulatory authority called Japan Authority Digital Assets ( JADA ) . JADA supported LDP ’ IT committee , currently discussion Japanese government offices . There specific governmental office regulates JADA , currently four members : bitFlyer , Orb , Kraken Coincheck , several supporting members Deloitte . JADA meets FSA ( Japanese government organization ntegrated financial regulator responsible overseeing banking , securities exchange insurance sectors ) governmental bodies ( Ministry Economy , Trade Industry Bank Japan ) month , constant discussion National Tax Authority ( NTA ) , police agency governmental offices.Bitcoin Magazine talked JADA ’ legal counsel So Saito , said , “ Our first activity establish self-regulatory rules regarding AML [ anti-money laundering ] , security protection consumer protection . The recent topic ’ discussing new law . “ FSA asked us current situation industry , current issues desired regulation , ” said . “ Some media outlets wrote Bitcoin would regarded currency . I , however , think Japan would regard Bitcoin currency. ” He added : “ I heard FSA submit new regulation lower house March 4 . I yet got actual article . However , another media outlet said cryptocurrency defined ‘ Property value , used person purchases goods , etc . non-specific person electronically transferred. ’ I believe definition close actual definition new regulation. ” As future , Saito said , “ I welcome new Bitcoin [ currency ] regulation . Traditional financial institutions generally hesitant deal Bitcoin ’ currently non-regulated . I expect traditional companies advance [ regulated ] Bitcoin world. “ Traditional financial institutions ( including Japanese megabanks ) eager study blockchain . There many announcements stating Japanese companies started demonstration experiments blockchain technology . We discussed new regulations FSA . `` Saito said unable disclose details discussions time , Bitcoin Magazine follow developments.Self-regulatory bodies JADA may provide insight governments around world looking approaches regulating Bitcoin blockchain technology . On recent episode 1776 Podcast , Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam 1776 co-founder Evan Burfield discussed concept regulatory hacking context Bitcoin . Regulatory hacking philosophy 1776 , business incubator based Washington , D.C , taken heart , basic premise find new ways change circumvent regulations slow progress certain industries . Ehrsam mentioned industries podcast : “ You select industries , sounds like guys 1776 focused , disrupted date whole lot , largely tend centralized and/or government regulated . Those include finance , healthcare education . There others , big three I would think about. ” Bitcoin ’ open , permissionless censorship-resistant nature makes potentially powerful tool regulatory hacking area finance.Bitcoin Turns Finance Into Software ProblemWhen asked overall perspective importance Bitcoin , Ehrsam talked blockchain turns finance nothing software problem . As opposed highly regulated slow-to-adapt traditional financial system , creating financial application top Bitcoin requires nothing ability write code . The Coinbase co-founder talked positive effects society found real-world problems become software problems : “ We ’ seen happens problem becomes software problem ; level innovation rate iteration occur goes roof . As result , get way great ideas built , consumer usually ends winning , , services better fees go down. ” In words , competition associated open , somewhat-lawless system creates better situations entrepreneurs consumers . As Ehrsam put , “ Said another way , [ software problems ] subject real market forces rather closed . It ’ open , like ’ seen Internet. ” The Frustrations Related Old , Closed Financial SystemsIn order describe benefits Bitcoin ’ openness , Burfield covered issues related traditional financial system . He noted : “ I ’ think people actually articulate frustrating interacting financial services day-to-day basis actually ‒ like , ’ many dumb things encounter again. ” Burfield explained problems associated traditional financial services companies obvious past due lack open system compared : “ We , sort , accept part background noise leading daily lives , flip start get innovators attacking problem without barriers closed system encounters , I ’ think even start show people things at. ” Burfield went contrast Bitcoin financial system Africa . While money transfer two parties different African nations routinely costs 10 percent transaction ’ value , central bankers sometimes resistant temptation print money , Bitcoin extremely low costs payment settlement network monetary policy essentially controlled users digital currency.Is Coinbase Involved Regulatory Hacking ? When asked Coinbase ’ approach regulatory hacking , Ehrsam quick note concept difficult apply financial services industry today , especially United States . He explained : “ I think ’ difficult people financial services , generally speaking , industries , like taxi industry example , would think regulatory hacking . The reality financial services highly regulated many , many different parties , whereas might one industries . Also , given recent past financial services , tends area extreme focus ‒ maybe point history United States. ” Ehrsam stated Coinbase ’ approach regulators rather friendly : “ Our approach , result , actually quite opposite ; ’ proactively go regulators early say , ‘ Hey . Here . We ’ good guys . You know us . If questions , please come us. ’ ” Coinbase taken lot flack Bitcoin community due compliance regulations , reality would shut rather quickly ’ follow law . Recently , Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong published Medium post pointed company exchange wallet provider . In past , ShapeShift CEO longtime Bitcoin entrepreneur Erik Voorhees defended Coinbase various attacks community.Bitcoin Won ’ Create Libertarian UtopiaAlthough Evan Burfield sees need regulatory hackers world , feel Bitcoin going create sort libertarian utopia . He explained : “ The idea Bitcoin going completely libertarian utopia ’ zero regulation complete anonymity probably real practical look stuff like this. ” Ehrsam mostly agreed Burfield ’ stance . He added : “ The reality maybe somewhere businesses operate Internet subject laws regulations , reality open environment , could argue libertarian ways . But net result , I agree , complete libertarian utopia . It ’ services brings fundamentally ’ existed before. ” There always perceived tension early adopters Bitcoin people want take technology general public . It ’ important remember , businesses built top Bitcoin blockchain regulated , base protocol much harder regulators get hands around.The aspects Bitcoin bring libertarian , even anarchistic , ideals real world usually found software rather startups . A company targeted shut , individuals free run open-source code , JoinMarket Dark Wallet , computers . Bitcoin far anonymous right , interesting see happens privacy-enhancing features added protocol.For workers , anything received payment goods services , including Bitcoin digital currencies , taxable income unless specifically exempted . If earn income Bitcoin exchange services another person , included gross income would subject income tax . These bitcoins could furthermore subject self-employment tax.In places , earn money trading bitcoins running exchange , could included gross income treated capital gains . This interpretation assumes bitcoins used store value like gold another commodity . If treated currency debt , gains could taxed based market value end tax year . Some common sense assumptions Bitcoin regulated made nature Bitcoin â€ ’ instance , tying value bitcoins local fiat currency . So one receives bitcoin , note made coin ’ USD value ( whatever currency ) cost basis tax reporting . The existing framework applies miners . Mined coins recorded income mining taxable , expenses deducted . Many miners sell bitcoins , miners taxed increase Bitcoin value time coins mined value sold . If loss , loss declared . In United States , IRS issued guidance Bitcoin digital currencies March 2014-21 Notice . The IRS clarified position digital currencies , views capital assets thus subject capital gains taxes . Trading spending taxable event capital gains must calculated USD . The IRS also stated mined bitcoins treated immediate income market value mined coins date mining. “ Most ’ know write losses , ” said Libra founder Jake Benson . “ The IRS allows offset income $ 3,000 per year capital losses . If losses ’ writing , ’ like throwing money away . Nobody likes taxes , owe less increase return , Bitcoin taxes often results benefit . In fact , majority users filing capital loss , means ’ actually saved money using tool. ” Benson also gives insight miners . “ Mining considered income , know price Bitcoin time mined , ” said . “ If make money Bitcoin trading , IRS requires report gains line level detail. ” The appropriate form 8949 , sub-form schedule D. Gains losses , outlined , treated like every capital asset . “ Bitcoin considered foreign currency IRS ’ legal tender ’ produced government , ” said . “ Though functions like currency , letter law clear. ” There numerous decisions government bodies regarding regulation Bitcoin . For instance , Commodity Futures Trade Commission ruled Bitcoin treated commodity . Commodities taxed 60/40 rules . Other capital assets , basic securities instance , taxed short long term rates . “ The IRS might need issue another notice clarifies method follow taxpayers may get confused , ” Benson noted . On global level , places better others comes taxation . Benson cites Australia one region . “ Like Europe , concept Value Added Tax ( VAT ) called GST , ” said . “ Without getting much detail , Australia 's tax authority decided GST applies sales Bitcoin . That decision basically prevented Bitcoin exchange operating Australia would forced apply 10 percent markup top market price . Europe also concept VAT , court recently ruled Bitcoin would subject VAT . This would huge impact Bitcoin businesses involved purchase sale Bitcoin. ” Benson notes , however , undergoing change . Few countries outlawed Bitcoin . In countries though , tax applied capital gains , results essentially tax obligations owners traders Bitcoin . Benson believes regulators investigating options comes regulation taxation Bitcoin . In UK , regulators determined VAT would apply Bitcoin sales . “ Probably closer one would assume , ” Benson noted . “ An IRS agent capable tracing tumbled coins blockchain evidence case regarding Carl Force DEA . He sentenced jail six-and-a-half months . It ’ quite common individuals Bitcoin industry villainize government , I ’ observed ’ also common individuals underestimate government prudence. ” There obstacles comes filing Bitcoin taxes , Benson admits , aggregation transactional data . “ Most people one exchange account wallets , ” said . “ In future , Benson believes Bitcoin treated similarly today . “ Realistically , way , ” said . “ For perspective , took IRS 15 years produce tax rules applied derivatives . If special guidance digital currency ever come , I would predict least decade . Furthermore , cost basis reporting rules fancy asset types finalized place 3 years ago . If anything , I would guess reporting requirements 10 years today. ” Comptroller Currency Thomas J. Curry , heads independent department charge supervising U.S. national banks , stated speech April 7 American Banker Retail Banking Conference “ ’ important regulators open changes underway technology business practices , ” according prepared remarks shared Bitcoin Magazine.The comptroller signalled shift attitudes toward fintech regulations , umbrella term used describe companies services use combination finance technology , Bitcoin prominent example . Announcing number new initiatives , “ innovator fairs ” aim bring banks nonbank innovators together OCC experts , sponsorship forum responsible innovation held Washington June 23 , Curry made clear “ [ T ] Office Comptroller Currency [ OCC ] want [ ] support efforts federal banks innovate. ” He added , “ But also want sure responsible way ’ threaten safety system financial well-being bank customers. ” In striking remarks comptroller stated : “ [ I ] ’ unreasonable characterize change underway financial marketplace revolutionary . But purists might point real revolutions sweep away existing institutions . That ’ happened , ” said , warned : “ without change , banks could go way businesses failed adapt changing times. ” In potentially historic closing remarks Curry stated : “ If revolution underway financial services ... retail banking frontlines . What I want know OCC ready support engage kind responsible innovation serves needs financial consumers makes financial system stronger ever. ” OCC hailed appropriate regulatory body oversee overhaul outdated financial regulations , old century , adapt changing needs 21st century , particular , foster welcoming environment fintech innovation.The remarks signal overall change attitude banks regulators toward fintech London declared financial capital world second year running , beating New York 8 points 1,000 primarily London ’ vibrant fintech sector . British regulators introduced fintech ’ “ progressive , forward-looking regulatory regime ” world , according city minister economic secretary U.K. Treasury Harriett Baldwin . She commenting recent announcement unprecedented partnership Barclays Circle . U.S. regulators noticed loudly asking shift way fintech companies regulated.The debate opened CFTC ’ Commissioner J. Christopher Giancarlo , hailed benefits blockchain called light-touch regulatory approach similar strategy employed early days Internet . He made remarks special address Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation 2016 Blockchain Symposium last week. “ [ A ] dramatic example potential benefits regulators blockchain technology collapse Lehman Brothers , ” Giancarlo said.Since , OCC issued white paper calling comments suggestions regulate “ responsible innovation. ” In opening remarks white paper , Curry stated : “ [ R ] apid dramatic advances financial technology beginning disrupt way traditional banks business . … At Office Comptroller Currency ( OCC ) , making certain institutions federal charters regulatory framework receptive responsible innovation along supervision supports it. ” Meanwhile , London races ahead . In speech Money 20/20 Europe , Hannah Nixon , managing director U.K. ’ Payment Systems Regulator , first-of-its-kind independent regulator , highlighted Britain ’ enthusiasm financial innovation stating : “ [ W ] e want encourage technological innovation . Not innovation ’ sake , drive improvements users , helping payment companies find new ever convenient ways people pay. “ In fact , want U.K. industry become center innovation , lead world development payment systems . And I believe PSR play major part that. “ We want people look U.K. payment systems PSR , say , ‘ We want like that. ’ ” They far succeeded ; consultancy firm Ernst & Young recently crowned London `` Fintech Capital World . '' Moreover , British banks earned reputation Bitcoin community notoriously granting bank accounts Bitcoin digital-currency-related businesses , seems changing . The shift attitude may , part , due PSR . Echoing criticisms often expressed Bitcoin community , Nixon stated : “ The evidence gathered showed wider financial crime regulations may causing people overcautious business third party. ” Although warns “ would need show teeth time time , ” states PSR “ ’ taking direct action ” PSR aware number banks “ planning start offering indirect access expand current services. ” One bank may Barclays , unprecedented move , partnered Circle. “ Historically , obtaining U.K. banking challenging U.K. Bitcoin companies ; however recent events show situation beginning change , ” Obi Nwosu , managing director Coinfloor , British-based Bitcoin exchange , stated email.The winds change , therefore , air . As $ 20 billion invested globally fintech , investment Bitcoin companies saw second best quarter ever first quarter 2016 , perhaps time repeat remarks George Osborn , Chancellor Exchequer , , speech 2014 declared : “ We stand dawn new era banking. ” Lawmakers regulators United States could much better job attracting innovative fintech startups country , Coin Center Executive Director Jerry Brito said recent cryptocurrency-focused event hosted Cato Institute.Although United States started leader Bitcoin regulation , falling behind jurisdictions , United Kingdom , innovation fintech digital currency embraced open arms.The U.S. Has Been Leader Bitcoin RegulationIn 2013 , U.S. Senate held first hearings Bitcoin . In year , FinCEN released first announcement government agency related technology . The IRS also first tax agency world clarify tax treatment Bitcoin digital currencies . Additionally , BitLicense New York first licensing regime world directed digital currencies. “ Although certainly imperfect , pronouncements brought clarity certainty emerging industry , approaches copied around world , ” Brito said Cato event.Other Countries Are Going FurtherBrito also noted United States ’ role regulatory leader Bitcoin around world guaranteed last . Other countries beginning start regulatory regimes ’ merely tolerate cryptocurrency firms , welcome open arms , said.Brito pointed United Kingdom specific example country looking foster growth digital currency space : “ The U.K. , example , created regulatory framework bends backward make easy quick innovative startups entrepreneurs comply appropriate consumer protection regulations safely enter market. ” Project innovate initiative Brito used bring home point U.K. ’ embracement fintech . This project offers dedicated teams startups make sure understand various regulations apply them.Once business regulated U.K. , ’ also able operate throughout rest European Union . Brito pointed Circle ’ recent partnership Barclays example sort regulatory structure creating environment connections startups traditional banking system.In past , U.K. Chancellor Exchequer George Osborne stated plan make London “ global center fintech . ... The race , determined win it. ” Current Status Regulation U.S.So U.S. comparison U.K. ? Brito said one BitLicense issued ( Circle ) , least 27 companies still waiting line approval . He also noted efforts offer regulatory clarity , digital currency legislation California , stalled . Brito added Coin Center currently working legislators half dozen states various proposals regulation digital currencies.Another key issue often brought regulation fintech firms United States different license required practically every state . “ Not time-consuming costly , states explained cryptocurrency businesses need comply , ” Brito said . “ At federal level , see tentative steps toward pro-innovation agenda. ” What Can U.S. Do Differently ? In addition pointing current issues digital currency regulation United States , Brito also offered possible solutions. “ Serious action federal banking regulators [ needed ] make clear banks ’ perfectly fine ‒ even encouraged ‒ establish relationships innovative fintech digital currency firms , ” said.Brito also pointed obvious need create new regulatory environment startups forced get license every state wish operate. “ Politically , options uphill battles , ’ think big , somebody else , ” said.The recent hacks ShapeShift , sort vending machine altcoins , one biggest stories Bitcoin past weeks . Although hacks serious hit exchange , CEO Erik Voorhees claims things could much worse startup decided comply BitLicense regulations New York.Traditional Regulations Won ’ WorkVoorhees recently panel related disruptive Bitcoin companies Consensus 2016 . OB1 CEO Brian Hoffman , Blockstack Labs co-founder Ryan Shea , Lightning CEO Elizabeth Stark also featured panel . The panel moderated Chamber Digital Commerce President Perianne Boring.The topic regulation came multiple occasions panel discussion , Voorhees , vocal critic various forms Bitcoin-related regulations , hold back sharing contempt various legal restrictions placed Bitcoin ( especially New York BitLicense ) .Voorhees made point traditional regulations ‒ applied Bitcoin blockchains ‒ like fitting “ square peg round hole. ” Voorhees said placing restrictions development new financial technology would akin requiring bloggers get sort publishing license early days Internet.Why BitLicense Would Have Made ShapeShift Hack WorseVoorhees also used multiple hacks thefts ’ recently deal make point traditional regulations applied Bitcoin . In regard hacks , Voorhees stated : “ You bet , example , followed New York Bitlicense taking personal , private information every single customer website , personal private information would hands hacker [ ] dark web. ” Voorhees extremely transparent everything happened relation hacks . He wrote full report events , talked Bitcoin.com podcast , answered questions Epicenter Bitcoin.The Blockchain Offers True Consumer ProtectionOne reasons Voorhees disdain BitLicense , view , makes consumers less safe . For example , ShapeShift collect practically information related customers crypto tokens work like digital cash.The fact ShapeShift collect information funds customers removes liability exchange ’ side increases security users . “ To , true consumer protection design , ’ one magic things blockchains allow , ” Voorhees added.New York jurisdiction entire world blocked ShapeShift . In particular case , appears ShapeShift made correct decision consumer protection perspective.In April Bitcoin community began preparing Australian Craig Wright ’ “ Satoshi Nakamoto reveal , ” another announcement Down Under overlooked . On April 14 , Standards Australia , non-government , not-for-profit standards organization announced “ Australia proposes International Blockchain Standards ” included proposal “ new field technical activity. ” This proposal registered International Organization Standardization ( ISO ) , world 's largest developer voluntary international standards , April 19 , The American National Standards Institute announced “ ANSI Seeks Comments New ISO Field Activity Blockchain Electronic Distributed Ledger Technologies. ” The United States access ISO standards development processes ANSI.Standards Australia also released explainer fact sheet called “ Blockchain & Electronic Distributed Ledger Technologies New Field Technical Activity. ” It ponders “ Why need blockchain standards ? ” postulates : “ [ ... ] Blockchain still emerging technology issues data sovereignty , privacy , lack consensus causing headaches policy makers , regulators industry alike . Notwithstanding , Australian stakeholders government want technology sustainable long-term . ISO members important role play making reality . ... The proposed international standards blockchain focus technical solutions promote interoperability , compatibility existing systems . This allow technology widely used deployed. ” Bitcoin Is StandardAs “ invisible ships ” lore ( myth ) goes : Native Americans could perceive fleet ships invade homeland armada alien collective experiences unable see aggressors . One could make similar comparison groups seeking standardize blockchains . Public blockchains Bitcoin Ethereum protocols standards . Institutions trying ( ) define blockchain name standardization trying co-opt technology may even realize staring standard . A blockchain ( ) layer standards paradox . This governance creates needless metalayer friction complexity . However , Bitcoin standard , decentralized nature means formal structure . That said , Bitcoin utilizes BIP Bitcoin Improvement Proposal de facto way introducing features ( via Github ) . In fact , BIP 123 , “ BIP Classification ” created Bitcoin Core Developer Eric Lombrozo explains : “ Bitcoin system involving number different standards . Some standards absolute requirements interoperability others considered optional , giving implementors choice whether support . In order BIP process closely reflects interoperability requirements , necessary categorize BIPs . … ” A Chip Off Old Blockchain ? Bitcoin stranger ISO standardization matter . Back 2014 , Jon Matonis , executive director Bitcoin Foundation , penned article CoinDesk “ Why Bitcoin Needs ISO-Certified Currency Code. ” The Bitcoin Foundation part founded standardization vision . According words time , “ [ The ] Bitcoin Foundation standardizes , protects promotes use Bitcoin cryptographic money benefit users worldwide. ” Bitcoin Magazine spoke Manu Sporny , chairman W3C Web Payments Community Group CEO Digital Bazaar . The W3C The World Wide Web Consortium international standards organization World Wide Web . When calling Bitcoin standard Sporny said : “ It depends talking ‘ de jure ’ standards ‘ de facto ’ standards . Bitcoin could argued ‘ de facto ’ standard , even argument bit weak since systems like Ethereum exist . When standard , 're looking true interoperability . That , multiple companies follow standard come systems interoperate . The Web good example set interoperable standards . Bitcoin n't hit point yet , much control core Bitcoin hands developers one major reference implementation . I think 's shaky call Bitcoin standard . It 's really interesting experiment. ” Meanwhile , Sporny notes W3C Blockchain standardization workshop , Blockchains Web : A W3C Workshop Distributed Ledgers Web scheduled June 29–30 MIT Media Lab . Down UnderThe Australian proposal mentions leveraging pre-existing standards ISO 20022 “ defines fields controls within messages transaction entities thus allowing interoperability. ” However , heels Reuters ' news story hackers compromised SWIFT software Bangladesh Bank . While Standards Australia notes , “ The work exclude legal obligations regulatory matters addressed government jurisdictions , ” also proposes “ Embed compliance money laundering Know Your Customer ( KYC ) requirements. ” StakeholdersThe proposal one many blockchain land grabs legacy actors trying stay relevant world Bitcoin governance . This proposal aims “ position ISO leading contributor develop global solutions facilitate data movement information flows thus enabling efficient timely transactions ” establishing blockchain standards.According Standards Australia consulting stakeholders proposal intends spearhead ISO work approved . For information make submission , contact Varant Meguerditchian ( varant.meguerditchian @ standards.org.au ) June 19.ANSI asks comments submitted Steve Cornish ( scornish @ ansi.org ) , ANSI senior director international policy , June 3 . Based feedback , ANSI ISO Council determine ANSI ’ position , comments submitted ISO July 14 voting deadline . The European Securities Markets Authority ( ESMA ) issued discussion paper titled “ The Distributed Ledger Technology Applied Securities Markets ” public consultation distributed ledger technology ( DLT ) . ESMA seeking feedback possible use DLT securities markets , including potential benefits risks.The Telegraph notes shares could eventually traded almost instantly without costly safety net clearing houses using blockchain , building blocks Bitcoin , although technology remains early stage . While DLT first deployed run Bitcoin network , could adopted streamline securities trading.ESMA began analyzing virtual currencies 2013 analyzed investments using virtual currencies DLT , including possible risks benefits , ESMA seeking in-depth feedback assessment . The public “ Consultation Distributed Ledger Technology Applied Securities Markets ” runs June 2 September 2 , 2016 . Stakeholders interested parties invited respond questions stated discussion paper describe alternatives ESMA consider . In particular , ESMA seeking feedback opinions fintech companies financial institutions interested use DLT securities markets banks , central counterparties , central securities depositaries , custodians , asset managers investors . Two key questions asked , seem especially representative indication ESMA ’ targets , , “ If working concrete application DLT securities markets please describe ( i.e. , activities , market segments , type assets expected benefits ) explain stand terms practical achievements relation objectives , ” “ Do see potential regulatory impediments deployment DLT securities markets ? ” ESMA use feedback provided participants consultation develop position use DLT securities markets , particular , assess whether regulatory response may needed.ESMA appreciates DLT may different applications impacts financial activities , market participants market infrastructures , depending variety elements , including capacity address number technical , governance , legal regulatory issues . A disclaimer notes ’ early form definitive official position DLT . With publication discussion paper , authority intend express firm position DLT , rather present “ factual objective manner ” results preliminary analysis possible impacts DLT securities markets.According authority ’ preliminary analysis , DLT could ultimately become trusted source record ownership securities safekeeping assets . It could speed clearing settlement certain financial transactions , reducing number intermediaries involved making reconciliation process efficient . Additional benefits could come possibility combining clearing settlement transactions single step , would almost instantaneous.DLT could also facilitate recording ownership variety securities safekeeping assets , implementation unique reference system across securities markets , collection , consolidation sharing data reporting , risk management supervisory purposes.In reference emerging trends DLT , ESMA notes smart contracts implemented top distributed ledgers could increase automation reduce uncertainty risk . In another interesting statement inspired emerging trend , pioneered , among others , Overstock , authority notes “ DLT could also used directly issue digital securities track ownership help supporting issuance related services. ” Two important arguments favor DLT security cost . The document notes perceived high security DLT ‒ according authority “ remains tested ” ‒ due distributed nature ledger , ’ present single point attack , use cryptography consensus secure validate transactions . “ These features could help mitigate risk cyber-attack , ” notes authority . “ They could also reduce need recovery plans , since records would kept several places time. ” A general reduction costs another suggested benefit DLT.Among perceived shortcomings existing DLT mentioned paper , scalability interoperability central role , risks thoroughly analyzed . It ’ worth noting authority clearly favors “ permissioned ” ledgers “ permissionless ” model used Bitcoin network , everyone ‒ including non-vetted anonymous participants ‒ operate network node validate transactions.The ESMA document notes capacity DLT fit existing regulatory framework may limit deployment , analyzes key E.U . regulations likely apply , requirement would impose participants DLT networks.China ’ government signaled warming digital currency new proposed civil law may recognize people ’ legal right virtual assets , including digital currencies.A new draft China ’ civil code introduced The National People ’ Congress June 27 . The draft reportedly designate virtual networks , data information property equal physical financial assets , bringing jurisdiction civil rights applicable property general.OKCoin founder CEO Star Xu told Bitcoin Magazine new draft law good news saying : '' The central bank defined Bitcoin `` virtual commodity '' 2013 ; however , digital assets different traditional properties sense due virtual features . That makes difficult incorporated traditional ‘ object ’ normally categorized ‘ chattel ’ ‘ real estate. ’ “ Since Chinese law clearly defined virtual asset past , property disputes involving ‘ virtual commodities ’ difficult resolved existing law . This proposed new civil law draft , includes digital assets legal rights , contribute protection property rights also establishing framework development future specific rules . “ It manifestation legal progress China benefit Bitcoin industry long term. ” The Chinese government taken wait-and-see stance , appreciating China fall behind rest world innovations Bitcoin blockchain technologies , conscious , , possible effect China ’ central currency , yuan . Huobi Chief Staff Yue Wen told Bitcoin Magazine : “ Without doubt , new draft Civil Code improvement Chinese law system , even though much difference enforcement . Based experience cooperative investigation , bitcoins recognized personal assets protect real cases . Policies help trace citizens ' bitcoins stolen. ” Yue Wen explained : “ Until , legal document Bitcoin Notice Preventing Risks Bitcoin , released five commissions ( People 's Bank China , Ministry Industry Information Technology People 's Republic China , China Banking Regulatory Commission , China Securities Regulatory Commission , China Insurance Regulatory Commission ) 2013 , Bitcoin defined visual commodity . Visual commodity object law China far , n't think big difference enforcement. ” He added : “ Also , new draft still discussion version , 're also paying attention progress hoping good news. ” In recent interview , BTCC CEO Bobby Lee acknowledged Chinese government signaling acceptance growth Bitcoin trading China time . He told Bitcoin Magazine central bank , PBOC , indicated open new innovations feel threatened digital currencies. “ I think great PBOC looking technology behind Bitcoin . I think central banks look technology , look adopting existing digital currencies like Bitcoin part basket reserve currencies. ” However , ChinaLedger , research development consortium Wanxiang Blockchain Labs China told CoinDesk language proposed law vague certain include digital currencies.Roland Sun ChinaLedger told CoinDesk although proposed definition could expanded include digital currencies , said `` long way go '' legal definition could enacted.Sun told CoinDesk : '' I ’ expect firm legislative recognition property rights cryptocurrency [ holders ] next five six years . `` Despite reservations , Chinese government , far , denied digital currencies would included new law.The Chinese constitution amended 2004 introduce civil laws governing individual ’ rights personal property , including lawful income , housing , savings , household items , books , reference materials , trees livestock . The top five blockchain crowdsales bore Bitcoin 2.0 movement raised quarter-of-a-billion dollars “ initial coin offerings , ” “ token sales ” like . Participants contend blockchain tokens going “ moon. ” Others argue , since ’ never registered , run afoul securities law.The second largest crowdsale best known , Ethereum $ 18,439,086 . Ethereum developers say blockchain distributed smart-contract platform “ fueled ” native digital currency similar Bitcoin . Ethereum ’ 2014 “ Ether sale ” preceded ’ May 2016 crowdsale DAO , so-called “ decentralized autonomous organization ” managed via Ethereum smart contracts.Ethereum DAO developers currently face scrutiny wake $ 55 million compromise DAO attacker . They deciding whether intervene undo damage done draining funds . DAO token holders , purchased tokens Ether , vote “ important decisions relating management DAO , ” project claims . The DAO raised Ethereum worth $ 200 million time attack . The top five blockchain crowdsales : DAO , Ethereum , WAVES , Lisk , Digix Augur , raised approximately $ 200 million . Nearly $ 170 million Ethereum DAO . Lisk , cryptocurrency decentralized application platform , raised $ 5,880,089 “ initial coin offering ” 2016 . Lisk founders worked code three weeks going public . “ In following three weeks built enough momentum start crowdfunding , ” Lisk co-founder , Max Kordek , told . The crowdfunding went one month Lisk brought 14,000 bitcoins . Kordek emphasizes importance marketing calls Lisk ’ “ intensive marketing campaign ” “ huge success. ” Securities LawDevelopers say providing access software , securities . The literature littered finance security terms . Securities laws broadly interpreted designed adaptable innovative ways people raise funds . Congress developed federal securities law stock market crash 1929 . The speculative frenzy ending October 1929 panic , called “ Black Thursday , ” led Congress enact Securities Act 1933 ( “ Securities Act ” ) Securities Exchange Act 1945 ( “ Exchange Act ” ) . State blue sky laws , Securities Exchange Commission rules regulations , well regulations National Association Securities Dealers ( NASD ) combine create securities law . SEC v. W.J . Howey Co. ( 1946 ) set precedent investment contract entails giving money others manage control funds expectation profit.Blockchain crowdsales market token holders “ community ” participants , enjoy management control blockchain software . Indicating , , help build blockchain platform time . DAO participants , instance , use Ether toward DAO projects support . Lisk says participants earn Lisk bug bounties . If blockchain crowdsale participants enjoy management control , ’ arguably investment contract security . Still , developers generally lack management control enterprise real world.Who would shareholders petition obtain redress something goes awry ? Core developers Ethereum , etc . argue “ smart contracts , ” , distributed software , handles everything.Jason Seibert , lawyer serves Bitcoin securities cases , described typical blockchain crowdsale : “ Hey , give us money going develop something . We quite sure yet , ’ able use stuff , even though ’ know yet. ” Even blockchain crowdsales , fact , crowdsales securities offerings , must still registered JOBS Act regulation . Illustrating nuance securities laws , Seibert evokes baseball cards : “ Nobody thinks baseball card manufacturers print baseball cards intent investment , ” Oregon-based lawyer , represented Trendon Shavers first Bitcoin criminal fraud case U.S. , said . “ Come , ’ sold pack gum ! But everyone knows people collect trade make money them. ” Blockchain crowdsales come across much differently . They ’ bubble gum pictures athletes . “ We ’ talking investment opportunity , ” Seibert says . Heretofore , blockchain crowdsales enjoyed unwritten “ good deal exception , ” wherein , since everybody happy , nobody files lawsuits tips relevant officials . That DAO smart contract platform drained $ 55 million core Ethereum developers considering implementing fork roll back perceived heist , remains seen “ good deal exception ” soon expire . An SEC official commented June 20 $ 55 million attack Ethereum underscores concerns blockchain systems.Thanks DAOs code , Ethereum developers could intervene undo $ 55 million drain . But might used court proof held control Ethereum DAO . The DAO would truly “ decentralized autonomous organism , ” advertised , participants could seen misled investors . “ You ’ generally hear investor say , ‘ Had I know this-or-that , perhaps I would invested , ” Seibert explained . The European Commission published new directive draft last week proposing extend strict anti-money laundering ( AML ) regulation virtual currency exchange services custodial wallet providers . Intended counter “ money launderers , tax evaders , terrorists , fraudsters criminals , ” directive could mean many Bitcoin companies E.U . apply know customer ( KYC ) types checks users.The proposal , particularly focuses terrorist financing , intends restrict anonymous use virtual currencies , presumably referring bitcoin altcoins.According draft published executive arm European Union : “ Transactions virtual currencies benefit higher degree anonymity classical financial fund transfers therefore entail risk virtual currency may used terrorist organizations conceal financial transfers . Possible risks relate irreversibility transactions , means dealing fraudulent operations , opaque technologically complex nature industry , lack regulatory safeguards. ” As , European Commission recommends existing anti-money laundering regulation apply virtual currency services , , particular , exchanges custodial wallet providers.The European Commission writes : “ [ T ] prevent misuse virtual currencies money laundering terrorist financing purposes , Commission proposes bring virtual currency exchange platforms custodian wallet providers scope Anti-Money Laundering Directive . These entities apply customer due diligence controls exchanging virtual real currencies , ending anonymity associated exchanges. ” If adopted , Bitcoin companies required collect customers ’ identity documents ; something several already , though currently mandatory . ( In cases financial partners ‒ banks ‒ require Bitcoin companies apply KYC order get account . ) Additionally , Bitcoin companies need monitor transactions platforms report suspicious activity.InterpretationThe proposal go detail explaining kinds services affected . It 's clear directive would apply Bitcoin exchanges wallet services control customer funds . Whether also includes exchanges wallet providers hold onto private keys , private keys case multisig-addresses , clear . ( EDCAB ’ Siân Jones thinks might ; Coin Center 's Jerry Brito thinks . ) The European Commission , says directive drafted accordance “ relevant virtual currencies market players , ” including “ exchange platforms , wallet providers [ ] representative group virtual currency stakeholders , ” maintains regulation hamper virtual currency adoption – perhaps might even it.The draft proposal reads : “ The proposed measure negative effects benefits technological advances presented distributed ledger technology underlying virtual currencies . [ … ] The credibility virtual currencies rise used criminal purposes . In context , anonymity become hindrance asset virtual currencies taking potential benefits spread. ” Individual UsersFor , directive targets exchanges wallet providers – individual Bitcoin users . Toward end document , however , European Commission acknowledges regulating exchanges wallet providers may ultimately suffice prevent nefarious use virtual currencies . After , Bitcoin users run wallet software computer smartphone , thereby requiring wallet provider all.The draft therefore suggests addresses may tied individual users point future well : “ The inclusion virtual exchange platforms custodian wallet providers entirely address issue anonymity attached virtual currency transactions , large part virtual currency environment remain anonymous users also transact without exchange platforms custodian wallet providers . To combat risks related anonymity , national Financial Intelligence Units ( FIUs ) able associate virtual currency addresses identity owner virtual currencies . In addition , possibility allow users self-declare designated authorities voluntary basis assessed. ” The proposal must still approved European Parliament member states , could enforced soon January 1 , 2017 . Once approved , EU member states expected implement national laws based directive . The proposal still draft-stage , however , meaning still room alterations based input individual member states.The European Commission published draft directive last week proposing amend existing anti-money laundering rules include virtual currencies bitcoin . If adopted , exchanges well custodial wallet providers need collect customers ’ identity documents report suspicious activity platform relevant authorities.In attempt avoid regulatory overreach , group Dutch Bitcoin startups experts reaching Dutch Ministry FInance offering expertise , hoping potentially adjust proposed directive amendment.Uncertainty still exists extent proposed directive ; particular considered “ wallet providers offering custodial services credentials necessary access virtual currencies. ” Some legal experts maintain amendment would concern companies fully control customer funds ( Circle Xapo ) . Other legal experts think may also apply wallet providers merely hold onto single key multisig-address ( BlockTrail GreenAddress ) ; interpretation confirmed German Bitcoin-news site bitcoinblog.de , reportedly spoke E.U.-representative.Additionally , Bitcoin-services really designed wallets hold private keys ( ChangeTip SatoshiPay ) , may fall new regulation well.Jouke Hofman CEO Bitcoin-brokerage Bitonic exchange BL3P initiated outreach Dutch Ministry Finance well Dutch Bitcoin-startups experts.Speaking Bitcoin Magazine , Hofman explained : “ Under current provision , 's clear regulation applies , exactly . It covers wallet providers hold onto private keys users . But also include wallet providers hold onto one key two-of-three multisig address ? What bitcoins time-locked wallet providers spend funds , perhaps future ? And regulation applies key holder , definition wallet provider begin ? Could regulation perhaps even apply Lightning Network nodes ? It 's important types nuances taken account drafting new regulation upcoming technology 's still much development. ” This sentiment shared Corné Plooy , main developer behind Amiko Pay , payment channel network sharing similarities Lightning Network . As part initiative , Plooy reaching Dutch Ministry Finance hopes giving better understanding technological potential Bitcoin protocol – possible consequences regulatory overreach.Explaining perspective Bitcoin Magazine , Plooy said : “ A major difference financial technology information technology like software websites financial technology usually deployed without approval existing parties like banks . I believe stops financial sector level innovation IT-sectors . This Bitcoin makes huge difference . It allows peer-to-peer economy , without dependence large organizations . There longer strong separation role consumer service provider . Anyone good idea bit expertise make idea reality , giving huge boost fintech innovation. ” He continued : “ Regulation may destroy advantage . What would become Google perform suspicious activities check every website linked ? What happen Lightning Network every user comply AML/KYC regulations ? That real concern multisig key holders considered wallet providers newly proposed E.U . regulations . Privacy concerns aside , individuals n't resources apply sorts checks. ” If directive adopted without sufficient provisions startups room innovation , Hofman Plooy , accompanied representatives BlockTrail Bitmymoney , worry stifle Bitcoin innovation – drive innovation European Union . They maintain regulation targeted wallet providers withheld , prefer so-called “ wait see ” approach domain. “ The core issue regulation take account advantages demands future inventions , n't know future inventions , ” Plooy explained . “ We need space new ideas deployed , grow freedom , prove use world . If E.U . n't provide space , innovation happen elsewhere , Europe always stay behind. ” On top , initiative questions whether proposed regulation accomplish stated goals first place . In directive draft , European Commission argues needs impose KYC-checks gatekeepers virtual currencies order prevent criminal abuse . But since Bitcoin peer-to-peer protocol design , 's unclear regulating specific types wallet services effect regard , argue. “ We concede on- off-ramps – exchanges brokerages Bitcoin traded fiat currency back – considered gatekeepers system . We also understand may need regulated extent , ” Hofman explained . “ But directive proposes apply full KYC/AML-checks certain wallet providers . We n't believe companies work gatekeepers , since anyone trivially send , receive store Bitcoin without companies anyway . They 're service providers , sure – gatekeepers. ” As initiative limits reaching Dutch policymakers , Hofman hopes Bitcoin industry players E.U . member states undertake similar steps . He reaching several past week , suggesting may want take action well. “ In end , I think mostly lack understanding underlying principles Bitcoin – particular pay-scripts – European Commission come phrasing , ” Hofman said . “ But since draft , still ways alter content . All E.U . member states input paper , European companies believe directive needs adjusted contact relevant government officials perhaps offer knowledge . I n't know sure actually help , least need try. ” The European Parliament European Council must approve directive adopted . If adjustments made draft proposal , need happen short notice regulatory standards : The proposal scheduled enforced 2017 , council discuss draft early next week . Once adopted , E.U . member states expected implement national laws based directive.Canada ’ central bank , Bank Canada , five Canadian banks ( like growing number banks around world ) experimenting blockchain technology possible digital dollar growing demand digital fintech payment systems puts squeeze traditional banking sector.At recent IMF/World Bank conference hosted U.S. Federal Reserve , estimated 90 central banks , including Bank Canada , came forward talk research experiments distributed ledger technology ( DLT ) , blockchain digital currencies.The big Canadian banks also members R3 Consortium , working 50 member banks worldwide , developing foolproof methodology standard blockchain technologies banks . The Bank Canada cautious commenting digital money experiments adamant experiment nothing more.Martin Bégin , representative speaking Bank Canada , told Bitcoin Magazine : “ What referred CAD-coin means representing settlement balances distributed ledger , like deposit receipt . It could also called ‘ deposit-coin ’ ‘ settlement-coin. ’ It ’ exist medium exchange outside experimental wholesale payment system . Our goal stage understand mechanics , limits possibilities technology. ” Bégin said Bank Canada chose experiment Ethereum members familiar experienced coding platform. “ This particular project one part larger Bank Canada work plan investigate distributed ledger technology better understand characteristics , ” said . “ We may look platforms going forward. ” According Bégin , greater potential DTL lies beyond Bitcoin blockchain , applications outside digital currencies. “ Fintech important part Bank ’ research agenda , coincidence , ” said . “ There many benefits fintech , realizing , guarding risks could create , require strong collaboration among policymakers , incumbent financial institutions new entrants . For Bank Canada , one best ways really understand technology build experiment , conjunction industry . It ’ job forward-looking. ” Fintech Experts : Regulatory Uncertainty Stifling Fintech Development CanadaMeanwhile Canadian Money Service Business Association ( CMSBA ) , representing 800 MSBs , petitioning federal government ’ Financial Transactions Reports Analysis Centre Canada ( FINTRAC ) , agency responsible regulating fintech , clearly define money services businesses include digital currencies businesses.Amber D. Scott , CEO Outlier Solutions , told Bitcoin Magazine : “ There Canadian banks deal Bitcoin companies , instances companies registered MSBs Financial Transactions Reports Analysis Centre Canada ( FINTRAC ) . ” The CMSBA sent letter Canada ’ Office Superintendent Financial Institutions ( OSFI ) recently , saying members bank accounts closed “ appears sector-wide sweep even though compliant anti-money laundering rules. ” In regulatory Catch-22 , part “ de-risking strategy , ” banks need FINTRAC define digital fintech startups money services businesses offer business account. “ Regulators FINTRAC Office Superintendent Financial Institutions ( OSFI ) known relatively negative views MSBs ( whether organization-wide bias examiners I say ) , ” said Scott , “ makes wonder MSB designation harm good comes ability Bitcoin companies access traditional financial system. “ Even regulatory regime nets favorably ( I hope ) , access banking may force companies choose jurisdictions . This truly unfortunate Canada potential become hub fintech innovation — rapidly depleting advantages had. ” The Financial Post reports recently unidentified bank fined $ 1.1 million FINTRAC providing accounts money service businesses apparent crackdown making harder fintech companies get bank accounts.FINTRAC , hand , stalling defining Bitcoin digital currencies businesses “ Money Services Businesses ” leaving fintech startups Catch-22 banks regulators.In interview Bitcoin Magazine , Kyle Kemper , Executive Director Bitcoin Alliance Canada , noted need Canadian Bitcoin community advocate progress . “ At point lobby crypto pales comparison banking payments lobby . A course inaction could lead greater movement away fiat general crypto solution providers ' solutions become robust , frictionless , adopted. ” Coinbase Bumps Up Against Canada ’ Regulatory UncertaintyCoinbase , one world ’ successful Bitcoin companies , recently notified Canadian customers withdrawing Canadian market could longer support transactions Canadian dollars.At time , company setting Japan recently expanded Australia , making 33rd country served Coinbase.Fred Ehrsam , president co-founder Coinbase , said recent Reddit AMA : “ Our mission create open financial system world part making digital currency easy access , many countries possible . So makes sad 've interruption [ Canada ] . The goal get back online good payment service provider bank Canada . A bunch proactively reached news went , hopefully get good replacement soon. ” “ The fact [ Coinbase ] struggle one primary pillars exchange , able process fiat withdrawals deposits , shows Canada difficult environment Bitcoin Fintech companies operate , ” said Kemper.Bank Canada Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins noted recently calls “ traditional trusted intermediaries ” may replaced convenient technologies ; however , ’ believe Canada ’ regulatory body lagging behind. “ Fintech regulators also face difficult challenge balancing need ensure safety soundness financial markets need encourage innovation , ” said. “ The regulatory framework needs adapt door opened unmanaged financial operational risks , unchecked critical dependencies within financial system moral hazard . Promoting financial stability core function Bank Canada , take system-wide perspective monitor risks. ” According Scott , however , system set way many companies difficult time playing rules , time. “ In many ways , banks acting gatekeepers de facto regulators , truly unfortunate . We 've spoken CEO company asked bank committed investing $ 1 million bank would open business account answer ‘ no. ’ It 's completely baffling bank would willing invest money business provide operating account business. ” Scott noted MSBs fintech companies sometimes afraid go record n't want lose existing bank accounts , including accounts may opened covertly guise software companies numbered companies. “ Banks credit unions afraid open accounts keep open , since face pressure FINTRAC OSFI treat accounts high risk ( regulatory requirement ) close , ” said Scott. “ These tactics directly driving risky behavior , ” added . “ Ultimately , ones winning game criminals , legitimate businesses forced act evasively , turn , makes illicit activity difficult identify. ” The divided regulatory policies frameworks digital currencies , including Bitcoin , United States created impractical ecosystem startups operate in.The country ’ state-by-state regulations money transmission licensing led unclear regulatory framework digital currencies , states , including North Carolina , New Jersey California , establishing regulations favor digital currency startups businesses , others , New York Connecticut , require startups obtain expensive licenses operate legal entities.This rules-based approach government agencies made virtually impossible digital currency startups compliant state ’ regulations , resulting termination services states.In response Office Comptroller Currency ’ request comment , Coin Center , Washington-based , non-profit cryptocurrency research center asked development federal charter would create unified lightweight , limited purpose regulatory framework fintech digital currencies United States. “ How [ ] facilitate responsible innovation institutions sizes ? ” OCC asked white paper.Coin Center suggests simple answer approach core issue innovation enable fintech virtual currency startups obtain passport offer cross-state services throughout nation , without dealing state-independent regulations money transmission.The elimination barriers states additionally open fintech startups numerous payment financial systems use obtain banking services . Reflecting concept open network introduced OCC white paper , logical offer open regulatory environment fintech startups focused bringing innovative disruptive financial services country.The OCC , independent bureau within Treasury Department , holds ability regulate supervise national banks federal branches foreign banks United States . Thus , OCC one government organizations possesses authority independent states regulations money transmission.If OCC committed innovation development open network technology says white paper , maximize resources lead state creating viable ecosystem fintech companies operate , similar regulatory environment United Kingdom.The U.K. regulatory bodies persistently opted favorable policies fintech digital currency startups since early 2015 , realizing market importance fintech economy nation.Its government took alternative approach , establishing different regulations businesses fintech industry order enable fintech sector operate prosper. “ Our interviews suggested U.K. government consider additional actions support Fintech community , particularly areas improving access talent ; encouraging closer collaboration information sharing established financial services businesses Emergent Fintech ; actively championing sector , ” states official report commissioned U.K. Trade Investment.Apart local regulatory policies , U.K. government agencies including Financial Conduct Authority ( FCA ) went far securing partnerships global organizations South Korea , Singapore Hong Kong improve fintech market position leading nation financial technologies.Singapore South Korea , instance , partnered U.K. Financial Conduct Authority create bridge Singaporean South Korean fintech startups British . The partnership established friendly ecosystem fintech startups discuss emerging technologies latest trends market . With program , favorable regulations federal government , Singapore South Korea quickly escalated leaders Asian fintech blockchain industries.Furthermore , European countries Switzerland Germany also begun develop friendly regulations fintech startups , recognizing significant impact economies . As result , German fintech companies received venture capital funding startups London United States , securing $ 1.6 billion investment.The Swiss Federal Tax Administration ’ announcement mid-2015 eliminating value-added tax ( VAT ) Bitcoin spurred interest among investors venture capital firms , enabling fintech startups secure large sums funding local investors.Considering potential fintech rapid growth American global markets , United States OCC follow lead countries U.K. encourage government establish regulatory policies ’ leave fintech industry lagging behind global competitors.Last month , European Commission published draft directive proposing extend anti-money laundering ( AML ) regulation virtual currency exchange services custodial wallet providers . The draft suggests many Bitcoin companies operating within European Union need apply know-your-customer ( KYC ) types checks users , enforced 2017.Phrasing directive left uncertainty extent , however —in particular considered “ wallet providers offering custodial services credentials necessary access virtual currencies. ” For clarification , Bitcoin Magazine reached E.U . representatives.IntentSpeaking Bitcoin Magazine , E.U . representatives ( preferred mentioned name quoted directly ) explained concept motive proposal straightforward.From perspective European Commission , virtual currencies present problem allow money circulate easily , 's difficult know 's transacting . To address , E.U . wants set checkpoints : Custodian wallet providers exchange services would required monitor transactions platform report suspicious activity.Within context , representatives acknowledged proposed regulation apply services happen hold onto customer private keys . There , instance , intention regulate Lightning Network nodes mining pool operators.Custodial wallet providers , provision , wallet providers hold onto least one private key customers . Naturally , includes wallet providers hold full control users ' private keys , Circle Xapo . But also includes services hold onto single key multi-signature setup , even ca n't spend behalf customers , GreenAddress Blocktrail . Wallet providers hold private keys — like Mycelium Blockchain — would fall provision.The E.U . representatives also indicated might discussion potential minimum threshold . Under current proposal , custodial wallet provider , well exchange service , would required apply AML/KYC checks customers — even trivial amounts . The representatives indicated may reconsidered perhaps introduce minimum threshold identity verification would required . ( But guaranteed . ) AnonymityAnother part draft directive garnered attention paragraph pertaining future research . Specifically , European Commission suggests users Bitcoin addresses may able linked prevent nefarious use digital currency.The draft directive reads : “ The inclusion virtual exchange platforms custodian wallet providers entirely address issue anonymity attached virtual currency transactions , large part virtual currency environment remain anonymous users also transact without exchange platforms custodian wallet providers . To combat risks related anonymity , national Financial Intelligence Units ( FIUs ) able associate virtual currency addresses identity owner virtual currencies . In addition , possibility allow users self-declare designated authorities voluntary basis assessed. ” Speaking Bitcoin Magazine , E.U . representatives acknowledged ideas assessed — time soon . Specifically , report scheduled 2019 explore options potentially make recommendations.Moreover , specified draft , intent point merely allow users voluntary choice self-declare addresses . The E.U . representatives confirmed yet plans make non-declaration illegal . The representatives suggested users may choose self-declare addresses , however , order increase credibility use virtual currencies , anonymous nature seen threat.The legislative proposal currently preliminary discussion phase ; may still modifications European Parliament European Council levels . At least one initiative , coming Netherlands , started adjust proposal , importantly removing KYC/AML requirements wallet providers.The European Banking Authority ( EBA ) advised European Commission establish regulatory regime specific virtual currencies bitcoin . Commenting commission ’ proposal amend existing European anti-money laundering directive , EBA expresses opinion , long term , oversight digital currencies fall regular anti-money laundering provisions , rather specialized EU body.In response commission published EBA August 2016 , banking authority suggests existing anti-money laundering directive “ currently suitable mitigating risks arising [ virtual currency ] transactions . Instead , separate regulatory regime , far-reaching amendments [ ... ] would required. ” Impact Bitcoin Addresses MinersIn July 2016 , European Commission published draft directive , proposing extend strict anti-money laundering ( AML ) regulations “ countering financing terrorism ” ( CFT ) measures Bitcoin service providers . Specifically , directive would apply virtual currency exchange services custodial wallet providers.The draft directive also hinted regulation may required future perhaps include Bitcoin address-ownership . The EBA ’ response indicates agreement assessment suggests mining subject oversight well , stating : “ [ Virtual currencies ] incur additional , technology-specific risks make distinct conventional fiat currencies scope [ existing anti-money laundering directive ] . So-called ‘ 51 percent attacks , ’ example , one risk , [ constituting ] scenario pool miners attains 51 percent computational power units particular [ virtual currency ] scheme mined , turn allows pool block transactions. ” The banking authority therefore says amendment current anti-money laundering directive may suffice longer term . It argues favor installment special regulatory body virtual currencies future.EU DirectiveEven though EBA advises commission establish regulatory regime specific virtual currencies , generally support proposed amendment existing anti-money laundering directive . As establishment new regulatory regime would take significant amount time , amendment proposal serves good intermediary step. “ Such regulatory regime [ … ] would require several years develop , consult , finalise transpose , therefore option , given short time frame within Commission asked develop proposals , ” writes EBA . “ It may therefore advisable Commission co-legislators initiate soon possible comprehensive analysis needed assessing , , regulatory regime would suitable [ virtual currency ] transactions. ” The EBA , however , suggest draft directive requires refinement . In particular , banking authority points European authorities well digital currency companies operating Europe well-prepared deal new legislation . This might require additional time new directive applied.According EBA : “ [ I ] n order amendments reduce risk virtual currencies abused money laundering terrorist financing purposes , Commission co-legislators ensure competent authorities appropriate tools disposal ensure effective supervision [ custodial wallet providers ’ ] [ virtual currency exchange platforms ’ ] compliance AML/CFT obligations. ” The new directive scheduled enforced January 1 , 2017 , EBA believes June 26 , 2017 , would realistic goal.Sharing DataThe EBA also concerned international qualities virtual currencies bitcoin.An EU directive law , rather serves guideline individual member states draft national laws . This means resulting laws one member state may differ slightly others.And since digital currencies live internet , service providers — like digital currency exchanges custodial wallet providers — provide services internet well , state laws easily circumvented , EBA warns.The EBA therefore recommends different European member states need work closely together , noting risks tackled within political union relevant agencies different countries cooperate.According EBA : “ It [ ... ] essential competent authorities different member states able liaise exchange information relation operation [ virtual currency exchange platforms ] [ custodial wallet providers ] territory . [ … ] The EBA therefore considers EU Commission co-legislators therefore introduce amendments [ ... ] ensure competent authorities responsible AML/CFT supervision [ ... ] gateways place exchange relevant information one another. ” Compliance efforts tall task many financial services organizations worldwide . New regulatory requirements leading greater demands collect relevant client information establishing business relationship.KYC ( Know Your Customer ) , AML ( Anti-Money Laundering ) , CTF ( Counter-Terrorism Financing ) labor intensive activities chilling effect business productivity exact huge cost . This result voluminous amounts customer data needing manually checked accuracy , completeness , duplications ensure targeted requirements met.Customer losses leading decline revenue result data gathering , onboarding , client-lifecycle activities inefficiently handled . An example financial services industry customer may drop banking relationship due lengthy credit decision process rapid competitor response . Moreover , slow manual processes become prime targets increased regulatory scrutiny inspections , resulting fines even jail time business leaders.The need advanced automation real-time customer setup solutions never greater . One solutions advanced cost-effective , automated blockchain solutions meeting regulatory demands tied KYC , AML , CTF . An emerging startup player space Ireland-based firm , Kyckr.Taming Compliance JungleKyckr blockchain-centric solutions provider delivers end-to-end compliance data sourced 150 business registers worldwide . Information captured disseminated use Kyckr ’ verification API used banks , financial institutions , payment solutions providers , accounting law firms organizations meet regulatory requirements , goal preventing criminal activities money laundering , terrorism , fraud.Kyckr ’ beginning evolution interesting one . Rob Leslie , company founder brainchild , spent early career living Japan working electronics engineer . After nearly 20 years , returned Ireland introduced Ben Cronin , eventual Kyckr co-founder.During coffee shop meeting early 2007 , Cronin mentioned opportunity commercialization compliance data via European Business Registers . Leslie thought looked like interesting idea , started new initiative March 2007 , regulation starting drive changes . Their first sale December 2008 , data delivered 12 European registers . They deliver data 155 registers around world via web portal API.Recently Kyckr announced new , collaborative effort corporate identity blockchain service Credits , platform provides distributed ledger technology software cloud-based services . This move signals Kyckr ’ commercial readiness deliver automated alternative prevailing model capturing employing compliance information . The goal partnership become best-in-class service verified , secure trusted corporate identity — single source truth.Speaking Bitcoin Magazine , Leslie described current AML KYC environments complex hard . “ As Kyckr grows , seeing apply automation solving lots tasks currently manual . This allows banks organizations put staff work complex cases , instead vast majority organizations , straightforward process. ” He says Kyckr always held view KYC properly , information must gathered authoritative source , business register . “ Nothing else ever accepted , provenance veracity data guaranteed. ” Over course evolution , Kyckr also discovered identity information , whether personal corporate , naturally exist aggregated databases . Rather stored disparate places , requiring API connections build complete identity profiles primary sources.Kyckr ’ just-in-time element likely viewed prized value proposition . Says Leslie : “ We believe real-time monitoring needed allow compliance maintained real-time . Also , think governments need , duty provide means identity verified , efficiently quickly . To date , done well . Kyckr aiming making organizational access data easier order make compliance process efficient , faster better everyone. ” Leslie believes Kyckr ’ corporate identity blockchain get lot attention increasing awareness identity information serving root everything . “ This verification process must digital , secure , trusted fast . We looking support rapid growth happening space comes delivering digital trust ensuring availability solid trust anchor. ” The effective management regulatory requirements vital continued advancement digital currency industry . Dash , privacy-centric , open-source , digital money ecosystem , therefore chosen integrate AML/KYC solutions designed manage concerns , cooperation blockchain compliance provider Coinfirm.Some hailing move key milestone addressing vulnerabilities tied fraud money laundering . Others skeptical , viewing potentially undermining Dash ’ core tenets around privacy . Dash , viewed proponents enhanced version Bitcoin , garnered great deal media attention late decentralized platform allows digital cash spent online merchants service providers worldwide . Its features include instant transfers , low fees , high levels privacy security.As seventh valued digital currency , $ 82 million market cap , Dash ’ self-funded , independently-governed community comprised 15,000 users facilitate million dollars transactions every 24 hours . These transactions verified users global network 4000 master nodes.Dash ’ new collaborator , London-based Coinfirm , risk compliance platform offering compliance services blockchain-based transactions . The platform employs proprietary algorithms address AML/CFT , credit risk assessment , regulatory requirements pertaining digital currencies . This gives institutions ability properly evaluate clients speed agility , ultimately allowing greater access new pools clientele.The Present LandscapeIn case digital currencies like Dash , integrating new product service delivery models challenge . With regulation requirements varying across wide global geography , compliance often becomes painstaking , complex costly undertaking.Coinfirm ’ role navigate linkages manner allows Dash work first time commercial financial institutions already subject compliance requirements . Besides streamlining onboarding process new corporate clients , Coinfirm platform manage ongoing AML monitoring synchronizing Dash ’ blockchain network . Counterparty verification , risk assessments fraud management among many deliverables Coinfirm provide behalf Dash.In addition , Coinfirm offer reports allow Dash ’ entrepreneur user base ability create verifiable Dash credit history rating . As result , community control faster track launching new product service offerings directed toward strategic customer niche.According Coinfirm Co-founder CEO Pawel Kuskowski , firm ’ partnership Dash represents major development aligning digital currency space larger world commerce . “ We believe creating first compliant digital currency ecosystem holds great significance , achieve broad acceptance regulators , financial institutions , entities individuals , ” Kuskowski said Bitcoin Magazine. “ This collaboration result immense benefits see , two firms , entire blockchain , cryptocurrency financial system whole . This set standard , benchmark precedent future , demonstrating digital currencies privacy properly coexist , strike balance prevailing requirements financial world. ” Kuskowski believes regulatory compliance one key hurdles overcome commercial mass adoption digital currencies happen . “ We 've seen media coverage portrayed aspects digital currencies years , commercial financial world approached . AML compliance one main reasons two worlds n't gelled yet , large roadblock entities already operating space . Our joint effort Dash major move addressing this. ” New Possibilities DashSpeaking Bitcoin Magazine , Ryan Taylor , Director Finance Dash , says new collaborative effort Coinfirm open potential opportunities “ expand products services ’ able provide integrate past . We ’ super excited ’ definitely game changer terms moving forward. ” Taylor notes nothing fundamentally change Dash ’ core protocol , product privacy elements result partnership . What move addresses , says , efforts build mass adoption addition new products services various business partnerships.Says Taylor : “ I think lot early , negative reaction outside community — perception Dash somehow regulated . That ’ case , however . We simply seeking greatly expand number businesses integrate Dash , already meet AML KYC compliance requirements. “ Personally , I ’ already spent quite bit time public Slack channel yesterday answering questions addressing I see knee-jerk reactions . A lot users reacted negatively media headlines without understanding limits full implications ’ . I listened 95 percent users questions answered , much comfortable direction ’ headed. ” Taylor says user affected start interacting regulated businesses Dash partnered . He offers clarifying example : “ So I receive bitcoin someone else exchange funds Dash , I , user , would unaffected . But I wanted buy sell Dash directly site like Coinbase , I would go Coinbase ’ compliance requirements .

How tax reporting agencies responding large number digital currencies exist worldwide ? To extent virtual money used tax avoidance purposes ? All sparked fervent conversations among paid bitcoin , simply investing , many anarcho-capitalist bent view taxation theft . And given prevailing issues around tax havens , offshore accounts , encryption Panama Paper revelations , many would argue prevailing tax monitoring systems prime disruption.In interview Bitcoin Magazine , tax professional Daniel Winters , addressed ways make sense increasingly complex U.S. taxation landscape . His boutique firm Global Tax Accountants one handful worldwide focuses tax ramifications digital currency blockchain transactions.Winter ’ journey narrowly defined niche interesting one . Hearing bitcoin ’ growing popularity 2013 , ponied money purchased tiny amount . He became fascinated Bitcoin ’ trustless , peer-to-peer system exchanging value exists completely outside control central banks government . Over time began explore movement might align work tax professional . Later , reviewing guidance issued IRS taxation virtual currencies March 2014 , elected pivot entire accounting practice last year toward digital currency/blockchain niche Today , Daniel 30 clients include investors , contractors businesses bitcoin earnings . He presented bitcoin taxes Texas Bitcoin Conference New York Bitcoin Center , interviewed Bloomberg regarding New Jersey 's tax treatment bitcoin transactions . In following interview , Winters discusses road ahead , U.S. tax authorities users alike seek better understand tax policy rapidly expanding digital currency landscape.Is bitcoin considered money tax purposes ? Per IRS Notice 2014-21 , bitcoin considered virtual currency thus treated property federal tax purposes . In words , IRS views bitcoin similar stocks bonds . So federal tax law , purchase bitcoin later sell , gain loss transaction.Bitcoin ’ designation virtual currency connotes use medium exchange . And fact traded market determines value . However , know , backed sovereign government legal tender anywhere . So functions currency , virtual world electronically.Where definition derived ? FinCen issued extensive guidance defining digital currency . When IRS issued guidance March 2014 , took definition virtual currency directly FinCen said okay , virtual currency ’ defined tax purposes . Again big takeaway IRS guidance bitcoin tax purposes property , currency.But given bitcoin ’ global nature , ’ considered foreign currency ? The IRS view bitcoin foreign currency tax purposes . Foreign currency different classification , receives different tax treatment . In words , bitcoin get treated way bought Euros Germany converted U.S. dollars.And ’ talk bitcoin classified commodity ? There lot misinformation . So record : bitcoin also treated commodity tax purposes . This confusion likely ensued Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) regulates financial derivatives . They stated bitcoin commodity purposes CFTC . The Commission created many years ago regulate financial products , futures contracts derivatives price soybeans , corn pork bellies . A derivative basically contract whose value dependent price something else , price soybeans . So CFTC regulates financial derivatives futures contracts . What trying convey regards bitcoin also essentially futures contract derivative , charged regulating . But [ CFTC ] nothing taxation.So defined futures contract begin ? Basically , futures contract allows purchase right buy sell commodity asset set price future point time . These contracts originally created farmers , wanted guarantee price crops . These days , buy derivatives contract vast array financial assets , including bitcoin . Therefore , CFTC issued notice concerning bitcoin , meant bitcoin derivatives contracts regulated CFTC . Again , bitcoin definitely commodity tax purposes . So end day , bitcoin sale viewed way stock ? Yes . Since Bitcoin sales treated like stock sales , resulting gain either short-term long-term subject respective tax rates . Long-term sales , bitcoin held one year , subject 15 percent capital gains tax taxpayers . Taxpayers top income bracket subject 20 percent capital gains tax , applies income $ 415,050 single taxpayers , $ 466,950 married taxpayers filing jointly . Short-term sales bitcoin held one year subject ordinary income rates 39.6 percent.How accounted tax return ? With respect bitcoin , two things need reported tax return : income revenue capital gains sale assets.And capital gains calculated ? Capital gain/loss calculated subtracting purchase price , basis , virtual currency sale price . The basis given amount virtual currency fair market value , US dollars , date payment receipt . What means average user purchase $ 100 bitcoin today , asset cost basis $ 100 . Now let ’ say year goes bitcoin goes moon , doubling price . So ’ worth $ 200 . You sell get $ 200 . $ 200 minus $ 100 $ 100 capital gains , must reported tax return.But say bitcoin becomes non-taxable convert appreciates.That ’ incorrect . If receive $ 1,000 bitcoin , let ’ say , mining contract $ 1,000 income . And ’ business , viewed $ 1,000 revenue . Bottom line , ’ $ 1,000 ordinary income revenue . But also keep mind also considered capital asset , cost basis $ 1,000 . So unless convert bitcoin dollars day , ’ going gain loss transaction.How tax guidelines apply bitcoin miners earnings ? The IRS says miner receives ( bitcoin ) revenue mining business , equates U.S. dollar value virtual currency day receive . So example , say solo mining go month half without getting paid . Then one day suddenly become lucky hit big block 12 coins . The complete dollar value revenues apply date received them.How taxes viewed mining business ? Revenue reflects dollar value bitcoin business receives day . Businesses , however , reduce revenues expenses incur , irrespective whether expenses paid dollars converted bitcoin bitcoin . In words , purchase bunch , say , power supplies mining business bitcoin , expenses deductible.What bitcoin received exchange goods services ? It treated ordinary income , normal wages paid fiat currency.What miner freelance contractor receives pay bitcoin ? IRS stated clearly contractors receive bitcoin forms digital currency subject 1099 reporting rule . That means U.S. citizen permanent resident someone pays bitcoin , company obligated provide 1099 , provided least $ 600.And W-2 employees ? If someone W-2 employee employer chooses pay bitcoin , IRS states dollar value wages gets added dollars ’ received year must included end year tax document . The IRS recently released new guidance report September . Can briefly discuss ? The IRS ’ recent 31 page guidance report takes broad look bitcoin virtual currency taxation , IRS done far address , need future . The broad goals guidance follows : ( 1 ) determine virtual currencies widely used method hide income avoid US taxation ; ( 2 ) share virtual currency knowledge across IRS ; ( 3 ) identify audit techniques used determine taxpayers using virtual currencies transactions , especially offshore arrangements , attempting conceal income avoid US taxation.Is part larger enforcement effort ? Let ’ say IRS team charged determining whether bitcoin used tax evasion . This knowledge shared throughout IRS audit techniques identified nail people hiding income . They given training 300 agents , providing general overview virtual currency works.The IRS well aware people , many people , ’ properly report bitcoin transactions well aware fact enforcement mechanisms sufficient.In view pervasive believe use bitcoin forms digital currency become tax-avoidance tool globally ? It 's difficult answer question . Our firm ’ accept clients engaged tax evasion . Bottom line , trying use bitcoin avoid paying taxes smart . Since bitcoin transactions publicly available blockchain , someone associate identity particular bitcoin address , transactions right there.Any final advice actively investing and/or paid bitcoin ? Keep good records . This particularly important given history instability among exchanges fact might go moment . I get asked time likely IRS detect tax avoidance . In view , important compliant law avoid unnecessary complications tax authorities . That ’ passion : supporting people achieving aim . The recent Internal Revenue Service request Coinbase , seeking records customers purchased virtual currency 2013 2015 , led flurry media attention U.S. worldwide . This action affecting America ’ largest Bitcoin exchange — arguably comprehensive sweep virtual currency purpose identifying lawbreakers — massive implications future financial privacy taxation . Documents filed IRS signal agency ’ intent pursue egregious tax evaders , well small , everyday users use bitcoin forms digital currency potential dodge paying taxes . In John Doe Summons , IRS alleges uncovered three instances people used bitcoin evade taxes — two involving Coinbase customers . Based findings , IRS . surmises many people utilizing digital currency similar aims . This unprecedented action follows Treasury Department Inspector General report , casts blame IRS failing establish guidelines take aggressive action address believes unlawful activities part digital currency users.The request would require Coinbase hand identity full transaction records millions customers . The company immediately responded Protecting Customer Privacy notice website : “ Our customers may aware U.S. government filed civil petition yesterday federal court seeking disclosure Coinbase U.S. customers ' records three year period . The government alleged wrongdoing part Coinbase petition predicated sweeping statements taxpayers may use virtual currency evade taxes . `` Although Coinbase 's general practice cooperate properly targeted law enforcement inquiries , extremely concerned indiscriminate breadth government 's request . Our customers ’ privacy rights important us legal team process examining government 's petition . In current form , oppose government ’ petition court . We continue keep customers informed developments matter. ” By law , Coinbase companies purchase sell bitcoins required regulators capture identifying information users initiate purchase sell orders platforms . Because bitcoin transactions generally share identities people involved , tracking flow funds arisen concern IRS.While guidelines bitcoin users established IRS 2014 , tax agency long alleged receiving information exchanges like Coinbase order ensure proper tax payments captured.This escalating development IRS Coinbase could watershed moment future landscape tax regulators , U.S. globally . Bitcoin evangelist investor , Roger Ver , said Bitcoin Magazine : “ It seems obvious ( IRS ) overstepping already overly broad reach . It also makes feel extra happy American longer , citizen country much sane tax policy. ” As regulatory parameters bitcoin taxation examined , questions abound whether digital currencies emerging preferred method tax evaders , given worldwide crackdown taking place offshore banks tax havens . Tax authorities could eventually end challenging scenario monitoring enforcement standpoint , given rapid proliferation digital currencies like Monero zCash feature increasing levels privacy , complexity security . By estimates , number online market trades well 700 growing day . Online sites CoinMarketCap CoinCap offer overview expansive nature digital currency landscape.Legal professional , Adella Toulon-Foerster , spearheads crypto/alternative currency practice Cogent Law Group Washington , D.C. , told Bitcoin Magazine believes IRS 's absurdly broad request obvious fishing expedition sort free society would never passed straight face test . She also thinks dark terms happen hands fickle judiciary often shown little regard due process , even less reluctance unreasonable search seizure.But , says , least know particular summons . “ In era secret programs mass surveillance , sneak peek warrants , secret courts make 1984 look like bedtime story , one imagine little financial privacy bitcoin users really , regardless made known public. ” That said , offers reminder , definition , blockchain publicly viewable ledger . “ Every transaction provides another thread information lead identity bitcoin account holder . Ultimately , Bitcoin blockchain like giant game Sudoku federal law enforcement manpower computing resources win. ” Perry Woodin , computer engineer CEO blockchain governance company , Node40 , offered couple pragmatic solutions simplifying tax environment . First , says , IRS needs clarify update tax guidelines digestible consumer. “ Right IRS looking reduce noncompliance among people cryptocurrencies digital assets . Problem , I ’ think people quite know ’ supposed report order comply . The guidance currently clear , particularly terms calculate gains losses. ” This confusion ties second recommendation , proposes development software system computer protocol follows establishes IRS uses compliance guidelines , user , investor , digital currency compile report end fiscal year. “ It would allow person show unrealized gains losses entire virtual currency portfolio , hand accountant format easily understood , consistent accurate . This national standard would provide information manner consistent customized Portfolio Insight Reports Node40 provides DASH clients. ” Wooden believes vast majority digital currency holdings held bitcoin , logical place IRS expand U.S. enforcement efforts . “ They wanted go bitcoin ’ big fish terms figuring work compliance issues . Once figure bitcoin , going apply findings digital currencies. ” This things get little tricky , according Wooden . “ All course tied whether particular cryptocurrency uses transparent blockchain . zCash Monero use opaque blockchain means people verify transaction blockchain parties transaction . So people brazen enough want skirt type regulation would make use opaque blockchain , would subjected live full life cryptocurrency without able ever cash fiat dollars . Because person would run risk flagged. ” Given IRS crackdown , Wooden advises involved holding trading digital currencies , using day-to-day transactions , begin carefully documenting transactions . Eventually , tax compliance going require collection information , organized users terms assets , easier things day comes . “ If ’ shifting assets place , ’ going major headache real nightmare comply tax reporting agencies. ” The European Commission ’ recent decision delay new anti-money laundering legislation six-months latest string new developments impacting digital currencies EU . This proposed directive pushed back June 2017 , proposes stricter controls around corporate entity structures virtual currencies , greater powers granted tax authorities investigate crimes . A January 25 , 2017 vote European Parliament ’ Economic Monetary Affairs scheduled moves wider vote European Parliament.Terrorist acts Brussels Paris , along tax evasion concerns following Panama Papers scandal , led calls European Commission tightened oversight regulatory due diligence banks financial services firms . Greater accountability monitoring practices involving digital currencies forms payment proposed attempt mitigate money laundering terrorist financing activities . The commission particular targeted bitcoin increased attention , noting ease use facilitating anonymous funds transactions criminal purposes.If enacted , move would certainly create concerns among exchanges wallet providers foster transactions fiat virtual currencies would likely required turn client lists authorities . The commission also exploring possibility establishing mandatory ( self declaratory ) database digital currency users thwart digital money traders masking identity . These efforts capturing user data mirror recent efforts U.S. Department Treasury identify users bitcoin exchange Coinbase.In addition , national financial intelligence units charged monitoring suspicious transactions data pertaining money laundering issued powers . This includes ability demand information banking financial services firms irrespective whether reports suspicious activity issued.Finally , beneficial owners business entities closely watched tax evasion purposes would subject severe noncompliance penalties fines.Efforts enacting regulatory controls also afoot nation-by-nation basis . Germany Austria funding project targeting financial crimes , emphasis digital currencies . Concerned proliferation digital currencies used independent central banks authorities , collaborative effort known BITCRIME bring together funding German Federal Ministry Education Research ( BMBF ) Austrian Federal Ministry Transport , Innovation Technology ( BMVIT ) .Switzerland also set introduce legislation 2017 , includes licensure FinTech companies . There also plans establish regulatory “ sandbox , ” innovation ecosystem , firms involved experimental early stage innovation projects . Moreover , Financial Market Supervisory Authority serve primary regulator , plans pursue deeper efforts aimed understanding digital currencies blockchain technology.Joe Ciccolo , Founder U.S. based BitAML , provides regulatory compliance solutions digital currency startups , sees various pockets state-by-state regulation anathema purpose EU . “ State-level licensure delayed growth innovation United States , placed country disadvantage compared peers . The EU appears interested raising barriers entry match U.S. ” He goes note U.S. EU appear switching trajectory licensure . “ In U.S. , regulators lawyers working piecing together national license regime limited charter alleviate burden state-by-state licensing . Meanwhile , EU appears transitioning single member-based licensing approach country-by-country approach. ” Paweł Kuskowski , CEO Co-Founder compliance verification platform Coinfirm advisory board International Compliance Association , group responsible developing knowledge rules regulations regarding compliance AML Central Eastern Europe , building international cooperation region . Kuskowski says new EU regulations put almost standards digital currency entities current standards traditional financial concerns . He feels crypto blockchain market ready comply since compliance typically encompasses large investment ongoing costs , done traditional way . This , notes , may mean certain exchanges wallets could pushed market.Says Kuskowski : “ In lot discussions clients companies ecosystem find spending 25 percent time pouring enormous amounts money compliance . This acceptable . At end day , businesses able focus business , serving clients , developing new products opposed compliance. ” Despite challenges developments creating digital currency landscape , Kuskowski also believes case made regulatory efforts aimed reducing criminal activity keeping world safe . “ Whether like , sector needs regulations protect customer limit money laundering terrorist financing . This certainty see Europe EU AML Directive ’ seeing OCC IRS . Despite effect stunting damaging growth digital currency ecosystem creating regulatory uncertainty , I believe ultimately provide clearer path towards commercial institutional adoption growth. ” India ’ Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced November 9 , 2016 , 500 1000 rupee notes would taken circulation effort reduce corruption , terrorism , black money counterfeiting , longer accepted legal tender India . His surprise announcement caused chaos country citizens scrambled adjust new monetary norm banned 85 percent cash circulation.This move meant bring billions dollars worth unaccounted money back India ’ economy . The Indian economy thus far run primarily cash transactions . This , turn , left substantial proportion India ’ national income unaccounted , ’ fall tax net . According research note Ambit Capital Research , size India ’ untaxed black market economy worth $ 460 billion . In “ cashless ” India , financial transactions easily traceable , previously unaccounted transactions fall net tax authorities.The demonetization two highest-denomination notes India led increase use electronic payment services big step toward cashless society . This , turn , two key benefactors : e-money payment companies bitcoin.E-Money Stocks Are RallyingAs reported Bloomberg , e-money stocks soared since Prime Minister Modi announced wants India become cashless society . India ’ publicly listed electronic cash companies ’ stock prices surged wake currency reform November . They expected continue outperform since government introduced range discounts making digital instead cash payments.Of 23 e-payment solutions companies listed India ’ National Stock Exchange , 5 key outperformers since new currency reform.The stock prices e-commerce software developers Intense Technologies Ltd. Vedavaag Systems Ltd. increased 50 percent , e-payment service provider RS Software India Ltd. , technology solutions provider Aurionpro Solutions Ltd. telecom solutions provider Tanla Solutions Ltd. rallied 20 percent.On day announcement , Credit Suisse Singapore made strategic investment Vakrangee Ltd. , provides digital financial services governments lenders , buying 3.83 million shares firm thereby signaling prepared bet profitable future sector India.A . K. Prabhakar , Head Research IDBI Capital Mumbai , told Bloomberg team expects “ double-digit revenues growth e-governance firms next 3 4 years government systematically encourages cashless transactions ” “ growth digital modes payments continue strong safety increased charges reduced. ” According Reserve Bank India , digital payments increased almost 50 percent November December , shows shift toward cashless economy happening despite initial chaos country . This development bode well e-payment solutions providers mobile money services.Bitcoin Is Booming IndiaIndia ’ aggressive move toward becoming cashless society , however , benefiting e-money companies . It also created boom bitcoin world ’ seventh largest economy.According data compiled Coin Dance , trading volumes peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange LocalBitcoins spiked aggressively India since November 9 , leading Indian bitcoin exchanges Zebpay , Unocoin Coinsecure witnessing surge new users coming onto platform exchange rupees bitcoins.According Zebpay Co-Founder Saurabh Agarwal , Zebpay ’ trade volumes increased 25 percent October November ; 50,000 new users sign exchange month November alone , well usual 20,000 new-user increases experienced previous months.Coinsecure experienced 300 percent increase user sign-ups November , Unocoin user base increase threefold wake India ’ currency reform . While bitcoin merchant adoption still next none India , new currency reform subsequent push toward digital payments give bitcoin boost means making online payments . More merchant adoption also lead individuals adopting digital currency , , turn , help bitcoin flourish India ’ future cashless society . It appears global fight Bitcoin money laundering turned notch.Last week , 400 financial investigators money laundering , cybercrime financial intelligence units , well experts asset recovery relevant private sector representatives , met Global Conference Countering Money Laundering Digital Currencies Qatar.Held January 16 18 , 2017 , event organized Working Group Virtual Currencies . This joint initiative Europol , law enforcement agency European Union ; Interpol , intergovernmental organization facilitating international police cooperation ; Basel Institute Governance , independent not-for-profit competence center specializing financial crime.According Basel Institute Governance , conference “ aimed provide law enforcement agencies private sector tools understanding necessary detect , counter investigate criminal uses virtual currencies. ” As concrete result , attendees agreed list shared recommendations.Cracking Down BitcoinSeveral recommendations specifically refer Bitcoin digital currencies , others concern money laundering general . If recommendations followed , would significantly increase regulation digital currency space worldwide make anonymous use digital currency much difficult.Perhaps importantly , recommendations suggest bitcoin exchanges wallet providers regulated much way financial sector . While digital currency space still officially regulated many countries , background identity checks Know Your Customer ( KYC ) Anti-Money Laundering ( AML ) regulation could become mandatory anyone wants buy , sell store bitcoin.Additionally , bitcoin mixing services — exchange bitcoins different bitcoins break path particular piece currency — subject several recommendations. “ All countries advised take action Digital Currencies Mixers/Tumblers , ” per release Basel Institute Governance . “ Such services designed exclusively anonymize transactions make impossible Law Enforcement Agencies detect trace suspicious transactions . The existence companies continue tolerated. ” The recommendations also suggest law enforcement agencies cooperate across borders identifying “ suspicious Bitcoin addresses threaten economic stability ” even “ unexplained wealth ” considered crime.Connection CybercrimeThe Working Group Virtual Currencies established September last year , response popularity digital currencies like bitcoin illegal purposes.In 2015 report , Europol wrote bitcoin becoming “ common currency ” cybercriminals , accounting 40 percent identified criminal-to-criminal payments. “ Bitcoin longer used preferentially within Darknet marketplaces increasingly adopted types cybercrime well , ” agency noted.Examples include cryptoware like CryptoLocker Curve-Tor-Bitcoin ( malware locks computers demands ransom unlock ) , DDoS extortion , commercial distribution child abuse , credit card fraud more.Last week , President Donald Trump signed executive order build wall along U.S.–Mexico border promised presidential election campaign . Aside ethical practical issues building border wall , issue financed also raised opponents campaign . Trump ’ proposed solution funding wall either heavily tax U.S.–Mexico remittances fully prohibit altogether , funds needed build wall stay U.S.According World Bank , U.S.–based Mexican immigrants send around $ 26 billion annually families back home Mexico . Trump ’ proposed legislation would hit Mexican families rely remittances U.S.–based relatives hard . The Mexican economy would also suffer multibillion-dollar remittance inflow Mexico adds substantially country ’ domestic spending . In light Trump ’ proposed policies fund border wall , remittances U.S. Mexico jumped ten-year high Trump ’ election win November anticipation possible legislation restricting cross-border money transfers Mexico . Remittances month November jumped almost 25 percent compared month prior year , according data collated Mexican central bank.Will Bitcoin Be Answer New Legislation Is Imposed ? If U.S.–Mexico remittances using traditional channels banks large money transfer operators ( MTOs ) , Western Union MoneyGram , heavily taxed severely restricted , bitcoin remittances could offer solution.Bitcoin allows users send receive money anywhere world low cost using online mobile wallets make transfer . Furthermore , legal restrictions money transfers could easily circumvented using digital currency , paperwork needs filed sending money abroad . That way , documented undocumented Mexican immigrants would still able send money back home without restrictions , new laws put place . Alternatively bitcoin , anonymous digital currencies DASH , Monero Zcash could also used make cross-border money transfers , Trump decide go legislation attempt crack bitcoin remittances.Bitcoin MexicoThe main reason bitcoin ’ taken notable market share $ 500 billion global remittance market challenge transferring fiat currency bitcoin bitcoin back fiat currency without pay much bid/offer spread costs . Illiquid local exchanges developing countries easily hike cost remittance extent would make sense use traditional money transfer solutions.Fortunately , Mexican bitcoin users , several exchanges choose needing convert bitcoin pesos vice versa . Mexico ’ main bitcoin exchanges include Bitso , Volabit LocalBitcoins.Given liquidity U.S-based , Mexico-based international exchanges residents two nations access , costs converting bitcoin fiat currency reasonable low , making bitcoin remittances U.S. Mexico viable solution Trump ’ remittance restrictions enforced . Furthermore , bitcoin remittance companies Abra Cashaa aim make cashing bitcoins local fiat currency easier . In terms bitcoin regulation , Mexico taken stance similar many international peers . In April 2014 , Mexico ’ National Commission Protection Defense Users Financial Services issued warning risks using bitcoin stating legal tender regulated Mexican authorities . Therefore , commission warned , “ individual business uses accepts virtual currencies means payment risk responsibility use type asset entails high volatility potential monetary losses. ” In words , bitcoin illegal commission warns use due risks involved dealing digital currency.Not surprisingly , following Trump ’ election win November , bitcoin trading volumes Mexico global peer-to-peer exchange LocalBitcoins country ’ leading bitcoin exchange , Bitso , increased substantially Mexican bitcoin users moved funds away weakening peso better-performing currency.Should Trump succeed imposing strict remittance restrictions U.S. Mexico , could become first case study bitcoin remittance succeeding actually become viable means make cross-border payments . As Dutch proverb goes : “ The soup eaten hot served. ” Meaning : The threat often carried thoroughly initially presented.Bitcoin Magazine recently reported investigative arm Dutch tax authority — FIOD — wants lower bar prosecution unlicensed bitcoin traders . As part effort , FIOD aims mixing services recognized money-laundering indicators . Users mixing services would assumed guilty , Dutch financial newspaper Financieele Dagblad ( FD ) wrote , unless could prove otherwise.The FIOD nuanced reports . Speaking Bitcoin Magazine , press officer tax authority explained recognizing something money laundering indicator mean illegal itself. “ But mean indicates money laundering , ” added.Expanding reasoning , press officer explained tax agency established money-laundering typology includes several factors.These include , example , location transaction made ; public space like McDonald ’ suspect regular office . “ Similarly , whether exchanger keeps administration , kind compensation charges , customer verified , whether physical cash used , amounts involved , visibility exchanger public websites official government records , whether communication happened encrypted form , ” press officer said.And soon , perhaps , also use bitcoin mixers.Darknet MarketsBitcoin used relatively anonymously . This made digital currency popular means exchange darknet markets like AlphaBay Silk Road , also increasingly used cybercrimes , ransomware . In report published last year , Europol — law enforcement agency European Union — said 40 percent online transactions illegal ends made bitcoin.Darknet market merchants typically exchange earned bitcoins fiat currencies . While trading bitcoin fiat illegal The Netherlands , exchanges apply strict Anti–Money Laundering ( AML ) Know Your Customer ( KYC ) standards . This usually required banks work with.Darknet merchants , therefore , often prefer exchange bitcoins FIOD refers “ bitcoincashers ” : exchanges dealers comply rules . They often offer services via largely unregulated websites like LocalBitcoins.com , typically meet person trade bitcoins cash fiat currency . These bitcoincashers sell bitcoins regular exchange brokerage.That ’ bitcoincashers caught . If deposit large amounts tick many boxes above-mentioned money-laundering typology , investigation started . And since bitcoin transactions traceable blockchain , cases , investigation also leads original criminals crime.That ’ bitcoincashers well darknet merchants cybercriminals increasingly make use bitcoin mixers . On hosted sites , like bitmixer.io , mixers exchange bitcoins different bitcoins , cut links blockchain.If mixers become money-laundering indicator , using would longer shield bitcoincashers effectively.PrivacyWithin Bitcoin community , many concerned lack privacy offered Bitcoin . Not bitcoin users want world know spend money , earn much — even ’ breaking laws.As , series new mixing instruments developed designed past years . These include JoinMarket , ValueShuffle TumbleBit , alternative digital currencies offering increased privacy , like Monero Zcash , gained popularity too.When asked Bitcoin Magazine , FIOD spokesperson acknowledge bitcoin mixing also done perfectly valid , privacy-related reasons.He noted , however , “ We believe use cases represent majority . Compare 500 euro note . This legal tender ( ) . However , someone pays 500 euro bill going find suspicious . We believe true mixing bitcoins. ” On January 1 , 2017 , Central Bank United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) published new framework covering digital payments country . According new “ Regulatory Framework For Stored Values Electronic Payment Systems , ” applicable electronic payment services providers , “ Virtual Currencies ( transactions thereof ) prohibited. ” In new framework , definition virtual currencies central bank identified “ type digital unit used medium exchange , unit account , form stored value. ” This would suggest bitcoin digital currencies officially banned UAE central bank January 1.However , February 1 , Mubarak Rashed Khamis Al Mansouri , governor UAE central bank , informed Gulf News statement saying “ regulations cover ‘ virtual currency , ’ defined type digital unit used medium exchange , unit account , form stored value . In context , regulations apply bitcoin digital currencies , currency exchanges , underlying technology blockchain. ” He added digital currencies “ currently review Central Bank new regulations issued appropriate. ” In statement , Governor Al Mansouri highlighted fintech development play integral role future UAE ’ financial industry , reason new framework introduced beginning year.While new framework e-payments confusion surrounding bitcoin regulations may sound worrying , reality UAE aims become leading center blockchain innovation 2020 intends become first government execute transactions using distributed ledger technology.To achieve goal , Dubai ’ Crown Prince , Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum , launched Dubai blockchain strategy improve inefficiencies governmental departments eliminating paper transactions reducing work hours involved handling paper transactions . Furthermore , blockchain strategy also aims facilitate company incorporations Emiratis , expats foreign investors creating blockchain-based incorporation system.As UAE aims become leader blockchain technology , would extremely surprising regulators would stunt innovation area restricting prohibiting use digital currencies . Hence , future bitcoin regulations UAE likely favor blockchain startups bitcoin economy.It appears Venezuelan authorities enough Bitcoin . Over past two weeks , police Latin American country arrested eight Bitcoin miners three different cities . While accused cybercrime stealing energy , others merely selling ASIC hardware . In addition , country ’ main exchange — Surbitcoin — halt operations , company ’ bank closed account.While country ’ economy state turmoil , national currency — bolivar — hyperinflationary free fall time , socialist regime Latin American country subsidizes electricity point ’ almost free . As covered popular article published reason.com last November , made Bitcoin mining popular among tech-savvy Venezuelans . Even yields older , secondhand hardware provide lifeline order food products medicines outside country.There official law Bitcoin mining Venezuela , using digital currency legal : travel agency Destinia even decided ditch bolivar exclusively accept bitcoin . Regardless , country plagued scarce electricity regular blackouts , appears ( ab ) using cheap energy purpose Bitcoin mining go well local authorities.In biggest bust past couple weeks , Policía Nacional Bolivariana ( PNB ) raided warehouse Valencia , third-largest city Venezuela . As reported reason.com , building hosted 11,000 ASIC miners , allegedly consumed enough energy entire village . The arrested duo accused stealing electricity , also cybercrime , financing terrorism exchange fraud.In separate case week , four people operating 300 ASIC machines arrested agents Cuerpo de Investigaciones Científicas , Penales Criminalísticas ( CICPC ) relatively small town Charallave . Somewhat similarly , four suspects charged electricity theft internet fraud , Spanish-language Bitcoin news site CriptoNoticias reported . According director CICPC , miners affected “ consumption stability ” electricity service Charallave , reported reason.com.And , perhaps notable case , PNB also arrested two men Caracas . As opposed suspects , men mining Bitcoin . Rather , attempted sell mining equipment MercadoLibre , online marketplace . It currently clear men arrested exactly.And top , Venezuela ’ biggest bitcoin exchange , Surbitcoin , halt operations well . According Surbitcoin , exchange received notice bank Banesco February 2 bank account would closed next day . The exchange says establishing new commercial structure prevent situations like one future , meantime recommends customers use LocalBitcoins . Perhaps unsurprisingly , trading volume LocalBitcoins broke records last week , 1.12 billion bolivars ’ ( approximately $ 337,000 ) worth bitcoin exchanged.While seems Venezuelan authorities increased pressure past two weeks , first time Bitcoin miners arrested country . About year ago , Bitcoin miner arrested jailed three months charges electricity theft . Unsurprisingly , Venezuelan miners therefore keep operations relatively small hidden authorities.In move raised eyebrows among tech policy advocates , Reps. Jared Polis ( D-Colo. ) David Schweikert ( R-Ariz. ) officially launched Congressional Blockchain Caucus early February . First announced September 2016 , bipartisan working group target policy advancement blockchain-oriented technologies digital currencies.In official statement , Polis expressed optimism next step caucus : “ Blockchain [ technology ] potential transform 21st century economy , ” Polis said . “ Lawmakers need understand world rapidly changes , ’ responsibility ensure craft policies adapt laws match ingenuity . Blockchain [ technology ] ’ potential reshape everything financial industry , supply chains , cybersecurity , healthcare something embrace . I look forward caucus ’ upcoming policy briefings meetings educate members Congress innovative technologies. ” Rep . Schweikert furthered sentiments . “ Open blockchain networks distributed ledger technologies still new , ’ critical members Congress begin comprehending current applications future use cases . It critically important United States remain competitive regarding emerging technologies , distributed ledger technology open , secure , efficient technology backbone ’ looking for. ” The primary aim Congressional Blockchain Caucus educate , engage offer research assist policymakers pursuing thoughtful regulatory approaches issues facing rapidly growing blockchain network landscape.Polis ’ cohort Schweikert replaced former Co-Chair Blockchain Caucus , Rep. Mick Mulvaney ( R–South Carolina ) , successfully confirmed U.S. President Donald Trump ’ budget director tight , heated vote.Rep . Mulvaney widely seen pro-Bitcoin major blockchain advocate . There growing belief appointment fuel integration blockchain technology U.S. government , even allowing Bitcoin find safe legal onerous federal regulations.An Outside-the-Beltway PerspectiveSteven J. Ehrlich , associate New York–based Spitzberg Partners LLC , offered insights Bitcoin Magazine new caucus future blockchain technology government . Spitzberg Partners consultancy assists clients development , market entry M & A strategies Europe , North America beyond. “ I applaud launch Congressional Blockchain Caucus happy see issue continue moving forward following ascension former Co-Chair Mick Mulvaney , Rep. David Schweikert taking place , ” said Ehrlich.Ehrlich believes formal mechanism discuss potential use cases public policy implications technology critical achieving mainstream diffusion information.He says become harder argue technology strictly law-enforcement issue exclusively useful illicit activities dedicated group Washington centered promoting use. “ I think U.S. continues face challenges regulating industry outlook uncertain . Moreover I believe ’ early make broad assessments impact President Trump , initial outlook — although Mulvaney could temper — somewhat negative . Given strong focus security I see unlikely would give benefit doubt technology , including virtual currencies , whiff impropriety. ” From policy regulatory point view , Ehrlich believes initial focus likely center around security consumer protection . Above else , says , responsibility government protect citizens threats , terrorist attack , criminal activity negligence . So initial threshold blockchain application cross.Back September , Rep. Mulvaney said , “ Blockchain technology potential revolutionize financial services industry , U.S. economy delivery government services. ” Ehrlich agreed qualifiers : “ First , end state described long ways necessitate series trials errors combined piecemeal approach across different industries. “ Second , important remember building technology stacks scratch . There legacy systems across every industry must integrated , updated replaced , creates additional complications. “ Third , often use terms blockchain distributed ledger technologies monoliths , not. ” Ehrlich contends many different platforms ecosystems development point either one win way multiple blockchains communicate one another . “ A siloed approach work scale , ” said.According Ehrlich , assuming hurdles cleared , blockchain technology offers potential add transparency , speed efficiency virtually industry requires shared records knowledge. “ From cybersecurity point view , able absolute certainty systems records maintaining integrity confidentiality invaluable .

The formation coalition follows creation Blockchain Alliance , also co-founded Chamber Digital Commerce , help combat criminal activity linked digital currencies acting resource law enforcement providing open forum private sector , law enforcement regulators discuss digital assets.While early bitcoin adopters , cypherpunks “ bank ” idealists would prefer taxman stay business , reality bitcoin wants succeed viable transactional currency investment asset class , needs clear guidance tax authorities digital currencies digital assets need taxed . This help bitcoin adoption growth bitcoin economy U.S.The COIN ETF no-go.Almost four years making , highly anticipated verdict published earlier today , U.S. Securities Exchange Commission rejected Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust exchange traded fund ( ETF ) .An ETF investment fund holds assets like stocks , commodities bonds , trades stock exchanges . This ETF , Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust intended listed COIN , would let institutional investors invest bitcoin , without actually needing buy hold digital currency ; would held custodian , Gemini.In decision , SEC singled two major concerns regarding application . First , exchange must surveillance-sharing agreements significant markets trading underlying commodity derivatives commodity . And second , markets must regulated. “ [ T ] Commission find proposed rule change consistent [ … ] Exchange Act—which requires rules national securities exchange designed , among things , prevent fraudulent manipulative acts practices protect investors public interest — Commission believes significant markets bitcoin unregulated , therefore , Exchange entered , would currently unable enter , type surveillance-sharing agreement helps address concerns potential fraudulent manipulative acts practices market Shares. ” Gemini — bitcoin exchange operated Winklevoss twins proposed custodian COIN — properly regulated New York state , accounts relatively low trade volumes . Meanwhile major bitcoin markets , SEC notes , currently located outside US jurisdiction.Immediately following announcement , price bitcoin dropped sharply $ 1290 $ 970 sitting around $ 1120 time publication.ReactionsUnsurprisingly , everyone agrees verdict. “ This creates chicken-and-egg problem , ” Coin Center ’ Jerry Brito commented . “ How develop well-capitalized regulated markets U.S. Europe financial innovators ’ allowed bring products market grow domestic demand digital currencies like Bitcoin ? ” In spite disappointment among many bitcoiners result , plenty community nonplussed news . # bitcoin 's value unaffected ‘ plan B ’ political attacks cash & gold , access funds transfers , geopolitical uncertainty . ETFs dont add # bitcoin utility , give passive investors easier way buy future potential , though lacking bearer property . For , even viewed affirmation : The ETF denied bitcoin ca n't regulated , ca n't surveilled . Feature , bug . “ The disapproval change Bitcoin ’ compelling fundamental growth story , ” Spencer Bogart , Managing Director Research Head Blockchain Capital , said Bitcoin Magazine . “ We always viewed potential ETF low-probability event would accelerate de-risk trajectory bitcoin already past 8 years. ” We choose go Moon `` authority '' approved mission , claimed could n't without . Future ImplicationsBesides COIN , two bitcoin ETFs still running : SolidX Bitcoin Trust Bitcoin Investment Trust ( BIT ) , sponsored Barry Silbert ’ Grayscale Investments . SolidX Bitcoin Trust due considered approval SEC end month — BIT take end year.However , given motivation reject Winklevoss ’ ETF , Bogart considers unlikely two luck SEC. “ The grounds disapproval suggest Bitcoin ETFs going approval process also unlikely approved , ” said . “ It disapproved markets bitcoin primarily trades largely unregulated , , SEC would unable enter “ surveillance-sharing ” agreements , among things , help Commission stomp market manipulation. ” The SEC , meanwhile , ended order positive note — least long-term prospects Bitcoin ETF. “ The Commission notes bitcoin still relatively early stages development , time , regulated bitcoin-related markets significant size may develop , ” decision states . “ Should markets develop , Commission could consider whether bitcoin ETP would , based facts circumstances presented , consistent requirements Exchange Act. ” Santander Bank , $ 90 billion Spanish financial institution banking group , recently began close accounts users involved bitcoin trading . According U.K.-based bitcoin trading firm Bittylicious , customers Santander Bank received official letters account termination almost immediately utilizing bank accounts purchase sell bitcoin.Since mid-2015 , major banks financial service providers countries including U.S. Australia singled customers businesses involved bitcoin trading operations . In September 2015 , Rod Sim , chairman Australian Competition Consumer Commission , opened investigation country ’ largest banks , Commonwealth Bank , suspected abruptly terminating user accounts without sending prior notifications.At time , Queensland Nationals Senator Matthew Canavan wrote : “ The actions banks would appear directly engage competition financial services industry stands — , effectively nipping bud growth potential competitors , likely substantially reduce potential future competition detriment consumers future. ” The unexpected closure bank accounts bitcoin users businesses led local digital currency businesses terminating services . Businesses refused provide bitcoin payment trading services within Australia due limited methods facilitating fiat reserves.Similar Case U.S. A similar trend emerged Europe , Santander Bank started send official bank account termination notices users suspected using accounts trade digital currencies bitcoin ether.The letter acquired Bittylicious emphasized bank able provide banking services users declined provide explanations decision . Several users received identical bank account closure letters Santander Bank business manager Victoria Wells , wrote : “ We want let know ’ offer banking facilities anymore . Under terms conditions account , withdraw banking facilities giving notice writing , line company policy , ’ give information ’ made decision. ” Santander Bank ’ account-termination message nearly identical Australian banks ’ letters October 2015 . During period , Bitcoin Magazine reported Commonwealth Bank , amongst major Australian banks , refused provide additional explanation clarification bitcoin business user accounts terminated. “ Our members said banks remarkably unwilling provide explanations ceasing provide services ADCCA members . Our members , may end partners competitors banks future , currently mercy established financial institutions , ” Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association Chairman Ron Tucker told Bitcoin Magazine time.The decision Santander Bank close bank accounts bitcoin users controversial clear legality bitcoin Europe U.S . Most bitcoin exchanges well regulated strictly compliant financial money transmission regulations . Since exchanges suspended operating without proper Know Your Customer ( KYC ) Anti-Money Laundering ( AML ) systems , regulatory aspect bitcoin ’ factor closing accounts bitcoin users.Currently , major banks including Santander Bank focusing development digital currencies unique financial infrastructure , utilizing Bitcoin ’ fundamental blockchain technology . It could perceived , therefore , Santander Bank demonstrating hostile behavior toward bitcoin users protect interest blockchain technology.In fact , Santander Bank recently left R3 consortium focus blockchain technology development consortium clarified need blockchain technology order provide essential infrastructure global financial industry . Santander also extremely optimistic toward future blockchain technology , according bank , technology cut operating costs banks $ 20 billion 2022.Since beginning April , price bitcoin stabilized $ 1,000 mark started push toward recent all-time high $ 1,263 . The main drivers rally positive news Japan Russia.Since April 1 , price bitcoin rallied $ 1,070 peak month ’ high $ 1,227 April 11 . At time writing , bitcoin trading around $ 1,218 according BitcoinAverage . The market value bitcoin increased around $ 17.5 billion April 1 surpass $ 19.5 billion April 20 , according data compiled CoinMarketCap.Bitcoin Is Big JapanJapan officially recognized bitcoin legal payment method April 1 , gave bitcoin immediate price boost following announcement . Not bitcoin legally used Japan make purchases send remittances , digital currency also exempt sales tax.Furthermore , following legalization bitcoin , two major retailers announced intentions offer bitcoin payment method stores . Retail giants Bic Camera Recruit Lifestyle announced trial bitcoin payments anticipation possible increase use bitcoin consumer purchases . As Recruit Lifestyle uses point-of-sale app AirREGI , enables merchants accept bitcoin payments , potential quarter million Japanese retailers may soon accept bitcoin payments end year.Given Japan become trading hub bitcoin , positive news coming country boosted local demand also increased bitcoin buying globally . Traders likely optimistic since new legitimate status could give price bitcoin substantial boost driven real demand coming months.Russia Is Changing Its Stance Toward BitcoinRussia tricky jurisdiction bitcoin users startups , Russia ’ central bank , Bank Russia , effectively banned use digital currencies 2014 fear would undermine Russian ruble , struggling time.The bitcoin ban resulted bitcoin websites shut led several lawmakers speaking use digital currencies Russia , suggesting vehicle money laundering terrorist financing “ used individuals legal entities , ” according Russian Prosecutor General ’ Office.However , end 2016 , sentiment toward bitcoin Russia started change . The Russian Federal Tax Service issued letter October 2016 stated Russian law digital currencies illegal prohibitions citizens companies comes dealing . While letter clear change sentiment Russian authorities , gave clear indication digital currencies regulated Russia.Last week , however , Russia ’ Deputy Finance Minister Alexey Moiseev told Bloomberg interview Russian central bank government working joint position could see digital currencies bitcoin become recognized legal payment method soon 2018 . Meanwhile , counterpart Russian central bank , Deputy Governor Olga Skorobogatova , stated February authorities intend decide mid-2017 whether digital currencies considered cash , asset security.Russia ’ change sentiment toward bitcoin helped boost currency ’ price likely increase demand world ’ 11th largest economy , could potentially push price bitcoin new highs months come.As Bitcoin adopted users every day , need determine integrate mainstream society becomes even pressing . One major question continues traditional laws apply Bitcoin use.Many determinations could major implications Bitcoin holders , play bigger role United States property laws , could ultimately govern ownership digital currency.A new white paper , “ Treatment Bitcoin Under U.S. Property Law , ” seeks analyze worlds digital currency property law intersect . The report assembled Perkins Coie , international law firm specializes blockchain technology digital currency active space since 2013 . While detailed clearly well-researched , paper ’ foremost conclusion straightforward transparent. “ We conclude property interests exist bitcoin law , multiple sources persuasive authority provide additional support conclusion , ” paper ’ authors , J. Dax Hansen Joshua L. Boehm , wrote.The paper begins overview Bitcoin ’ technological attributes mean property law apply . Using California state law benchmark Bitcoin transactions example , authors make case. “ Parties may ... enter contractual arrangements one party entrusts partial complete control private key ( ) third party still maintaining formal title bitcoin value represented applicable [ unspent transaction outputs ] , ” paper reads . “ These kinds contractual arrangements commonplace custodial , trust , escrow settings , generated well-developed legal principles generally translate bitcoin custodial contexts. ” The paper dissects academic articles country ’ foremost law professors , also , part , support idea intangible property rights apply Bitcoin : “ Property law scholars encountered bitcoin ownership issues context broader , theoretical undertakings reached ( assumed ) general conclusion ... , interests bitcoin protected property law. ” The authors move describe Bitcoin treated legal divisions , commodities taxation laws , citing fact court opinions regulatory guidance specialties , digital currency treated property. “ Although concept ‘ property ’ fundamentally matter state law United States , also important bitcoin widely treated ( assumed ) property purposes state federal statutory regimes , ” reads paper . “ These treatments assumptions already substantial consequences bitcoin sector . They therefore constitute informal persuasive legal precedent indicating bitcoin owned property. ” In acknowledgment much still determined around U.S. laws govern Bitcoin , authors also included section looking challenges treating digital currency legal property . These include multisignature arrangements , pseudoanonymity potential lack traceability associated Bitcoin platform . However , authors remain optimistic challenges overcome technology develops. “ To sure , difficulties tracing ownership particular bitcoin units across successive owners could cause challenges certain commercial use cases , ” wrote , “ blockchain technology enabled , likely continue enable , solutions obstacles arise. ” It appear worlds Bitcoin formal legal precedent rapidly coming head . As turning point approaches , familiarity relevant legal precedent crucial.During recent talk Blockchain Meetup Zurich , Pamela Morgan , CEO Third Key Solutions attorney Empowered Law PLLC , shared thoughts Bitcoin , Ethereum blockchain technology legal perspective . While claimed often hear smart contracts going replace lawyers , Morgan said believe happen ; however , added lawyers definitely need pay attention space. “ Smart contracts replace lawyers ; however , smart contracts replace lazy lawyers , ” Morgan said . “ The real question : What value provided ? ... If ’ providing value filling form ’ using form ’ used every client , guess ? Those days numbered . However , ’ providing strategy , ’ understanding business nuances risks , services going outsourced — certainly smart contracts — anytime soon. ” According Morgan , Bitcoin related technologies affect practice law every possible area . A slide Morgan ’ presentation listed 21 types law affected technology , one specific areas law explored context blockchain technology use crypto tokens alternative traditional avenues public investment.What Is Initial Coin Offering ? The first area law explored Morgan talk initial public offerings ( IPOs ) . An IPO type public offering shares company offered general public first time . There large amount regulation added costs involved process . For example , according Forbes , underwriters received $ 51 million financial data provider Markit Ltd. went public 2014.An initial coin offering ( ICO ) process percentage initial supply new digital currency project offered public . It said sorts offerings require less regulatory hassle ’ described software pre-sales rather public stock offerings , ’ unclear claim true point time.The Blockchain Doesn ’ Shield You From SEC “ For practice securities law , terrified , probably , ” Morgan said ICOs recent talk . “ If anyone selling securities U.S. citizens , get trouble SEC sure . I ’ sure jurisdictions ’ look kindly , developing area law. ” Ethereum perhaps notable project launched via ICO , sorts , ’ unclear whether SEC eventually clamp sort activity . While Ethereum Foundation contends ether product , rather security investment vehicle , claim open alternate interpretations.Morgan told Bitcoin Magazine ether presale looks less like security many today 's ICOs , ’ mean SEC appeased . “ Ethereum would n't first attempt legal sophistry semantics avoid regulation ; SEC takes dim view tactics . If eyes SEC Ethereum presale deemed security , disclaimers company deter SEC action. ” ConsenSys , incubator Ethereum projects , involved number token offerings top Ethereum platform , chief staff Jeremy Millar recently noted even fair amount skepticism viability recently launched ICO projects. “ The law cares use technologies , ” Morgan explained talk . “ If use like stock , ’ probably going regulated ’ stock. ” Differentiating Between Scams Legitimate ProjectsThere many scams Bitcoin space years , offering sort alternative token bitcoin involved high percentage fraudulent schemes.During talk , Morgan explained many bitcoin alternatives market special value offer . “ Some actually centralized , ” noted . “ Some actually pretty close I would call Ponzi scheme . Some offering guaranteed returns . It ’ kind Wild Wild West ; ’ kind mess. ” In Morgan ’ view , best way tell difference scammy kind altcoin one may offer value look Bitcoin ’ Ethereum ’ core characteristics decentralization , independence , openness consensus based proof work . “ The get away characteristics , chance dangerous kind scammy zone , ” added.Coinfirm estimates RegTech reduce compliance costs financial services companies much 50 percent.RegTech may “ next big thing ” fintech digital currency blockchain startups bump new government regulations , resulting increase demand legal compliance information help companies navigate regulatory requirements conduct risk assessments.Banks financial institutions also looking cost-effective ways assess risks using new blockchain technologies different jurisdictions modify practices minimize increasing compliance costs.Accenture estimates business compliance costs could drop 30 50 percent product level use blockchain database.In recent news release , Coinfirm estimates companies save much 50 percent using regulatory compliance technology . As recognized experts regulatory compliance field , U.K.-based startup well placed benefit growing demand.Pawel Kuskowski , Coinfirm CEO cofounder , noted recently RegTech once-in-a-generation opportunity take advantage inevitable increase rules regulations accompany new field enterprise.Kuskowski told Bitcoin Magazine : “ For us , challenges include segmented regulations cryptocurrencies blockchain transactions local levels . Bitlicense [ ] extreme example , locally driven regulations create segmentation technology , system industry organically without borders. “ That ’ one reasons active regulators influencing direction regulatory landscape . Our goal create global standard blockchain transactions AML & Compliance platform part global standard. ” SEI Gets Ahead Curve With Codify , Its New RegTech IncubatorRecognizing growing importance knowing understanding increasingly complex “ rules , ” SEI , leading U.K.-based financial services wealth management firm , launched Codify — incubator specifically RegTech firms positioning take advantage demand.Ahsan Mallick , general counsel SEI U.K. executive sponsor Codify , told Bitcoin Magazine : “ We created Codify support promising early-stage businesses developing tech solutions address world ’ growing demanding regulatory requirements. “ The importance regulatory tech ’ overstated domestic international regulation become complex types institutions , ” added.The Codify incubator offers three current startups office space SEI ’ headquarters London , mentoring SEI employees external experts like Jason Boud RegTech Forum , access SEI ’ clients potential investment opportunity pitch RegTech solutions.The three RegTech startups currently Codify Coinfirm , Enforcd Neuroprofiler.RegTech Automates Routine Compliance , Freeing Up Analysts Problem SolveThe automation regulatory compliance comes combination increasing compliance demands need cost effective.Coinfirm estimates current compliance systems catch around 2 percent money laundering , less , blockchain adoption using platform like Coinfirm ’ , 2 percent effectiveness could increase 90 percent.Amber D. Scott , whose company Outlier Solutions works digital currency blockchain startups anti-money laundering ( AML ) regulatory compliance , told Bitcoin Magazine : “ The complexity regulatory requirements increasing decade . In step , compliance costs continuously increasing period ... hurting firms ’ bottom lines. ” Scott noted , businesses , becoming impossible conduct effective transaction monitoring real sense data without automation . “ We often hear people say ‘ know clients ’ — common refrain every regulated business , regulators ’ buying . Unless prove , ’ luck ... Fortunately , automated tools excellent audit trails. ” Coinfirm recognized Blockchain AML Compliance platform , used major banks digital currencies like Dash . Its platform uses proprietary algorithms big data analytics increase efficiency , reduce costs streamline compliance near automation.It also blockchain agnostic , meaning technically adoptable type blockchain whether public like Bitcoin Dash , private blockchain solutions many large companies institutions developing.Coinfirm also promoting blockchain solution registration verification authenticity type document , record file . Their Document Verification Platform currently bringing traditional players use public blockchains like Bitcoin Dash way naturally fits already existing needs processes.The challenge RegTech encounters obtaining accurate timely data myriad legacy systems interpreting data appropriately.Scott ’ concerned growth automated RegTech : “ I ’ occasionally asked I concerned cannibalization industries automation , I think absurd question . I hope large swaths industry automated , freeing humans add real value rather performing repetitive compliance tasks . Ultimately , automation lead happier compliance geeks able focus solving novel problems. ” On January 20 , 2017 , Grayscale Investments LLC filed initial public offering ( IPO ) Bitcoin Investment Trust listed NYSE Accra exchange attempt bring bitcoin investing masses publicly tradable investment vehicle form new stock.Grayscale Investments , investment management subsidiary Barry Silbert-led Digital Currency Group , established Bitcoin Investment Trust ( BIT ) 2013 , hoping provide investors opportunity invest digital currency bitcoin without purchase securely store digital currency themselves.The Bitcoin Investment Trust , carries ticker GBTC , tracks TradeBlock XBX Index 24-hour VWAP bitcoin index charges 2 percent annual management fee . The Trust currently around $ 262 million assets management . Shares Bitcoin Investment Trust traded over-the-counter held traditional investment accounts , IRAs Roth IRAs.By going public , Grayscale Investments wants open bitcoin investment vehicle broader investor base prefers comfort investing exchange-traded fully regulated security.On May 4 , 2017 , Grayscale Investments LLC submitted amendment IPO filing SEC increasing size proposed IPO $ 500 million $ 1 billion dollars suggesting interest publicly-tradeable regulated investment vehicle tracks price bitcoin would see substantial interest institutional private investors.However , given SEC recent decisions approve long-awaited Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF ( COIN ) well SolidX Bitcoin Trust , chances Bitcoin Investment Trust ’ IPO gain regulatory approval high.While Alan Friedland , founder CEO Compcoin , ’ hold much hope ETF approval yet , agrees enough demand established institution investors bitcoin alternative asset class merit $ 1 billion IPO increase. “ Digital coins fastest growing financial market projecting 1.7 trillion dollar market cap 2025 , ” told Bitcoin Magazine.When SEC announced March would approve two proposed bitcoin exchange-traded funds , regulator stated bitcoin ETF would require `` surveillance-sharing agreements significant markets trading underlying commodity derivatives commodity . And second , markets must regulated . `` Since conditions still met bitcoin , approval Bitcoin Investment Trust looks rather unlikely . Spencer Bogart , analyst Blockchain Capital , thinks “ highly unlikely ” renewed ETF consideration approved . “ The SEC disapproved prior two ETFs took issue structure fund SEC currently considers major markets bitcoin traded unregulated , ” Bogart told Bitcoin Magazine . “ Given ’ changed since last disapproval , SEC unlikely offer different response. ” Bogart optimistic chances ETF approval outside United States . “ I think mainstream investment products first approved foreign regulatory agencies ( extent already happened ) . In regards approval U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETF , I think ’ likely SEC changes view ( e.g . regime change ) Bitcoin ecosystem changes majority activity flows highly regulated markets. ” Across China , blockchain technology recognized increasingly important development ; however , bitcoin “ virtual good ” China facing yet another challenge People ’ Bank China ( PBOC ) .On May 10 , 2017 , China ’ top-tier financial media outlet , Caixin , reported “ according person close PBOC , PBOC soon issue notice penalties BTCC , OKCoin Huobi irregularities based previous inspection past months . The major problems [ related ] illegal margin trading services lack internal controls anti-money laundering . The related penalty details already confirmed internally ; left go approval procedures. ” Caixin also stated , according source , “ regulation bitcoin exchange regulation anti-money laundering systems bitcoin exchange likely released June. ” “ A person close PBOC ” common citation used Caixin . Considered influential media China ’ economic political sphere , Caixin usually first outlet China disclose news PBOC related Bitcoin , always insider access . It , effect , mouthpiece PBOC communicates bitcoin exchanges Bitcoin community whole.It worth noting , however , Caixin often tends exaggerate PBOC ’ actual political influence . For example , PBOC inspected three biggest exchanges , Caixin said PBOC would “ thoroughly inspect regulate ” . However , official statement released PBOC merely suggested PBOC , together local financial office , would “ inspect exchanges. ” Similarly , Caixin said , “ With staunch resolution bottom-level efforts , local Financial Office PBOC [ would ] jointly resolve bitcoin exchange issue. ” The result consistent tonal bias China ’ influential media , represents interests PBOC , portray Bitcoin ’ public image China still something deeply connected price volatility money laundering , need severe government regulation . As Bitcoin ’ features like decentralization P2P transactions , Caixin remains pointedly silent.Conversely , incoming penalties regulations interpreted signal big three exchanges soon allowed resume bitcoin withdrawal , though cost . Still negative portrayal bitcoin trading shows , least short run , bitcoin China difficulty gaining legal tender status payment tool , opposed acceptance seeing Japan.The logic behind stance seems natural considering PBOC ’ version digital currency already around corner ; Caixin announced January successfully completed demo.In China , blockchain technology enjoying spring . People ’ Daily , Chinese state-run media , speaks highly . China ’ 13th Five-Year Plan national strategy includes . Local governments support it.Bitcoin , however , facing trial . The likely result bitcoin remain virtual goods . As bitcoin trading , stringent Know Your Customer ( KYC ) anti-money laundering regulations point one strategic bottom line : speculation bitcoin must result social financial instability China.To counter negative perceptions Bitcoin , one possible way improve regulatory outlook create mainstream use cases technology . Blockchain technologies like one underpins Bitcoin gaining wide acceptance across industry sectors finance healthcare real estate . Bitcoin , however , still struggling legitimacy regulation issues . Just week , fact bitcoin chosen payment method latest round global data ransomware attacks , WanaCrypt0r 2.0 malware , underscored negative perception still swirls around cryptocurrency.On recent episode Epicenter , co-hosts Brian Fabian Crain Meher Roy interviewed Peter Van Valkenburgh , Director Research Coin Center , nonprofit research advocacy center focused public policy issues facing decentralized financial networks like Bitcoin Ethereum . During interview , Van Valkenburgh explained Bitcoin currently dealing branding issue ; Coin Center laying groundwork future discussions Bitcoin regulation ; mainstream uses technology would helpful discussions around regulation.Bitcoin ’ Branding IssueVan Valkenburgh noted Coin Center struggled issues around Bitcoin brand , many mainstream associate digital currency collapse Mt . Gox drug sales darknet markets. “ We take lot meetings congressional staff , take meetings regulators [ United States ] Treasury , oftentimes ’ take credit meetings congressman ’ want , necessarily , immediately hit news ’ meeting Bitcoin people , ” said Van Valkenburgh.From Van Valkenburgh ’ viewpoint , networks like Bitcoin used “ decentralize power ” push security end users ’ devices . “ That means lose choke point regulation choke point regulation bank , choke point regulation centralized intermediary , ” explained.Van Valkenburgh went note , since control networks pushed edges , technology potentially used illicit activities.Laying Groundwork Future DebateOne illicit activities regulators journalists sometimes associate Bitcoin terrorism . Although ’ major terrorist attacks funded Bitcoin cryptocurrency point , know , Van Valkenburgh pointed ’ “ possible one day somebody use networks meaningful way ” finance sort activity.According Van Valkenburgh , one Coin Center ’ main goals prepare potential conversation would take place within government aftermath event. “ What government response tool used way lot people get upset ? ” asked Van Valkenburgh . “ Our metric success , I think truly , would reasonable response clear evidence illicit uses technology — like dangerous , illicit uses technology. ” For Van Valkenburgh , success Coin Center scenario would mean prevention push instant ban Bitcoin related technologies , along software developers getting arrested part process . Coin Center effectively laying groundwork make sure future conversations remain reasonable. “ This technology , like technologies , used good evil , ” said Van Valkenburgh . “ We , Americans , business banning technologies . We ’ business banning speech. ” More “ Legitimate ” Use Cases NeededGoing back aforementioned branding issue , one possible way improve outlook Bitcoin regulatory perspective create mainstream use cases technology . This point originally brought Crain. “ If stuff 50 million users like , ‘ This thing great . It really makes something possible I ’ . It ’ totally legitimate thing , amazing. ’ It would much harder ’ still kind fringe thing , ” said Crain.Van Valkenburgh agreed Crain ’ assessment continued , “ You need legitimate use cases emerge . You need show ’ making positive impact world — ’ bunch people getting rich token sales people using underground drug markets. ” Van Valkenburgh added Coin Center hopes clear way , least regulatory perspective , sort mainstream applications appear . “ The longer go without mainstream , legitimate uses , danger ’ , ” added.As far mainstream uses Bitcoin today , Van Valkenburgh pointed financial autonomy enabled technology , identified WikiLeaks ’ use Bitcoin get around financial blockade back 2011 specific example . However , Van Valkenburgh also added example become politically charged since allegations WikiLeaks working directly Russia appeared.Cryptocurrency regulated . Cryptocurrency regulated . Cryptocurrency ’ regulated . These common refrains emanating media days . Now lawmakers across United States around world crossroads next terms regulatory space.Bitcoin forms cryptocurrency present monumental challenge legislators , requiring broad understanding blockchain technology , especially terms impact tech innovation . Amid assertions U.S. falling behind terms Bitcoin regulation , could argued regulatory picture becoming clearer 2017.Bitcoin Magazine asked Pawel Kuskowski , CEO co-founder Coinfirm , Joe Ciccolo , president Illinois-based Bitcoin compliance firm BitAML , offer commentary regulatory activity taking place five U.S. states — Washington , Illinois , Hawaii , California Florida — regulatory landscape may look like days ahead.WashingtonLegislators Washington state building momentum around new rules businesses offering digital currency services . Senate Bill 5013 provides definition virtual currency along disclosure requirements certain information consumers . It also would require online currency exchanges within state maintain surety bond . Finally , offers definitional clarifying changes money transmitters currency exchangers regulated Uniform Money Services Act.At time writing , bill , introduced January , passed chambers state ’ legislature , clearing sent Governor Jay Inslee signature . While clear indication Governor Inslee ’ intentions , broad support bill seems suggest may pass.There already bit fallout , however , cryptocurrency-centric startups thinking twice operating state , several firms pulled past year , noting increasingly challenging regulatory environment . These include digital currency exchanges Bitfinex , Bitstamp Poloniex , latter exited Washington. “ The State Washington also appears applied relatively heavy cybersecurity component , including broad sweeping audits data systems , ” says Ciccolo . “ Cybersecurity hot-button issue continues remain headlines . Bitcoin companies wary regulatory interpretation cybersecurity fitness , especially given nascent stage Bitcoin ongoing knowledge gap pertains crypto space . For national players , seemed obvious safe choice simply exit state altogether. ” Illinois In November 2016 , Secretary Bryan A. Schneider Illinois Department Financial Professional Regulation ( IDFPR ) announced new initiative implications cryptocurrencies state . This “ Digital Currency Regulatory Guidance ” Illinois ’ attempt provide regulatory clarity digital currencies , Bitcoin , Dogecoin , Litecoin , Ethereum Zcash . The proposed guidance provides IDFPR ’ interpretation Illinois ’ Transmitters Money Act ( TOMA ) related various activities tied digital currencies.Says Ciccolo : “ The IDFPR Secretary Schneider continue deliver state ’ promise encouraging supporting innovation FinTech , Bitcoin blockchain [ technology ] . What ’ Illinois quite possibly unprecedented area financial regulation . Our state regulators listening thoughtfully engaging industry considering impact laws regulations . I ’ optimistic continued growth financial innovation Land Lincoln , Chicago center new era financial services. ” HawaiiIn highly publicized move , prominent Bitcoin Ethereum exchange Coinbase announced forced cease supporting customers State Hawaii due called “ impractical ” “ untenable ” regulatory policies surrounding Bitcoin state . In September 2016 , Coinbase first notified policy demanded cryptocurrency operators hold case reserves equivalent values held customers.This development came Hawaii exploring bill would establish working group examining potential role digital currencies blockchain technology advancing tourism state . According bill ’ text contained House Bill 1481 : “ Digital currencies bitcoin broad benefits Hawaii . A large portion Hawaii ’ tourism market comes Asia use bitcoin virtual currency expanding. ” Leaders Coinbase said “ heartened ” bill introduced would look forward working regulators . In meantime , Ciccolo remarked : “ Given commitment compliance strong resources , exit Coinbase suggests stand chance Aloha State . Indeed , case reserve requirement overly burdensome quite frankly utterly impractical . Since Coinbase holds BitLicense , could said Hawaii inhospitable Bitcoin New York ? Let ’ hope not. ” CaliforniaCalifornia ’ Assembly Bill 1123 , version New York ’ infamous BitLicense , proposed . It reads : “ This bill would enact Virtual Currency Act . The bill would prohibit person engaging virtual currency business , defined , state unless person licensed Commissioner Business Oversight exempt licensure requirement , provided. ” Says Kuskowski , CEO co-founder Coinfirm : “ In relation particular proposed bill California , bill strong similarities New York ’ BitLicense obviously direction go , saw effects particular regulation result New York ’ loss prominence crypto hub . But California ’ unique position technology innovation startup capital world , would even catastrophic effect N.Y. version. ” Kuskowski goes say costly fees bureaucratic administration associated legislation would likely hinder innovators startups applying even operating state . Moreover , says would provide another segmented regulatory structure limits national global growth companies operating space.If place world could largest negative effect would California.FloridaFlorida House Bill 1379 recently passed , clarifying virtual currency prohibiting use laundering criminal proceeds . The term “ virtual currency ” added definition “ monetary instruments ” Florida ’ Money Laundering Act . The legislation currently Florida ’ governor expected signed soon . Ever since Miami judge dismissed criminal case involving Bitcoin , policymakers intent establishing guidelines curb cryptocurrency use.Says Kuskowski : “ In relation ’ going Florida , lot regulators , especially local ones , tend crowd profiled earlier catches headlines , go bit far . But needs balanced approach side well . People need realize clear regulatory environment allows companies creators space make concrete strategic decisions [ otherwise ] ’ regulatory environment ’ clear ; done properly . Once clear regulation place , businesses confidence make certain strategic decisions grow. ” Palestinian officials planning region Palestine receive digital currency within next five years . The motivation stems concerns potential Israeli interference , Azzam Shawwa , Governor Palestinian Monetary Authority ( PMA ) , told news agency Reuters.Palestinians sovereign currency use combination different currencies , including euro , dollar , Jordanian dinar Israeli shekel , conduct daily financial transactions.Due lack sovereign currency , Palestinian officials little control money supply inflation . This Palestinian Monetary Authority wants introduce bitcoin-like digital currency territory 's new legal tender , called “ Palestinian Pound , ” according Shawwa.It Palestinian Monetary Authority 's goal become fully-fledged internationally recognized central bank independent Palestine . However , still unclear digital sovereign currency Palestinians would sit 1994 Paris Protocol agreement . The protocol agreement gives Palestinian Monetary Authority functions central bank ; however , granted institutions right issue currency . The Paris protocol recommends use shekel region , thereby , effectively provides Israel veto establishment Palestinian currency.A sovereign digital currency , though , would make sense Palestine . Not would allow PMA control country ’ money supply inflation , would also circumvent practical challenges delivering hard currency country PMA money-printing facilities . `` If print currency , get country would always need clearance Israelis could obstacle . So n't want go , '' Shawwa explained Reuters . While digital Palestinian pound planned issued within next five years , easy task Palestinian authorities , given Palestinian Monetary Authority trying decade become internationally recognized central bank.Another option Palestinian monetary situation would keep current status quo four above-mentioned currencies use officially recognize one currencies territory ’ legal tender . However , digital sovereign currency would preferred choice Palestine , according Shawwa.The blockchain industry booming Australia recently Australian Tax Office ( ATO ) announced changes tax laws 2017–2018 budget summary Australian government , surrounding digital currencies treated country .

He explained subcommittee revolutionary role blockchain technology playing world around us . “ Just PC democratized computing , web democratized news entertainment , open blockchain networks democratizing financial services. ” Van Valkenburgh , however , drew stark contrast regulatory safe harbors given early internet innovators , specifically Communications Decency Act Digital Millennium Copyright Act , little done protect blockchain technology innovators today. “ Both laws created safe harbors infrastructure-building businesses , ” noted Van Valkenburgh . The laws protected creators internet ’ infrastructure third-party liability stemming users infrastructure.In conversation Bitcoin Magazine , Van Valkenburgh gave example Google . Google ’ liable user illegally downloads pirated material website whose link popped search engine . This aforementioned Digital Millennium Copyright Act , provided safe harbor allowed Google continue build infrastructure internet ( case , search engine ) free crushing copyright liabilities.A similar distinction drawn comes regulating innovators blockchain technology , Van Valkenburgh noted conversation . There two main entities innovating space : custodians hold valuable digital assets consumers , developers building infrastructure blockchain technology , ’ hold consumer funds . “ These different entities , ” said Van Valkenburgh , “ regulated different ways. ” An example “ custodian ” would Coinbase , regularly holds consumer ’ bitcoin , ether digital assets . An infrastructure developer would like software wallet developer , simply creates tool consumer interact blockchain , safekeep digital assets send transactions . The wallet developers ’ exercise control users ’ digital assets.The infrastructure developers , Van Valkenburgh points , regulated money transmitters must get licensed state state starting business . Their role create portals pipelines transactions flow , direct control transactions . If developer found misleading consumer his/her software product , ex-post-regulatory punishment may appropriate , , permission process precedes developers ’ endeavors.When comes custodial financial services , much regulation , therefore protection innovators , state level . This makes complicated innovators based U.S. plethora different regulators space . Each regulator ability affect innovator blockchain technology operates.Van Valkenburgh said statement subcommittee , “ In order reestablish U.S. leader need rationalize chaos financial services regulation , starting state-by-state money transmission licensing. ” These custodial services , ones holding consumer ’ value , regulated , argues Van Valkenburgh , repeat licensing process 50 times . Because costly barrier entry , someone innovating space today would best-advised leave U.S. start business country simpler regulatory structures . We must regulate federal level want simpler licensing process.Bitcoin Terrorist FinancingOn day , Jerry Brito , executive director Coin Center , joined panel discuss United States House Representatives Subcommittee Terrorism Illicit Finance national security implications financial innovations.Brito explained subcommittee , “ [ Bitcoin ] open bad actors take advantage . Criminals certainly use today , begun see nascent interest terrorist groups . According recent report potential terrorist use digital currencies Center New American Security , however , ‘ Currently anecdotal evidence terrorist groups used virtual currencies support themselves. ’ ” Brito views infancy interest bad groups opportunity get front problem . “ This means time develop appropriate response possibility ; reasoned response targets threat preserving freedom innovate. ” The main take-home message meeting , however , , Van Valkenburgh explained conversation Bitcoin Magazine , ’ actually appear much use digital currency funding terrorism . In fact , bit unwieldy terrorists use public nature distributed ledger . However , ’ stop U.S. developing solutions curb use digital currencies terrorists.What Coin Center wanted subcommittees understand , end day , digital currency stay . It destroyed . The technology neither bad good , instead new tool disposal anyone computer . To ignore technology allow countries take lead adopting incorporating , gaining benefits process.Beginning process effectively sensibly regulating digital currency must government wants derive benefits existence prevalence.Known Silver State , Nevada long established reputation relaxed laws pertaining legalized gambling , corporate asset protection business privacy . Now , move certain closely watched U.S. states , Nevada Senate Bill 398 recently signed Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval , officially passed law state ’ Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.The bill introduced sponsored Republican Senator Ben Kieckhefer . After amended twice , legislation passed vote 41 0.This landmark bill provides guidelines related use blockchain technology . Nevada thus becomes first U.S. state approve legislation blocking local government entities taxing , licensing imposing requirements blockchain use . According Senate Committee Judiciary record document , Kieckhefer states , “ Local governments impose taxes , fees requirements relating use blockchain smart contracts. ” He goes note bill help Nevada keep pace technological advancements , providing “ legal framework people using blockchain legal gray area. ” Said Kieckhefer : “ Senate Bill 398 offshoot several efforts I worked 2015-2016 Interim ensure Nevada environment welcoming inclusive startups . Entrepreneurs working package legislation ensure , instead incentivizing large companies relocate State , policies incentivizing smaller companies start grow here. ” The bill clarified definition blockchain technology , espousing “ electronic record created use decentralized method multiple parties verify store digital record transactions secured use cryptographic hash previous transaction information. ” Smart contracts also defined electronic record , verified use blockchain : “ A smart contract , record signature may denied legal effect enforceability solely blockchain used create , store verify smart contract , record signature. ” Most notably , electronic signatures recorded blockchain protected : “ If law requires signature , submission blockchain electronically contains signature verifies intent person provide signature satisfies law , ” per bill ’ decree.Two U.S. states taken similar steps recognize blockchains appropriate data store , seven total codifying legislation pertaining blockchains.A number U.S. states recognized , process recognizing , blockchains appropriate data store . The similar bill neighboring state Arizona , passed House Bill 2417 law toward end March . Unlike Nevada ’ , however , bill falls short providing restrictions taxes licensing.A number Nevada-based business leaders offered strong support testimony bill , including Allison Clift-Jennings , founder Filament , Reno-based firm fostering application IoT blockchain technology industrial use . `` Having Nevada pass legislation puts state advantage , clearly succinctly outlines much state , state , comes blockchain regulation , ” Clift-Jennings said Bitcoin Magazine. “ With technology powerful new , ’ important established companies startups alike know jurisdiction treat new technology . We ’ happy turned , appreciate Senator Kieckhefer Clift & Co. efforts getting passed unanimously Assembly Senate . `` Jaron Lukasiewicz , vice-president Las Vegas-based construction consultancy Rhodes Corporation advisor SONM ( decentralized supercomputing network ) told Bitcoin Magazine ’ “ fantastic ” see Nevada taking initiative providing welcoming environment blockchain businesses state . “ Nevada ’ actions help attract entrepreneurs growing industry state , hopefully promoting high concentration blockchain talent here. ” Lukasiewicz believes easy governments develop negative bias toward bitcoin cryptocurrencies variety reasons . He says blockchain technology , however , seems moving different direction . “ Most regulators every level government appear understand importance blockchain technology working create environment attract startups space. ” Project TITANIUM : The EU ’ Plan Decloak CryptocurrencyMonitor blockchains , deanonymize wallet addresses , surveil dark net markets , stop terrorists money launderers : ’ main thrust European Union ’ Project TITANIUM.TITANIUM , stands Tools Investigation Transactions Underground Markets , three-year , €5 million ( $ 5.5 million ) project unite universities , private research firms law enforcement agencies U.K. , Germany , Spain , Austria , Netherlands Finland.Project TITANIUM develop tools best practices criminal investigations involving cryptocurrency Europe , , , law enforcement agencies pursued ad-hoc basis.The project plans create forensic tools spot clusters addresses controlled entity ; identify mixers tumbler addresses used money laundering ; crawl webs , clear dark ; automate information gathering illegal activities.The project ’ coordinator , Dr. Ross King Austrian Institute Technology , said criminal terrorist uses cryptocurrencies dark net markets “ evolve quickly. ” King also insisted Project TITANIUM would respect “ citizen privacy. ” Project TITANIUM ’ announcement comes weeks ransomware worm WannaCry disabled hundreds thousands computers 150 countries . As June 15 , 2017 , hardcoded wallet addresses used attackers collected 50 BTC ransom payments.The project ’ scope covers terrorism , well crime , back-to-back attacks Manchester London ignited calls sweeping government action combat extremism.On June 4 , 2017 , Prime Minister Theresa May called “ international agreements regulate cyberspace ” deny violent extremists “ safe spaces ” online . With terrorism background , cooperation internal security matters like Project TITANIUM likely continue even U.K. formally exits EU.The call surveillance comes despite fact United Kingdom already one wide-ranging surveillance laws , Investigatory Powers Act , went force December 30 , 2016.Nicknamed Snooper ’ Charter , act requires ISPs keep record websites users visit one year allows police public agencies check anyone ’ history without warrant.Meanwhile , EU mulling direct approach problem cryptocurrency . According proposed directive released March 9 , 2017 , EU could require exchanges wallet providers submit account owners ’ identities central database.The directive goes “ virtual currencies anonymous , ” anonymity pseudo-anonymity cryptocurrencies “ hindrance asset ” legitimate users.The rules would apply bitcoin , “ virtual currencies , ” would effectively ban anonymous cryptocurrency , least EU . The proposed directive intended combat money laundering terrorism , despite scant evidence cryptocurrencies play prominent role either.Nevertheless , without evidence empowering terrorists , anonymous pseudo-anonymous nature cryptocurrencies threatening European lawmakers , whether legislation projects like TITANIUM , intend decloak cryptocurrency.The United States Senate introduced bill would require travelers entering U.S. declare digital currency holdings excess $ 10,000 . Despite concerns raised invasive nature bill , likelihood passed extremely low simply due incredibly challenging infrastructure would required.In fact , new bill actually reintroduction older bill originally introduced 2011 . The 2011 bill never made sub-committee deliberation.Speaking recent legislation development , David Siegel , founder Twenty Thirty AG Bitcoin enthusiast , tells Bitcoin Magazine , “ It ’ disappointing . It ’ step back toward 1934. ” The bill would require Secretary Homeland Secretary U.S. Customs Border Protection Commissioner submit joint report Congress withinthat meets following two conditions 18 months date enactment Act : “ ( 1 ) detailing strategy interdict detect prepaid access devices , digital currencies , similar instruments , border crossings ports entry United States ; ; ( 2 ) includes assessment infrastructure needed carry strategy ... ” The amount technology would developed order enforce law incredible . How could detect crypto assets ? The infrastructure investment would needed would quite prodigious. “ My position regulation strong evidence supporting effectiveness , ” says Siegel . “ I ’ see declaring moving money transparency issue , I would say ’ strong step wrong direction . I think regulation scaled way back point show ’ actually better regulation. ” The bill , S.1241 , would add “ prepaid access devices ” definition U.S. monetary instruments section 5312 , title 31 , U.S. Code . Specifically , “ ‘ prepaid access device ’ means electronic device vehicle , card , plate , code , number , electronic serial number , mobile identification number , personal identification number , instrument , provides portal funds value funds paid advance retrievable transferable point future. ” These prepaid access devices , theory , could extend include electronic ledgers , cryptocurrency wallets even private keys . These portals individuals gain access private funds . Thus , individuals $ 10,000 worth crypto assets tied blockchain would declare crypto net worth U.S. Government filling Report International Transportation Currency Monetary Instruments , often called FinCEN105 . This could serious impact digital currency holders traveling United States . Punishment reporting could include five years jail time forfeiture funds form criminal civilian penalties.Formally known “ Combating Money Laundering , Terrorist Financing , Counterfeiting Act 2017 , ” bill introduced May 25 , 2017 , Senator Chuck Grassley ( R-IA ) co-sponsored Senators Dianne Feinstein ( D-CA ) , John Cornyn ( R-TX ) Sheldon Whitehouse ( D-RI ) . It referred Committee Judiciary deliberation , tremendous number obstacles must overcome reaching President ’ desk final approval.Theo Chino , bitcoin advocate fighting regulations U.S. two years , requested withdrawal proposed “ Uniform Regulation Virtual Currency Businesses Act. ” Only July 7 , 2017 , Chino asked Uniform Law Commission ( ULC ) withdraw proposed regulation cryptocurrencies United States . The bitcoin advocate submitted letter ULC asking abandon proposed statute . Chino argued many states “ significant disagreements approaches classify regulate bitcoin. ” In addition , high level legal uncertainty surrounding proposed statute due legal challenge New York BitLicense — also known Virtual Currency Regulation — New York courts.The legal challenge , Chino cited letter ULC , lawsuit initiated New York State Department Financial Services ( “ NYDFS ” ) . In October 2015 , Chino started action NYDFS regarding BitLicense arguing agency “ exceeded regulatory mandate , regulating Bitcoin lies legislature , NYDFS. ” “ This proposed model statute , inspired New York BitLicense , make impossible small Bitcoin business survive , also discourage public use Bitcoin . One look far understand Bitcoin ’ adoption low poor . This kind arbitrary negative intervention must stop , ” said Chino.In post Reddit , Chino stated spoke twice chair Virtual Currency Committee . The chair committee told Chino take case legal level disagrees proposed statute. “ This last conversation led believe [ chair committee ] care academic search true nature Bitcoin interested personal notoriety chair committee . He really know technology really worked act bad , ” Chino wrote Reddit. “ He admit represented industry individual small business. ” CoinbaseCoinbase , digital currency exchange complying New York BitLicense , currently investigation Internal Revenue Service . However , week reported IRS scaling back investigation . The IRS seeking information Coinbase users engaged transactions $ 20,000 . This means agency exempt users buy , sell , send receive `` least equivalent $ 20,000 one transaction type one year 2013-15 period . `` Bobby Lee Need RegulationEarlier year , People ’ Bank China ( PBOC ) halted withdrawals bitcoin Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges , also affected Bobby Lee ’ company , BTCC . In attempt regulate market , PBOC created task force inspecting trade digital currencies . The goal task force ensure cryptocurrency exchanges implemented anti-money laundering systems . In month , PBOC announced met nine virtual currency exchanges warn consequences violating rules.This move PBOC perceived attempt crack bitcoin trade , Bobby Lee , CEO Chinese bitcoin exchange BTCC , seem share view.In contrast coming U.S. , Lee said CNBC interview week cryptocurrencies need regulations . According , regulations , digital currencies suffer high volatility . `` It 's really crackdown , '' Lee said . `` The central bank previously aware details bitcoin utilized , bitcoin traded . `` However , Lee added essential regulators take time come “ appropriate rules laws govern companies , business , govern individuals [ ] people conduct business online. ” '' I think regulation much needed new asset class otherwise 'll run amok society . But challenge craft rules around new technology. ” It matter time U.S. Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) moved “ Wild West ” world Initial Coin Offerings ( ICOs ) , sent blockchain world reeling . Yesterday , finally announcement virtual tokens like ones sold DAO securities subject federal securities laws.The SEC statements reads part : “ federal securities laws apply offer sell securities United States , regardless whether issuing entity traditional company decentralized autonomous organization , regardless whether securities purchased using U.S. dollars virtual currencies , regardless whether distributed certificated form distributed ledger technology. ” The SEC cautioning investors aware risks also ensure looking get involved due diligence well.One important distinction seems emerged report , however , DAO tokens securities , Ether still clear.The Report seems distinguish Ether , labeled virtual currency , DAO Tokens , labeled security . Market participants may take comfort distinction , supports view blockchain tokens securities U.S. Federal Securities Laws . - Devebois & Plimpton LLCThe announcement , nevertheless , expected impact token sales . As result recent development , important note company looking raise capital ICOs U.S. take SEC decision consideration.On legal side , Louis Lehot DLA Piper told Bitcoin Magazine : “ Those considering token offering would well served reconsider plans ensure compliance areas , tip tail. ” Lehot said : “ The SEC ’ release notable survey many corollary issues triggered federal securities laws token deemed security , registration exemption , whether general solicitation permissible , crowdfunding , after-market trading even addressed compliance issues 1940 Act. ” What Is “ The Howey Test ” ?

It come surprise SEC found buyers DAO Token purchased security. ” He explained key feature DAO token indeed expectation profit investments made DAO successful , DAO tokens expressly sold investment . Lukasiewicz added : “ Unlike token Ether , DAO token utility . Many people industry time concerned DAO reasons stated SEC. ” Marco Santori , partner Cooley LLP legal ambassador Delaware Blockchain Initiative , shared excellent summary report 's key points Twitter , touching chiefly distinction tokens securities . Arnold Spencer acts general counsel Coinsource network Bitcoin ATMs . He summed distinction succinct analogy : If buy interest golf course make money business , financial investment therefore security . If join golf club play golf , financial investment security.Important — Not SurprisingRon Chernesky , CEO social trading platform investFeed , said welcomes SEC announcement , although also noted “ yesterday ’ announcement , common knowledge ICOs enveloped regulatory [ gray ] area. ” It would appear gray area shrunk somewhat.Lost headlines SEC ’ recent pronouncements cryptocurrency important practical advice promoters participants initial coin offerings ( ICOs ) .Most coverage rightfully garnered Report SEC ’ enforcement division deemed DAO Tokens securities , subjecting offering Howey test . However , simultaneously issued Investor Bulletin also closely read issuers ICOs counsel.Advice Issuers CounselEven though bulletin prepared cautionary statement investors , contains least one disclaimer ( boldface type ) attorneys advising ICOs add following language offering document white paper : Investing ICO may limit recovery event fraud theft . While may rights federal securities laws , ability recover may significantly limited.We previously discussed importance disclaimers risk factors . By discussing vulnerabilities cryptocurrency exchanges potential difficulties associated recovery invested stolen funds , SEC signals least risk factors counsel consider adding ICO offering materials . In fact , prudent attorneys advising ICO clients would wise employ cut-and-paste function , adding caveat documents.This additional wording significant spells three key characteristics ICOs : ( ) difficulty tracing securing virtual currency ; ( ii ) international scope ICOs ; ( iii ) fact lack central authority may limit investor ’ remedies issuer.Practical Advice InvestorsBesides usual bromides wary offer sounds “ good true , ” SEC demonstrated appreciation unique due diligence required carefully evaluating ICO.According bulletin , investors “ ask whether blockchain open public , whether code published , whether independent cybersecurity audit. ” The SEC communicating factors indicative companies whose products verifiably real secure.Given importance SEC placed three items , rather await questions , points clearly addressed issuer ICO materials distributed potential investors . Issuers ICOs include factors “ good facts ” help demonstrate product ’ value , security legitimacy.While recent flurry documents emanating SEC likely given issuers ICOs counsel pause ( caused walk token Howey test ) , appear stifled transactions.However , report reiterates conceptual framework potential token offering evaluated determine whether constitutes securities offering , bulletin provides practical advice , investors expect see SEC ’ language repeated ICO offering documents going forward.The Russian real estate firm Kalinka Group announced clients selling luxurious home bitcoins . The 4200 square foot country mansion located village Nikolino , situated fashionable neighborhood Rublevo-Upenskoe highway . According Kalinka Group , first time history Russian real estate market client offered sell property cryptocurrencies . `` Such transactions still novelty , even world real estate markets , ” Ekaterina Rumyantseva , chairman board Kalinka Group , said statement . “ We pleased pioneers open new frontiers business. ” She pointed Russian legislation yet defined rules working bitcoins , far legal definition cryptocurrency .

Last week released guidance document explains approach token sales/ICOs/ITOs/crowdsales , officially titled “ CSA Staff Notice 46-307 : Cryptocurrency Offerings. ” Here notice means ’ mean.In press release accompanied Staff Notice , Louis Morisset , chair Canadian Securities Administrators ( CSA ) head Quebec securities regulator , quoted saying : “ The technology behind cryptocurrency offerings potential generate new capital-raising opportunities businesses welcome type innovation … ” The press release recommends Staff Notice anyone “ … planning raise capital ICO ITO , seeking establish cryptocurrency investment fund. ” The global legal backdrop Staff Notice 46-307 increased regulatory scrutiny token offerings , including U.S. Securities Exchange Commission report “ The DAO ” issued last month Monetary Authority Singapore ’ issuance regulatory position.Before diving Staff Notice says , ’ important understand Staff Notice . The author Staff Notice CSA , association provincial territorial securities regulators . Regulation securities conducted provincial basis done country-wide level like jurisdictions . The CSA national forum harmonizing securities rules Staff Notice essentially joint position Canada ’ many securities regulators view ICOs.The Staff Notice interesting legal change . It create new rules Canada provide clarity anyone seeking understand Canadian securities law applies token sales . Here ten key takeaways CSA Staff Notice:1 . Regulators treat token using case-by-case approachA widespread fear blockchain industry regulators somehow “ shut ” token sales . The Staff Notice assuages fear : “ Every ICO/ITO unique must assessed characteristics . For example , individual purchases coins/tokens allow him/her play video games platform , possible securities may involved . However , individual purchases coins/tokens whose value tied future profits success business , likely considered securities. ” This great paragraph see . The regulators communicating lawyer working area would confirmed client : Some tokens securities ’ . This means regulators ’ interested knee-jerk response paints token sales broad brush.2 . Substance trump form comes ICOsA security security words used . The Staff Notice includes warning effect : “ Staff aware businesses marketing coins/tokens software products , taking position coins/tokens subject securities laws . However , many cases , totality offering arrangement considered , coins/tokens properly considered securities . In assessing whether securities laws apply , consider substance form. ” An illegal securities offering ’ dressed make legal product . A high-level staffer Ontario Securities Commission quoted Globe Mail day Staff Notice issued : “ So ’ trying raise awareness ’ called something coin token ’ mean ’ loophole go promise investors great returns , provide sort documentation ensure ’ selling actually suitable them. ” 3 . The CSA thinks many ICOs securities offerings aimed retail investorsProducts purchased . Capital invested . When store sells good , ’ consider sale “ investment. ” Yet world ICOs filled references token investors rather token buyers . Many people speak “ raising capital ” sell token , resisting characterization transaction sale securities . As Staff Notice points : “ ICOs/ITOs generally used start-up businesses raise capital investors internet . These investors often retail investors. ” Many ICOs done order “ raise capital , ” rather create revenue sale products , securities regulators taken notice . The reference “ retail investors ” acknowledges activity taking place individual level rather institutional , large corporate fund investments . This paragraph indicates CSA may view ICOs/ITOs securities offerings.4 . The existing legal framework securities applied : Pacific CoinA critical case Canadian securities law 1978 Supreme Court decision Pacific Coast Coin Exchange v. Ontario Securities Commission . This leading case “ security ” Canada ’ explicitly mentioned Staff Notice . The case lays following test : “ 1 . An investment money 2 . In common enterprise 3 . With expectation profit 4 . To come significantly efforts others. ” This test similar Howey test United States . Note ’ “ test ” way people would understand word . A legal test framework decision-making requires understanding facts , circumstances recent cases . Consultation lawyer necessary order understand test applies given situation — even may clear.Essentially , section Staff Notice shows ’ planning unique approach ICOs . Token sales integrated existing legal rules securities.5 . The Regulated System ( white papers ’ sufficient disclosure Canadian securities law ) If token security , ’ necessarily mean ’ sold . It mean ’ sold many rules follow . The CSA helpfully explains system Canada selling token-securities high-level : “ To date , business used prospectus complete ICO/ITO Canada . We anticipate businesses looking sell coins/tokens may prospectus exemptions . Sales may made investors qualify ‘ accredited investors ’ defined securities laws , reliance accredited investor prospectus exemption . For retail investors qualify accredited investors , sales typically need made reliance offering memorandum ( OM ) prospectus exemption. ” The section followed note “ white papers ” sufficient disclosure meet Canadian securities rules.6 . There civil well regulatory consequences non-complianceWhat happens Canadian securities rules ’ followed ? The CSA reminds people beyond regulatory penalties may civil penalties : “ It also noted investors may also civil remedies persons companies fail comply securities laws , including right withdraw transaction and/or damages losses grounds transactions conducted breach securities laws. ” The warning applies securities-related penalties/remedies . There may also civil causes action generated improper sale . Canadian law many opportunities buyers sue sellers tricking properly explaining selling.7 . Cryptocurrency investment funds ought follow rules funds tooOne explicit audiences Staff Notice people running considering running cryptocurrency investment funds . Pages 5-6 excellent information legal compliance steps properly running crypto fund Canada.8 . Some token sales securities offerings , token-securities also derivativesSecurities also derivatives may additional rules apply . The CSA notes might two sets rules follow : “ We note products may also derivatives subject derivatives laws adopted Canadian securities regulatory authorities , including trade reporting rules. ” 9 . Resale restrictions need considered tokens securitiesThere paragraph Staff Notice could easily overlooked contains useful tip anyone designing token systems : “ Allowing coins/tokens securities issued part ICO/ITO trade cryptocurrency exchanges may also place business issuing coins/tokens offside securities laws . For example , resale coins/tokens securities subject restrictions secondary trading. ” This paragraph challenge lawyers working ICOs may securities . They consider rules apply securities enforced system deployed . How resale restrictions imposed securities laws reflected technical system ? Will end new ERC standard regulated tokens ’ permit transfer ? Or locks token period time ? A token ’ include legal rules technical rules could end creating legal trouble proponents.10 . The regulatory focus shifted crypto investment risks tokens securitiesIn 2014 , securities regulators ( specifically , Ontario Securities Commission ) viewed digital currencies lens transactions speculation : “ Virtual ( digital ) currencies like Bitcoin used type money offer novel way make purchases transact business online . However , remains unclear virtual currency truly represents . Is actually money ? An investment ? Something else ? This still largely uncharted unsupervised area , protections likely available become involved virtual currency something goes wrong. ” The Staff Notice shift thinking , away “ buyer beware ” stance held recognition blockchain development rapidly moving beyond payments many areas economy.In July , U.S. Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) moved `` Wild West '' world ICOs , sent blockchain world reeling . Now , Israel Securities Authority ( ISA ) announced plans form panel regulate Initial Coin Offerings ( ICOs ) .This week , ISA announced chairman , Prof. Shmuel Hauser , put together committee examine regulation ICOs . The committee investigate applicability securities regulations ICOs based shared ledgers offered Israeli public.On July 31 , Israeli Bitcoin Association ( IBA ) made official public statement topic ICOs . The IBA cautioned potential ICO participants ’ important understand huge risks exist investing ICOs.This new world tends captivate innocents tempted hope getting rich quick . We implore public considering investment ICOs treat matter serious consideration , recognition investors might lose money.Regarding regulation , Association cautioned “ regulatory attitude towards area yet clarified . On one hand , means investors find difficult demand rights , due lack appropriate infrastructure . On hand , possible future regulatory intervention specific project whole domain , may hurt continued operation. ” It seems time “ future ” defined regulation works.Udi Wertheimer , Israeli blockchain researcher , read latest announcement ISA original Hebrew provided Bitcoin Magazine translation document. “ The announcement neutral tone , ” Wertheimer told Bitcoin Magazine , “ pointing ISA interested encouraging new investment funding options , wish stifle new innovations , time acknowledging ICOs turned scams others involved market manipulation , yet others ended hacked various ways , leading investor funds lost. ” The document lays rationale follows : While considering ISA ’ policy last year developing innovative funding models parallel keeping interests investors warning unregulated investments , seems ’ growing need regulation field ICOs . The committee ’ job include investigating activity applicability Israeli law exists today may adjusted , reviewing legal status countries. “ This first time I know Israeli authorities referred ICOs directly . Israel home many ICOs , like Bancor , Kik ’ Kin , Stox , CoinDash others , ” said Wertheimer.He noted ISA recently cracked “ binary options ” companies , tried subvert security laws eventually identified illegal . Even though companies registered elsewhere , ISA forced shut operations Israel abroad . Wertheimer told Bitcoin Magazine : “ Personally , I hope regulators keep hands-off approach near future , I ’ still hoping field still find way self-regulate . However , given massive PR push ICOs Israel internationally , I ’ surprised ISA decided take close look. ” Meni Rosenfeld Israeli Bitcoin Association told Bitcoin Magazine Association yet formulated stance ISA ’ investigation.Last week , U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approved gene drug Kymriah certain types cancer . However , Kymriah costs $ 475,000 one single treatment , Bloomberg reports , well beyond affordable average patients.In U.S. , FDA approval process adds billions dollars drug development costs , pharmaceutical companies must recover , also adds years drug availability timeline . The impression suffering U.S. patients required pay exorbitant drug prices support over-regulation difficult escape.To operate beyond reach FDA regulations , Peter Thiel libertarian investors funding offshore human clinical trial herpes vaccine , TechCrunch reports . Thiel ’ move caused stormy debate clashes opposite positions . See , example , opposite takes DailyBeast Reason.There many examples harmful effects over-regulation health sector , matters life death serious used political point . However , sectors illustrate ethical economical problems over-regulation.Take , example , internet gambling , illegal many jurisdictions including U.S.It ’ worth noting internet gambling hugely popular , sector moves lot money . The ethical objection making internet gambling illegal easy formulate : The adult citizens want gamble money online free so.The economical objection also easy formulate : Adult citizens want gamble money online find ways , using offshore service providers ’ none home going Tor VPN needed . But , online gambling providers forced move offshore , 'll take lot jobs lot money them.This exactly happened online gambling sector , many U.S. providers migrating gambling-friendly jurisdictions U.K . Similarly , Isle Man government recognized internet gambling potential strategic growth sector established suitable legal fiscal framework attract online gambling sports betting businesses . As result , leading operators flocked island.Since U.S. residents want gamble online anyway , effect over-regulating industry take money , jobs technology offshore.Actually , entirely correct : Besides moving offshore , less scrupulous operators also option moving underground . In case , would force want engage totally harmless gambling deal shady even criminal underworld , dangerous . This point , seems perfectly logical , often made support drug liberalization.Crypto Innovation Takes Path Least ResistanceAfter introduced light relatively permissive regulations attract internet gambling operators , Isle Man adopted strategy cryptocurrencies digital fintech . Switzerland following path , “ Crypto Valley ” near Zug attracting crypto-fintech operators.Initial Coin Offerings ( ICOs ) token sales relatively new crypto-fintech phenomenon attracting lots attention press , old new businesses , regulators.In July , U.S. Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) issued first ruling outlined tokens considered securities subjected rather strict SEC regulations . Other regulatory authorities , Canadian Securities Administrators , considering plans follow suit.On Monday , People ’ Bank China ( PBoC ) Chinese regulatory bodies banned deemed illegal practice raising funds crypto-token ICOs , reported Reuters . This seems conflict recent , much reasonable statements Director PBoC ’ Digital Currency Research Institute , could indicate internal disagreement.The regulators mainly concerned protecting gullible citizens scams , inevitably common ICO scene . Perhaps Chinese regulators temporarily freezing ICOs chance put sound regulatory framework place . But argued , intention truly ban ICOs outright , regulators overreacting ways deny useful options businesses citizens alike.According SEC CSA , tokens underlying utility rather speculative investment value alone escape considered securities . But , always , devil details . If token really useful , market value go , speculative investors profit . The question comes mind , point useful token become speculative investment ? According specialized lawyers , “ SEC provided clear answer. ” “ Obviously everything appreciates value security , ” notes crypto investor CEO 21.co , Balaji Srinivasan , insightful CNBC interview . “ For example , house appreciate value , ( many people ) buy use value. ” But regulators could tempted follow China ’ lead consider useful tokens securities , seems dangerous overkill.The SEC regulations restrict investing privately offered securities “ accredited investors. ” But less 10 percent households U.S. wealthy enough qualify , strict requirements well.Therefore , useful tokens considered securities , ability creators value raise funds significantly hampered , average citizens denied opportunity bet innovative projects could offer significant returns.It ’ expected Chinese crypto-token initiatives , including scams really innovative promising projects , move offshore take jobs money . Similarly , U.S. crypto regulations become restrictive , many U.S. companies could tempted follow example Xapo relocate Switzerland . Last week , blockchain company ShapeShift announced decision leave State Washington due local over-regulation.Srinivasan ’ well-argued thesis crypto-tokens democratize investment , open new fundraising options businesses new investment options public — including small businesses average citizens — turn internet world 's largest “ stock ” market. “ The regulatory framework likely eventually accommodate , ” concludes Srinivasan . “ Only countries need allow , consequent creation wealth large 'll push many rest liberal tokenization regime well. ” The regulators take wise advice account formulating reasonable policies crypto-token sector , well sectors mentioned above.The crypto market , especially China , panic past days , largely official notice Preventing Risks Fundraising Through Coin Offering , jointly issued People ’ Bank China ( PBOC ) , Cyberspace Administration China , Ministry Industry Information Technology , State Administration Industry Commerce , China Banking Regulatory Commission , China Securities Commission China Insurance Regulatory Commission.There seems general fear China ’ attack Initial Coin Offerings ( ICOs ) tokens , often used fund blockchain innovation open investment blockchain technology masses , stifle blockchain development industry whole one world ’ largest markets.At first glance , harshness statement seems comparable Chinese government ’ 2013 warning made bitcoin prices plummet immediately . However , West suspect China stifling Chinese innovation underestimating political wisdom Chinese government . Meanwhile , East critcizing China ’ ICO policy harsh government moves protect interests private investors ignoring Chinese government ’ history decisiveness tackling “ illegal public funding ” recent decades.Western critics think China ’ economic development gains past decades since policy openness initiated 1978 ; context , government ’ latest statment read underlying message . Eastern critics understand Chinese government zero tolerance activities jeopardize financial stability.The second-largest economy world managed weather financial crises 1997 2008 : This simply chance . China ’ economy innovative ambitious . Since blockchain technology acknowledged next-generation technological powerhouse , potential reshape way value exchanged , reason China anything harm blockchain innovation . China cracking blockchain technology : It actually poised lead blockchain development country , also around world.Breaking Down LanguageFirst , though original text subtle , crucial note PBOC ’ statement September 4 targets illegal ICOs instead targeting blockchain companies whole . The translation original text : “ No organizations individuals shall conduct illegal token financing activities ( ICO ) . ” The underlying interpretation illegal ICOs , also legal ICOs ( “ token financing atctivities ” ) , requires introduction new regulations.Besides avoiding use word “ blockchain ” , statement also reveals another subtlety : It uses term “ virtual currencies ” refer ICO tokens . This word choice particularly telling . In past , People ’ Daily , party-run newspaper , described bitcoin “ digital gold ” ― instance , article published May ― used term “ digital currency. ” It important interpret Chinese language , especially specific word choices made official sources , carefully . By choosing use word “ virtual , ” word implying “ unreal ” “ insubstantial ” Chinese , legitimacy ICO tokens already undermined.Second , happened Chinese crypto market past months impacted government ’ bottom line : Its financial stability threatened . Although many Westerners crypto space familiar Chinese projects like NEO Qtum , Chinese crypto market actually witnessed recent advent 65 ICO projects , around $ 400 million raised , according report issued National Committee Experts Internet Financial Security Technology . The absolute number enormous , key projects unreliable even fraudulent , open-source codes sometimes without white paper . Some projects even provide huge discounts pre-ICO investors ― thereby dooming joined official ICO lose money , even building hopes 10x returns . It sort irresponsible behavior compelled government step anything extreme happened.Furthermore , financial activities involving financing public particularly suspect eyes Chinese government . Wu Ying , China ’ successful businesswoman , sentenced life prison 2014 “ illegal funding public. ” Also , E Zubao , country ’ biggest online lender , condemned Chinese authorities Ponzi scheme company found squandered money raised public ( used match investors potential borrowers ) . The losses considerable : Around $ 7.6 billion involved E Zubao case , instance.Past transgressions like chiefly blame China ’ current suspicion ICOs . It perhaps surprise , words , government declaring ICOs illegal , requiring return tokens investors . China characteristically cautious regarding anything posing potential risks financial stability.Third , China still encourages innovation within blockchain industry , needs regulated crypto market . It may regulate ICOs , exchanges , information disclosure channels . But reason behind regulation stems need create sound environment blockchain development China.According China ’ Premier Li Qeqiang last year ― government ’ 13th Five-Year Plan Economic Social Development ― blockchain technology listed important area development Chinese endeavors . This overtly positive support blockchain technology changed easily . Other evidence official support blockchain technology abounds . For instance , news program CCTV stated China pausing ICOs , banning outright . And news section official site Chinese government also reposted article stating “ China potentially become leader blockchain industry. ” ( See image . ) These subtle signals China preparing better blockchain world.In blockchain session Global Digital Marketing Summit , held Guiyang government western China July year , government also mentioned “ sandbox mechanism ” become important step investors invest projects without worrying policy risk ( sandbox allow open space qualified projects promoted financed ) . ICOs among first experiments blockchain industry explore business financing models . It normal new industry encumbent business model find conflict existing laws given country point . To make corrections embrace compliance guidelines harm industry long run.China ’ attitude toward blockchains ICOs impact global token price actually affirmed importance China ’ role industry . Its recent policy attempt maintain financial stability set tone future industry China.Fears China confine even kill blockchain industry tenable . Furthermore , China large solid foundation internet mobile device users , world-class level infrastructure . If blockchain industry really potential improve human commerce civilization , China ’ market serve best test case.Even end , new policy makes harder blockchain projects financed China , one considers internet giants like Alibaba , Tencent Jingdong based businesses China found financing mainly outside country , really need worry development blockchain China ― let alone rest world . China clamping cryptocurrency , much clear . But developing story dominates headlines , notable trend lack official information . Chinese officials seem systematically decline requests comments , local sources willing provide information condition anonymity , leaked documents remain unverified.Despite lack clarity , ’ ’ known far.Effects TradingThe important thing know sure Chinese bitcoin exchanges closing , least exiting China.BTCC — oldest bitcoin exchange world — first exchange announce ’ closing shop within Asian country , end month . The exchange cited guidelines published Chinese central bank ( People ’ Bank China ; PBOC ) , initially appeared affect ICOs , reason closing down.Other exchanges quickly followed BTCC 's lead . ViaBTC Yunbi announced ’ ceasing operations end month . Huobi OKCoin , two major Chinese exchanges , announced would shutting , though end October . And BitKan , big over-the-counter ( OTC ) trading service rather order-book exchange , announced would shutting well.While cited guidelines initially seem concern bitcoin , likely Chinese officials made clear separate channels apply cryptocurrency . Bloomberg ( among others ) reports exchange operators decided close in-person meetings PBOC officials , Wall Street Journal reports — based anonymous sources — PBOC prepared set “ draft instructions ” would ban cryptocurrency trading altogether . These draft instructions also leaked ( translation ) far verified authenticity.The content leaked documents also consistent warnings issued Chinese quasi-regulatory body — National Internet Finance Association China ( NIFA ) — regarding cryptocurrency trading , published shortly exchanges announced would shutting down.According NIFA , Bitcoin exchanges lack “ legal basis ” operate country . Additionally , NIFA official Li Lihui told technology conference Shanghai Friday goal China ’ monetary regulation ensure “ source destination every piece money tracked. ” The Status BitcoinAs far official statements go , Bitcoin banned China . Owning , using , — importantly — mining bitcoin technically affected published guidelines.However , unverified reports ( translation ) consistent reporting Wall Street Journal , claim Bitcoin blocked so-called “ great firewall China. ” Specifically , seed addresses , help bootstrap new Bitcoin node , Bitcoin blocks , necessary construct blockchain , would filtered internet traffic China , using deep packet inspection.Additionally , major foreign Bitcoin exchanges like Coinbase , Bitfinex LocalBitcoins would added list banned domains , already includes sites like Google Facebook . And even private trading cryptocurrency arranged chat-apps like Telegram WeChat , example , could fall scrutiny , according Wall Street Journal.This much stricter stance Bitcoin , beyond exchanges also concerning Bitcoin , seem consistent comments PBOC Counselor Sheng Songcheng , reported local news sources like Shanghai Securities News . Songcheng quoted said Bitcoin poses challenge China , mentioning money laundering potential curb nation ’ economic policy.Furthermore , recent reports indicate cryptocurrency exchange operators currently allowed leave Beijing . Local news outlet BJ News writes : “ [ According ] number informed sources , current special currency trading platform executives allowed leave Beijing , [ order ] cooperate investigation . In accordance regulatory requirements , trading platform shareholders , actual controller , executives , financial executives [ must ] fully cooperate relevant work clean-up period Beijing. ” ( Rough translation . ) What This Means…Trading bitcoin via dedicated exchange platforms China table — clear.But ’ yet clear successful full Chinese Bitcoin blockade could . It would technically require single Bitcoin block maximum four megabytes make China every 10 minutes , potentially even satellite , entire country able access blockchain . As , banning individual Chinese citizens owning using bitcoin might prove difficult , even exchange platforms close down.Perhaps even important question happen Bitcoin mining : It ’ likely Bitcoin ’ hash power currently situated Asian country . While miners able connect rest world , according ViaBTC CEO Haipo Yang , ’ unclear connection allowed much longer . If Chinese authorities indeed intend ban Bitcoin country entirely , Bitcoin mining operations — mining pools hash power data centers — easy targets shut down.On hand , first time fears China “ banning Bitcoin ” raised . In past , concerns simply prelude stricter regulations local authorities.It suggested Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu , perhaps bit optimistically , exchanges simply require new license continue operation . Similarly , ’ speculated PBOC may introduce national digital currency sort gateway cryptocurrency : This would allow central bank better track flow funds bitcoin order counter money laundering capital flight.Then , could make sense introduce national digital currency substitute Bitcoin , Bitcoin effectively banned , suggested ZeroHedge.For , uncertainty prevails.The South Korean Financial Services Commission ( FSC ) announced ban forms initial coin offerings ( ICOs ) . After meeting discuss virtual currency control , vice-chairman financial affairs , Kim Yong-bum , made comment part official statement : “ We expressed serious concern recent inflow funds nonproductive speculative direction showing . As result , believe additional measures inevitable order switch productive investment. ” The statement concludes saying : “ All forms ICO prohibition including securities issuance [ ] monetary lending coin margins prohibited , blocking business related business alliances. ” Korean blockchain expert entrepreneur Ash Han told Bitcoin Magazine “ FSC concerned ignorant investors becoming victimized scammers using crypto. ” Specifically , Han referring multi-level marketing network marketing , infamous way raise money using existing distributors recruit new distributors . This type business strategy often fraught pyramid schemes raising money new recruits buying primary focus business instead actual product development sales.Because FSC judged virtual currencies bitcoin ether electronic representations value financial products securities , government chosen indirectly regulate virtual currencies banks.In addition FSC , several government organizations including Korean Fair Trade Commission ( KFTC ) , National Tax Service ( Korean IRS ) police formed joint inspection system examine current conditions virtual currency exchanges on-site inspections.The FSC examine customer information leakages caused hacking , strengthen penalties similar behavior prevent money laundering , open joint inspections system several government entities examine current conditions digital currency traders exchanges . The joint inspection system also examine regulatory taxation trends countries international organizations form consensus character virtual currency trade taxation.Until December , virtual currencies bitcoin ether traded exchange bank confirmed authorization account . “ We begin transaction checking identity bank account monitoring flow funds , ” stated official Financial Services Commission . According Han , employing banks keep track new accounts opened exchanges permit FSC ’ investigation violations regarding Know Your Customer ( KYC ) Anti-Money Laundering ( AML ) protocols . The change virtual currency exchange customers customers need able prove bank accounts connected exchange belong them.While new regulations could efforts correct South Korea ’ frenzied ICO market , Han points South Korean authorities tightened control virtual currencies much like China , could “ put huge tax crypto-related activities. ” Jay Kim , a.k.a The Crypto Lark , Korean digital currency YouTube host , says country ’ ICO ban affect individual investors participate foreign ICOs . “ In Korea , people actively investing ICOs affected . The government concerned scams . I think ’ temporary measure regulations place ICOs. ” Scams Bad ActorsThis news comes surprise given overall global move regulate ICOs way . China banned issuance virtual currencies illegal public funding . In July , U.S. Securities Exchange Commission issued warning token sales would regulated securities thus would comply reporting consumer protection requirements . On August 1 , Monetary Authority Singapore ( MAS ) clarified issue digital tokens would regulated MAS digital tokens constitute products regulated Securities Futures Act.Also , South Korean digital currency exchanges consistently targeted hackers last several months . According report security firm FireEye , North Korea targeting digital currency exchanges since April 2017.Since May 2017 , North Korean actors targeted least three South Korean digital exchanges intent stealing funds . This type attack predominantly targeted “ personal email accounts South Korean employees digital exchanges using tax-themed lure deploy malware. ” On July 5 2017 Bithumb victim major hack . Bithumb remains South Korea ’ largest digital currency exchange , world ’ second-largest Ethereum exchange daily volume . At time hack , 13.5 percent total ether market going Bithumb ’ exchange . Attacks one would certainly attracted scrutiny Korea ’ Internet Security Agency.Growth OpportunityThis latest blow South Korea ’ cryptocurrency community comes time recent growth opportunity , despite persistent scams hacks bad actors . Since China ’ ICO ban early September , South Korea quickly overtaking China daily trading volume digital currencies.The country ’ connection internet technology general underestimated . According 2015 study content delivery network Akamai , South Korea fastest internet speed world based unique IP count , largest export company , Samsung Electronics , made profit $ 16.5 billion USD 2016.South Korea ’ third-largest exchange , Coinone , recently opened “ world ’ first blockchain 4D zone , ” brick-and-mortar exchange complete bitcoin ATM , large display real-time market information face-to-face consultation service.The South Korean fintech firm Dunamu announced launch new crypto-trading platform partnership U.S.-based exchange Bittrex . The platform , called Upbit , released beta October . It support 110 different digital currencies including bitcoin , litecoin , ripple ether.In terms popularity , digital currency community Seoul alone enormous 16 registered cryptocurrency Meetups , largest Seoul Ethereum Meetup approximately 3,550 members . In past year government even taken part digital currency industry auctioning confiscated bitcoin.Two months ago , U.S. Treasury ’ Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ( “ FinCEN ” ) , working U.S. Attorney ’ Office Northern District California ( “ USAO ” ) , assessed civil money penalty $ 110 million BTC-e ( aka Canton Business Corporation ) willfully violating U.S. anti-money laundering ( AML ) laws . Alexander Vinnik , Russian national one operators BTC-e , arrested abroad indicted conspiracy money laundering connection facilitating $ 4 billion ransomware payouts related financial crimes focused individuals engage activities ranging computer hacking drug trafficking.The prosecution BTC-e FinCEN Vinnik USAO surprise . BTC-e alleged hub criminal activity . Businesses operating digital currency space may look prosecutions find insignificant alleged conduct conduct engaged , good corporate citizens facilitate criminal activity . But prosecutions remind us advent Bitcoin digital currencies ( sometimes referred virtual currencies , cryptocurrencies , altcoins tokens ) raises serious issue : When businesses digital currency space become “ financial institutions ” must collect retain information customers share information FinCEN accordance federal Bank Secrecy Act ( “ BSA ” ) ? Real lessons learned re-examining FinCEN ’ 2013 guidance , entitled “ Application FinCEN ’ Regulations Persons Administering , Exchanging , Using Virtual Currencies , ” revisiting prosecution Ripple Labs , Inc. , ( “ Ripple ” ) FinCEN coordination USAO , Ripple settled 2015 . FinCEN ’ action Ripple first civil enforcement action virtual currency exchange failing implement effective AML program failing report suspicious activity related certain financial transactions . FinCEN ’ recent action BTC-e first time FinCEN prosecuted foreign entity operating “ money services business ” defined BSA . FinCEN asserted jurisdiction BTC-e BTC-e processed nearly $ 300 million transactions involving U.S. customers.Compliance BSA particularly sensitive topic digital currency industry digital currency transactions recorded blockchain , distributed electronic ledger , contains personally identifiable information ( “ PII ” ) , thus digital identities concealed . The BSA mandates record-keeping reporting requirements certain transactions , including identity individual engaged transaction , financial institutions use Currency Transaction Reports ( “ CTRs ” ) , Suspicious Activity Reports ( “ SARs ” ) , Currency Monetary Instrument Reports ( “ CMIRs ” ) Foreign Bank Financial Accounts Reports ( “ FBARs ” ) . After September 11 , 2001 , attacks , Patriot Act amended BSA adding know-your-customer ( “ KYC ” ) reporting requirements include enhanced due-diligence policies , procedures controls reasonably designed detect report instances money laundering terrorist financing.The BSA applies “ financial institutions ” ( defined statute ) , digital currency businesses fall “ money transmitter ” ( “ MT ” ) “ money services business ” ( “ MSB ” ) categories financial institutions regulated BSA . In 2013 , FinCEN issued guidance statements would enforce AML requirements MTs MSBs operating digital currency space , particularly respect exchanges virtual currencies trade , systems providing services exchanges . Individual investors need fear — individual ( company ) invest digital currency sell currencies profit without complying BSA . However , company helps others buy , sell send digital currency “ accepting transmitting ” digital currency must comply BSA. “ Accepting transmitting ” means company receives digital currency one customer sends behalf another person . Merely giving digital currency someone accepting digital currency someone — example , method payment — mean “ financial institution ” BSA . In addition , develop distribute software facilitate sale digital currency need comply BSA . But , exchanger “ buys sells [ digital currency ] ... reason , ” providing brokerage exchange service customers , subject BSA.In addition , given wave recent initial coin offerings ( “ ICOs ” ) digital currencies used various purposes offered public sale , important note digital currency need used like fiat currency order subject BSA — simply needs used “ value ” “ substitutes currency. ” There conflicting guidance whether offerers digital currency sell tokens U.S. citizens subject BSA . However , FinCEN advised company selling digital currency account subject BSA reporting requirements.Notwithstanding guidance , FinCEN ’ 2015 settlement Ripple , alleged Ripple ’ mere sale XRP , digital currency , rendered Ripple MSB violated BSA failing register FinCEN , failing implement maintain adequate AML program . Of course , Ripple currency exchange would ordinarily subject BSA , fact FinCEN ’ settlement Ripple specifically alleges Ripple ’ sale XRP violated BSA raises issues risk uncertainty legal standpoint digital currency offerers respect compliance BSA.In conclusion , companies operate considering operating digital currency space conduct thorough analysis anti-money laundering regulations understand potential registration requirements FinCEN whether required implement AML policies procedures comply BSA.A startling trend recently emerged cryptocurrency industry . Since July 2017 , U.S. Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) regularly begun asserting space . It taken various actions several companies relating Initial Coin Offerings , “ ICOs , ” cryptocurrency activities . It investigated The DAO , online corporation , declared ICO involved securities subject regulation federal securities laws . It also suspended trading stock four companies due concerns accuracy public information relating cryptocurrency activities . What trend mean industry ? Looking closely SEC ’ actions , answer : vigilant paranoid.The DAO LegacyFederal securities laws generally require instruments constituting “ securities ” registered SEC order protect investors ensuring public access key information needed making informed investment decision . On July 25 , 2017 , SEC issued Report Investigation The DAO , concluding DAO Tokens sold ICO “ investment contracts ” therefore securities registered.The DAO ( short Decentralized Autonomous Organization ) sold one billion DAO Tokens exchange ether . The proceeds used fund various “ projects ” vetted approved Curators , selected The DAO ’ founders . DAO Token holders could vote projects fund , profits projects would distributed among Token holders.Applying Howey test ( named Supreme Court case announced ) , says something investment contract involves ( 1 ) investment money ( 2 ) common enterprise ( 3 ) reasonable expectation profits derived managerial efforts others , SEC found DAO Tokens securities : Purchasing DAO Tokens exchange ether constituted “ investment money ” ; A “ common enterprise ” existed ether pooled used fund projects aimed making profits , would distributed DAO Token holders ; andDAO Token holders expected profits efforts The DAO founders Curators , , among things , created monitored The DAO vetted potential projects . While Token holders could vote projects fund , still essentially relying others , could vote projects curated.Although findings applied The DAO , SEC noted wanted “ stress U.S. federal securities law may apply various activities , including distributed ledger technology , depending particular facts circumstances , without regard form organization technology used effectuate particular offer sale. ” This declaration undoubtedly foreshadows continued investigations enforcement actions relating ICOs.Trading SuspensionsFederal law authorizes SEC suspend trading company ’ stock summarily 10 business days needed protect investors public interest . In recent Investor Alert , SEC explained suspensions may result “ lack current , accurate , adequate information company ” ; “ questions accuracy publicly available information ” concerning company ’ “ operational status financial condition ” ; “ questions trading stock. ” In cryptocurrency context , SEC especially concerned scams companies “ publicly announc [ e ] ICO coin/token related events affect price company ’ common stock. ” It warned specifically two red flags signaling possible “ ICO-related fraud ” : companies whose stock trading ( 1 ) claim without explanation ICO “ SEC-compliant ” ( 2 ) “ purport [ ] raise capital ICO take ICO-related business described vague nonsensical terms using undefined technical legal jargon. ” In August 2017 , SEC issued 10-day suspension orders shares four companies due concerns relating public statements cryptocurrency activities ICOs . First , August 3 , SEC suspended trading shares Strategic Global Investments , Inc. , questions regarding accuracy statements certain press releases relating “ activities company respect [ ICOs ] . ” Each cited press releases touted generally company planned sponsor “ SEC compliant ICOs. ” Next , August 9 , SEC issued temporary trading ban shares CIAO Group ( recently renamed NuMelo Technology ) due questions regarding accuracy various public statements relating certain business plans planned ICO . The cited press releases , including March 16 , June 15 July 6 , contained vague statements CIAO planned invest telecommunications projects emerging markets facilitate provision financial services developing nations blockchain technology , including ICO.On August 23 , SEC suspended trading shares First Bitcoin Capital Corp. , company involved developing digital currencies blockchain technology , due “ concerns regarding accuracy adequacy publicly available information company including , among things , value [ ] assets capital structure. ” Finally , August 24 , SEC issued suspension order American Security Resources Corp. ( renamed Bitcoin Crypto Currency Exchange Corp. ) due statements press releases “ concerning , among things , company ’ business transition cryptocurrency markets early adoption blockchain technology. ” These press releases August 1 August 8 announced vaguely company “ enter [ ing ] booming Crypto currency markets , ” developing mobile cryptocurrency trading application acquiring company created “ smartphone-based payment money transfer system. ” The SEC ’ suspension orders specify language facts triggering action , companies appears strayed red-flag territory SEC identified . Its oversight area thus likely continue directed preventing fraud improving disclosures investors new not-well-understood technologies.Implications Cryptocurrency IndustryThis recent flurry SEC activity taken seriously cryptocurrency industry start . The SEC continue monitor businesses involved cryptocurrencies . Companies considering engaging ICOs therefore carefully consider seek legal advice regarding whether tokens possess characteristics might make resemble securities . They also consult counsel preparing public statements relating cryptocurrency activities assets.Anyone predicting beginning-of-the-end industry based events , however , overreacting . As businesses become engaged cryptocurrency-related activities , people buy tokens invest companies innovating within cryptocurrency space , ignites regulators ’ investor-protection instincts . While SEC bared teeth perceived threat investors , demonstrated aggression toward industry whole . Indeed , SEC careful say ICOs categorically involve securities ; cautioned whether token security depends “ facts circumstances ” case . That SEC watching cryptocurrency industry thus symptom industry ’ success , sign demise.In Canada , steps taken bring Initial Coin Offerings ( ICOs ) within regulatory framework . TokenFunder , Toronto-based startup helps startups launch manage ICOs , first company win approval ICO Ontario Securities Commission ( OSC ) .While ICOs come regulatory scrutiny lately , TokenFunder CEO Alan Wunsche believes ICOs done right , built-in safeguards avoid fraud.Wunsche said press release issued Bitcoin Magazine : “ TokenFunder working Ontario Securities Commission ’ LaunchPad past year define innovative funding model businesses .

This includes exemption registering investor exemption limit amount raised one offering.Wunsche notes many firms using ICOs raise investment funding able verify funds coming making risky raise money way . He believes safe way use ICOs offering expertise provide investor protection within sound regulatory framework.Like many jurisdictions around world , Ontario government looking ways regulate ICOs without stifling innovation driving startups jurisdictions.To date , startups holding ICOs without regulatory approval saying tokens coins securities.What TokenFunder Is SellingTokenFunder offers ICO process claim build trust digital finance use best practices , including smart contracts build legal compliance regulatory compliance ensure investor ’ rights protected.TokenFunder offers token launch advisory services designed operate within applicable securities laws de-risk offerings purchases coins issuers purchasers providing , among things , regulatory approved platform related support.TokenFunder co-founder Laura Pratt said press release : “ A unique feature FNDR token lets investors share future success platform .

Its volunteer members aim create legal regulatory environment state welcomes cryptocurrencies blockchain technology companies open arms.Among group ’ advisors Patrick Byrne , CEO Overstock — Byrne lives Utah Bitcoin advocate years — former Wyoming governor , two deans computer science department head University Wyoming.Outdated LawsBitcoin used welcome Wyoming . But 2015 interpretation Wyoming Money Transmitters Act ( state passed 2003 , years Bitcoin even existed ) Wyoming Division Banking made impractical cryptocurrency exchanges operate state.Cryptocurrencies specifically included list “ permissible investments ” within Act , stocks securities would . As result , learning would put huge financial backing stay operation state , Coinbase suspended operations Wyoming indefinitely June 2015 . But lot people think law ’ make sense . They see cryptocurrency future , think Wyoming would benefit progressive.Caitlin Long one people . Now living New York , serves chairman president smart contracts platform company Symbiont , Long grew Laramie , Wyoming.Over summer , wanted give back alma mater . But went personally fund endowment female engineers University Wyoming , found school unable accept bitcoin appreciated asset . Fortunately , Long able find charity outside Wyoming could legally liquidate bitcoin send university donor-advised fund. “ They still got cash , prompted lot discussion internally university ‘ happened ? ’ ” Long told Bitcoin Magazine.Long would disclose much donated , typically , donations endowment $ 50,000 up. “ When universities donors interested donating properties , usually try find ways accept properties , ” said . The event prompted lot discussion among people within university eventually led formation coalition aimed educating advocating adoption blockchain technology state . Long offered services advisor member . “ I ’ business , ” said . “ So I volunteered help bitcoin blockchain education efforts. ” No Time LoseThe coalition moving quickly . Within week , group formed LLC , sent press release stating goals launched website . “ This , new , happening real time , ” said Long.They good reason make haste . The new legislative session begins February . If coalition wants push bill get digital currencies recognized “ permissible investment ” Wyoming Money Transmitters Act , need move quickly.Currently group working legislative language local attorneys legislators . Next , need educate citizens Wyoming legislators benefits Bitcoin blockchain technologies . Some involve webinars live events , well organizing dinner Cheyenne legislative session . Last year , similar regulatory effort , Wyoming House Bill 26 , pass , due lack knowledge “ unrelated political feuds , ” Robert Jennings , another one group ’ advisor members , told Bitcoin Magazine.This time around , thinks “ blockchain [ technology ] cryptocurrency stand merits. ” Jennings added , “ There already groundswell support state due rise popularity Bitcoin. ” But , cautioned , require “ extensive education campaign , formed Wyoming Blockchain Coalition. ” Three months passed since People ’ Bank China ( PBOC ) issued official statement explicitly defining initial coin offerings ( ICOs ) illegal public financing activities . As result , China-based ICO projects required refund initial investments , regardless whether project-based tokens issued ; foreign-based projects required refund investors long tokens issued ; importantly , China-based bitcoin exchanges , including Huobi , OKCoin BTCC , shut . The reason given shutting : pressure “ related government departments. ” Pessimists believed would herald end Bitcoin China — even around world — sentiment enhanced astonishing plummet bitcoin price Chinese exchanges around $ 7,400 low $ 2,400 . And , usual , whenever rumors float China , markets react — whether rumors based entirely , partially truth.As bitcoin exchanges China shut , public trading volumes Chinese Yuan became literally zero ; therefore , news China related Bitcoin irrelevant price . Bitcoin ’ ferocious bounce-back nearly $ 8,000 mid-November 2017 , all-time high , confirmed point matter going China regardless Chinese hurdles , price bitcoin continue ascent.But exception : mining.Will Mining Be Shut Down ? China still largest host country mining facilities . Indeed , 70 percent hash power globally comes Chinese mining pools . The miners produced Chinese company Bitmain dominate whole industry.People worry whether Chinese government ban mining , thereby eliminating Bitcoin China source throwing ecosystem disarray . However , highly unlikely.The recent rumor mining ban becoming reality derived flyer , distributed power station Chinese province Sichuan . The flyer stated , “ Bitcoin illegal thus company shall provide electricity mining facilities. ” In fact , flyer nothing poorly worded , company-level notice mistakenly used word “ illegal. ” The content , however , since misconstrued proof official ban Bitcoin mining . The financial desk Caixin — reputable Chinese news source — several citizen-based media sources interviewed power company question . These sources since confirmed interpretation nothing overhyped “ fake news. ” The notice meant internal use . Its chief aim warn affiliates risks associated providing illegal electricity . The power station affiliates generate electricity secured requisite approval government sell electricity anyone — miners.It important reiterate China never denounced Bitcoin illegal . Bitcoin China regarded type good . “ People freedom participate [ ] bitcoin trading type goods internet , ” PBOC notice stated 2013 . Therefore , government reason shut “ factories ” producing normal “ goods. ” While true reports circulating mining facilities facing pressure possible suspension , reason pressure related illegal use electricity , mining activities.More convincingly , Caixin reported October 13 “ person close regulator said Caixin China plan ban mining. ” Lastly , good chance China could decide create regulated Bitcoin trading market . If plans become reality , China even less likely ban mining.There two reasons theory may valid . First , China highly motivated enter trading market . Japan licensed several cryptocurrency exchanges , CME stepping efforts list bitcoin futures build regulated trading market.China , second-largest economy , good reason want build regulated market , . The logic bitcoin trading ’ simply banned single government due decentralized nature , banning result uncontrollable OTC trading might result hidden-capital flight . This last thing Chinese government want see . Therefore , external pressure Bitcoin ’ internal features drive China think better mode regulation.Second , Caixin also hinted regulated bitcoin market China might possible article titled “ Will Bitcoin Come Back China After China Becomes Less Relevant Bitcoin ? ” The article ends : “ Maybe someday regulators find better way regulate Bitcoin , ’ preclude possibility Bitcoin come back China. ” Caixin holds special status among media sources Chinese Bitcoin industry . It long primary source regulation policy signals PBOC : It literally become mouthpiece PBOC regard regulating Bitcoin . The fact sentiment allowed published tightly controlled circumstances makes particularly interesting relevant.Blockchain Development Still Going StrongThe reputation blockchain technology , underlies Bitcoin , stained speculation side bitcoin alt coins extent . But luckily , development blockchain technology still important directive priority China.According China ’ Premier Li Keqiang last year ― government ’ 13th Five-Year Plan Economic Social Development ― blockchain technology listed important area development Chinese endeavors . As long remains case China , expect see overall favorable conditions accelerated growth industry.Chinese blockchain startups beginning expand communities overseas , Chinese exchanges launched international sites . Investors , though less less openly , still committing blockchain-based enterprises . Consortium blockchain solutions welcomed big companies . In short , rationality less speculation.In fact , so-called ICO ban actually announcement , rather specific law . There subtle balance industry regulators . The industry testing governmental regulatory boundaries reaches toward autonomy . The government , part , observing whether industry really live revolutionary promises deciding best way encourage innovation also avoiding speculation risks.The blockchain industry needs win regulators ’ trust actually solving commercial pain points prove token-oriented models feasible . If project prove tokens still remain tool pure speculation , industry simply ’ expect looser policies . It crypto blockchain community live promise deliver innovation modern world needs expects.Bitcoin futures contracts offered CME Group Inc. Cboe Futures Exchange mainstream investors.CME Group , world ’ largest futures exchange , announced self-certified initial listing Bitcoin futures contract . CME first announced intentions launch Bitcoin futures product October 31 , 2017.The new contract available trading CME Globex electronic trading platform effective Sunday , December 17 , 2017 , trade date December 18.At time , Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) also announced Cboe Futures Exchange ( CFE ) self-certified new contracts Bitcoin futures products , Cantor Exchange ( Cantor ) self-certified new contract Bitcoin binary options. “ Bitcoin , virtual currency , commodity unlike Commission dealt past , ” said CFTC Chairman J.

After record high Wednesday bitcoin price $ 11,377 , 20 percent drop profit takers $ 9,021 ; since fluctuated several times selling around $ 10,500.On December 11 , U.S. Securities Exchange Commision ( SEC ) issued cease-and-desist California-based Munchee Inc. stop ICO return funds collected.Munchee seeking $ 15 million capital improve existing mobile app create restaurant review ecosystem described “ Yelp meets Instagram ” Bitcointalk announcement . The problem arose Munchee emphasized would take steps create secondary market tokens investment vehicle , leading investors reasonable belief tokens would rise value , long advance utility token made available.In SEC announcement , Stephanie Avakian , co-director SEC Enforcement Division , said , “ We continue scrutinize market vigilantly improper offerings seek sell securities general public without required registration exemption . In deciding impose penalty , Commission recognized company stopped ICO quickly , immediately returned proceeds issuing tokens , cooperated investigation. ” In SEC complaint , commission argued MUN tokens considered securities “ investment contracts ” deemed security regardless utility time sale . Munchee consented SEC ’ order without admitting , denying , findings.The action significant shows willingness SEC step take action . It also illustrates willingness part SEC work companies cooperative run afoul regulations.Since late November 2017 , South Korea looked regulate cryptocurrency trading domestic exchanges , including Bithumb , Coinone Korbit , The Korea Herald reports .

It comes ahead chairman ’ oral testimony U.S. Senate Committee Banking , Housing Urban Affairs February 6 , 2018 , matter “ Virtual Currencies : The Oversight Role U.S. Securities Exchange Commission U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. ” Usually written testimony closely mirrors language expect oral testimony today . Going written testimony , several key takeaways note . ( If opinions chairs contained article seem familiar , ’ co-authored op-ed Wall Street Journal January 24 , 2018 , ostensibly laying groundwork ahead testimony . ) Point # 1 : IF seek raise capital fund enterprise via ICO , SEC views offer sale securities , venture subject laws governing sale securities.For cryptocurrency world , bad news coin invested determined actual security . On page 3 written testimony , Clayton stated : There misunderstanding law . When investors offered sold securities — date ICOs largely — entitled benefits state federal securities laws sellers market participants must follow laws.It seems Chairman Clayton believes ICOs unregistered securities ; meaning , considered , ’ violation state federal laws . Clayton evidences supposition , noting , “ For seek raise capital fund enterprise , many ICO space sought , primary entry SEC ’ jurisdiction offer sale securities , set forth Securities Act 1933. ” Here , Clayton stating ventures seeking raise funds via ICO consider , “ primary entry , ” registering security SEC.At crux chairman ’ points argument industry faced fundamental fashion , especially ICOs . That argument , Clayton puts page 6 testimony , “ Is coin token security ? ” While Clayton demur say answer ICO question depends individual facts coin token , state “ date ICOs registered SEC , SEC also approved listing trading exchange-traded products ( ETFs ) holding cryptocurrencies assets related cryptocurrencies. ” How Clayton Arrives That Point : As governing definition securities , Chairman Clayton cited §2 ( ) ( 1 ) Securities Act 1933 well §3 ( ) ( 10 ) Securities Exchange Act 1934 . ( These two Acts two primary three bodies law outline regulations U.S. investment industry — third Investment Advisers Act 1940 , “ 40 Act ” colloquially . ) These sections define security “ includ [ ing ] , among items , ‘ investment contract. ’ ” According federal laws Title 15 U.S. Code , investment contract “ investment money common enterprise reasonable expectation profits derived entrepreneurial managerial efforts others. ” See 15 U.S.C . §§ 77b–77c.Point # 2 : The U.S. regulators apply “ facts circumstances ” analysis , utilizing principles-based framework determine ICOs cryptocurrency markets classified securities.This potential sigh relief cryptocurrency industry . If chairs remain steadfast point , appears crackdown different coins come piecemeal fashion merits coins individually , rather broad-swept ruling . Referring testimony report issued July 25 , 2017 , DAO tokens test case , chair seems suggest methodology determining DAO tokens securities allegorized coins tokens offered space.Going page 7 testimony , chair states “ Commission ’ message issuers [ conduct ICO ] market professionals space clear : would use distributed ledger technology raise capital engage securities transactions must take appropriate steps ensure compliance federal securities laws. ” Point # 3 : We name “ Investor Protection. ” This preemptive Fear , Uncertainty Doubt ( FUD ) propagating line towed every regulator safeguarding economy prosperous North Korea ’ . However , point Chairman Clayton makes cryptocurrencies without merit.Specific types investor protection new application current regulatory framework cryptocurrencies hopes improve include : improper nonexistent disclosure ( KYC/AML ) ; volatility ( flash-crash-like issues , endemic asset class issues could cause marketwide panic among investable asset classes ) ; andall theft fraud industry.As chair puts portion written testimony entitled “ Enforcement , ” new cyber unit established within SEC ’ Enforcement Division September 2017 , focused misconduct involving industry specifically targeting types behaviors listed . Point # 4 : Cryptocurrencies ’ “ currency , ” ’ “ securities ” either.The chairman ’ come right directly say , page 5 written testimony , states : While cryptocurrencies , least currently designed , promoted used , appear securities , simply calling something ‘ currency ’ currency-based product mean security.The chair note slightly testimony “ SEC direct oversight transactions currencies commodities , including currency trading platforms. ” Point # 5 : But save prohibition average individual investor ... Prohibiting certain classes investors participating security marketplace nothing new . For example , certain private offerings allowed accredited individual investors , others reserved specific classes investor.As individual investors cryptocurrency space ( “ Retail Investors ” “ Main Street Investors ” ) , following statements written testimony disheartening.SEC Chair Clayton states page 2 written testimony efforts “ driven various factors , significantly concern many Main Street investors understand material facts risks involved. ” While ’ surprise investors cryptocurrencies currently volatile risky asset class , even hint Main Street investors lack understanding notion often serves rationale restricting non-accredited retail investors access complicated illiquid financial instruments.The chair stated , “ Many trading platforms even referred ‘ exchanges. ’ I concerned appearance deceiving. ” In Clayton ’ view , investors transacting exchanges receive many market protections would traditional investment exchanges . While chairman could lauded sentiment protecting investors , especially given risks trading exchanges exposed investors loss past , alternative view statement SEC chairman seeking find way regulate exchanges provide Retail Investors access — leaving cryptocurrencies legally accessible sufficiently educated risks , product space , case accredited investors , allowing rich invest cryptocurrencies.We update takeaways Senate Hearing shortly.Regulators Hong Kong issued strict warning exchanges business Chinese customers trading tokens deemed securities.In announcement today , Hong Kong ’ Securities Futures Commission ( SFC ) said sent letters seven Hong Kong exchanges firms attempting fundraise initial coin offerings ( ICOs ) , warning legalities selling digital tokens characteristics securities . Most receiving letter confirmed compliance SFC 's regulatory regime delisted tokens question.The agency said receiving complaints Chinese citizens market manipulation exchanges . Some said unable withdraw funds reported significant losses due “ technical breakdowns ” exchanges . `` We continue police market enforce necessary , '' SFC CEO Ashley Alder said statement . `` But also urging market professionals proper gatekeeping prevent frauds dubious fundraising assist us ensuring compliance law . `` The agency also cautioned investors risks involved trading cryptocurrencies , including price volatility , theft fraud , difficulty recovering losses . `` If investors fully understand risks cryptocurrencies ICOs prepared significant loss , invest , '' said Julia Leung , executive director intermediaries SFC . `` Investors store fiat currencies cryptocurrencies unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges aware risks hacking misappropriation assets . `` The SFC issued two prior warnings exchanges , one September December , selling bitcoin futures.Today ’ statement follows denial Hong Kong–based exchange Binance , one largest cryptocurrency exchanges , hacked suspended trading Thursday . The company blamed suspension prolonged system upgrade.Regulators Europe U.S. coming fraud space . Earlier week , representatives U.S. Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) spoke Senate Banking Committee future cryptocurrency regulations . And recently , several U.S. banks banned customers using credit cards buy digital currencies exchanges . On February 4 , 2018 , 10:10 p.m. China Standard Time , Financialnews , rather small news agency administration China ’ central bank , People ’ Bank China ( PBOC ) , released article explicitly stated “ China continue watch virtual currency activities related closely , take actions including shutting commercial presences exchanges within China ’ territory uphold China ’ financial stability. ” This first time China sent regulation signal public official channel since September 4 , 2017 , PBOC , China Banking Regulatory Commission , China Insurance Regulatory Commission state-level government agencies China issued joint statement announcing ICOs regarded “ illegal financing activities. ” More importantly , Xinhua News Agency ( state media organ ) news page Chinese government website reposted news , confirming authenticity.The announcement reads : “ Since joint statement September 4 , China ’ regulator still finds many Chinese begun conduct activities regarding cryptocurrency overseas . Considering risks trading overseas Chinese may face , regulator take measures. “ The risks mentioned joint statement still exist : illegal ICOs , fraudulent projects even Ponzi schemes . If investors considering projects set overseas , risks even higher since losses difficult recover. “ According source PBOC , China ’ regulator adopt series regulatory measures including banning related commercial presences shutting exchanges home abroad prevent financial risks safeguard financial stability . No exchange exception . In meantime , possibility introducing regulatory measures ’ ruled out. ” However , ’ yet clear regulatory measures , China still working figure best ways regulate cryptocurrency market.How Can We Interpret China ’ Latest Policy Signals ? As Bitcoin Magazine reported , bitcoin trading cryptocurrency trading ’ simply banned single government due decentralized nature . Banning result uncontrollable OTC trading might result hidden-capital flight . This last thing Chinese government want see ; therefore , policy regarded signal intimidate bad actors remind potential investors associated risks , rather interpreting Chinese government ’ final attitude toward blockchain technology innovation.The tightening policy expected , current ICO projects tend lack requisite transparency project information financing phase , risks related security assets exchanges abound . The Chinese regulator also come fire lately slow response cases outside blockchain industry . For example , criticized clamping Ezubao — fraudulent peer-to-peer lending company inflicted great financial loss $ 7.6 billion everyday investors 2014 . Most recently , failed tackle problem “ campus lending ” companies provide college students seemingly easy access loans condition provide nude photos , companies later use threaten students pay back higher-than-normal interest . News students commit suicide unable pay back money surfacing almost every week.It likely China ’ regulator want move step ahead extreme cases occur cryptocurrency industry.And Then There Is Blockchain Technology …China ’ national strategy local development plans indicate China still openly supports blockchain technology . ( See article Op Ed : China 's ICO Ban Is Characteristic — Not Catastrophic ) .It would appear government still observing whether industry really live revolutionary promises deciding best way encourage innovation also avoiding speculation risks.In order blockchain industry succeed , first needs win regulators ’ trust actually solving commercial pain points prove token-oriented models feasible , especially using token-economy business model . If project prove tokens still remain tool pure speculation , even cause financial instability , remains highly unlikely Chinese government ( government , matter ) soften regulatory stance . The onus , therefore , sits squarely crypto asset blockchain community live promise deliver innovation modern world needs expects.Japan 's largest Bitcoin blockchain company , bitFlyer , received official license operate state Illinois.After receiving “ BitLicense ” operate virtual currency exchange New York November 2017 , Tokyo-based company received approval operate 44 states territories .

During meeting , members Bitcoin cryptoasset industry shared information regarding emerging market offered guidance CFTC may approach regulating space 2018.Multiple participants public hearing made comments differentiate different types cryptoassets associated technologies.Potential regulation around cryptoasset exchanges also discussed potential area regulation , noted regulators worldwide past months.By end portion public hearing dedicated virtual currencies , TAC voted unanimously recommend CFTC create subcommittee new asset class.Differentiating Between Different Types CryptoassetsOne key points made invited speak cryptoasset industry tokens coins necessarily treated equally . For example , opening remarks , Coin Center Executive Director Jerry Brito discussed differences traditional cryptocurrencies , bitcoin , initial coin offerings ( ICOs ) . “ Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin commodities , course , SEC previously [ said ] . Questions remain however borders [ around ] categories one responsibly share tokens future investors , ” noted Brito.Special Counsel Gary DeWaal Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP went discuss often-mentioned Howey Test helps determine types tokens securities U.S. law . In DeWaal ’ view , CFTC could offer assistance differentiating commodities securities cryptoasset market. “ Ultimately clarification . The distinction commodity , distinction security , may seem ( common sense perspective ) clear , , important issues around I think committee could much [ help clarify ] , ” said DeWaal.Notably , DeWaal also pointed cryptoassets “ critical ” decentralized ledgers. “ They mechanism proof-of-work blockchains miners rewarded : In proof-of-state blockchains fees paid , ways incentivize folks keep system together . If ’ talking centralized ledgers , sure , ’ need worry coins , ” DeWaal added.Regulation Cryptoasset ExchangesRGM Advisors ’ chief executive , Richard Gorelick , also made appearance CFTC ’ public hearing , focused market structure cryptoassets brief opening presentation ( PDF ) . Gorelick one people room referred subject hand terms “ cryptoassets ” rather “ cryptocurrencies ” “ virtual currencies. ” One key areas focus Gorelick presentation problems associated current cryptoasset exchanges . More specifically , Gorelick discussed issues associated connectivity liquidity global exchanges. “ Generally speaking , I think trading [ exchanges ] challenging , particularly goal trade across multiple spot exchanges . It ’ difficult weave liquidity across exchanges jurisdictions due number factors , ” noted Gorelick.Some factors limiting movement funds various exchanges pointed Gorelick include : TechnologyConcerns deceptive tradingLack standard best practicesThe fickle nature banking relationshipsCapital inefficiencySecurity transparencyThe slow speed money assets move outIn face issues found cryptoasset exchanges , Gorelick hit large scale over-the-counter ( OTC ) markets.Representatives LedgerX CME also provided updates state Bitcoin futures market later public hearing.After gathering information representatives cryptoasset industry asking questions , TAC voted unanimously recommend CFTC create new subcommittee focused virtual currencies.On February 16 , 2018 , Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA put world notice first major economy set clear guidelines initial coin offerings ( ICOs ) . In announcement , Swiss regulator addressed plans apply financial market legislation different tokens well lay ICO organizers get proper input FINMA planning launching initial coin offerings.The guidelines , offered downloadable PDF , show market participants information needed help Swiss regulator adequately address issues presented inquiries regulator , well FINMA intends current financial market legislation applied ICOs . The published guidelines intended complement FINMA Guidance 04/2017 , September 2017 addressed regulatory treatment initial coin offerings . Important note FINMA ’ concern creating transparency . According regulator , “ Creating transparency time important given dynamic market high level demand. ” FINMA also cited increase number inquiries corresponding sharp increase quantity planned executed ICOs country motivating factor move.The regulator ’ concern transparency clearly illustrated state guidelines “ ICOs raise variety legal issues relevant case law consistent legal doctrine . Given wide variety types token ICO set-ups , possible generalise . Circumstances must considered holistically individual case. ” The press release guidelines also provides useful information . The Swiss regulator highlighted would focus “ underlying purpose tokens ” tokens “ tradeable transferable. ” The release also showed FINMA categorizes tokens three types — payment tokens , utility tokens asset tokens ( allowing tokens possibly take aspects one group ) — ascribes definitions organizers better understand tokens ’ potential assessment . Another major emphasis press release guidelines ’ role displaying FINMA handle ICO inquiries regarding Anti-Money Laundering ( AML ) securities regulations compliance . In release , referred market participants diagram page 8 guidelines ( shown ) , distinguishes regulator ’ stance based three categories tokens put . While press release finish note investors risks associated investing ICOs , important part announcement portion FINMA highlights “ innovative potential ” blockchain technology . In , FINMA CEO Mark Branson stated : The application blockchain technology innovative potential within far beyond financial markets . However , blockchain-based projects conducted analogously regulated activities simply circumvent tried tested regulatory framework . Our balanced approach handling ICO projects enquiries allows legitimate innovators navigate regulatory landscape launch projects way consistent laws protecting investors integrity financial system.While regulations ICOs either ambiguously evolving demonstrating outright hostility countries , FINMA given clear signal wants provide transparency , open communication certainty ( possible ) launching ICO projects within Swiss Confederation.Today , February 16 , 2018 , Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) issued press release announcing trading suspension three companies acquired AAA-rated assets “ subsidiary private equity investor cryptocurrency blockchain technology , among things. ” The three companies question , PDX Partners , Inc. , Victura Construction Group , Cherubim Interests , Inc. , trading stocks suspended 10 days SEC auspices public interest investor protection . Neither SEC suspension orders , announcements companies surrounding acquisitions , however , seem actually focus blockchain cryptocurrencies . The assets acquired trust units ( shares ) management company private equity fund invests least 12 disparate sectors , including blockchain cryptocurrencies.According orders suspension SEC , companies set alarm bells regulators Victura Construction PDX Partners issued press releases January 4 , 2018 , related pending share acquisitions . Cherubim Interests issued press release January 3 , 2018 , effect also cited SEC delinquency filings SEC.All three companies helmed CEO Patrick Johnson , former NFL journeyman wide receiver . All three companies penny stocks outdated financial information unaudited poor bookkeeping . These so-called “ penny stocks ” typically great concern U.S. regulators often subject attempted price manipulation fraud.All companies announced near beginning year acquisition trust units NVC Fund LLC , trust manager NVC Fund Holding Trust , commits private equity investments everything natural resources entertainment blockchain technology “ fintech cryptocurrency. ” According NVC fund website , trust manages assets valued $ 128 billion.Investments made three companies sums far outpaced estimated market cap gross profit companies . PDX Partners announced purchase $ 350 million trust units , despite $ 29,000 operating income end 2016 negative cash flow operations.Cherubim Interests announced purchase $ 250 million trust units , despite negative operating income negative cash flow operations 2016 year-end.Victura Construction announced purchase $ 100 million trust units , negative operating income operating cash flow last year reported financials 2014 . All told , Mr. Johnson ’ companies would taking $ 700 million investments NVC Funds.Instead focusing questionable ability three companies afford price trust units , underlying valuation assets , fact companies limited transparency websites public filings , SEC devotes half press release warning investors investing companies pivoting blockchain cryptocurrencies.Michele Wein Layne , Director Los Angeles Regional Office , stated , “ This reminder investors give heightened scrutiny penny stock companies switched focus latest business trend , cryptocurrency , blockchain technology initial coin offerings ” . It noted SEC states Cherubim Interests executed financing commitment launch ICO . This reference suspension orders idea three companies dabbled cryptocurrency blockchain space.Of course , may clarifying information SEC yet disclose future actions taken regarding three companies would clarify acquisitions directed toward blockchain cryptocurrency aspects NVC Fund ’ investments . However , press announcements companies seem specifically cited two sectors , factors SEC suspension orders suggest companies targeting NVC Fund investments particular two categories.The stated strategic focuses PDX partners , Victura Construction Cherubim Interests : telecom , disaster recovery restoration construction , alternative construction projects , respectively.In watershed moment United States blockchain cryptocurrency law , Wyoming ’ House Representatives unanimously voted “ aye ” pass two blockchain bills – HB 70 “ utility token bill ” HB 19 “ bitcoin bill ” – sending State Senate consideration . HB 70 defines utility tokens neither traditional money securities ; HB 19 exempts cryptocurrency 2003 Wyoming Money Transmitter Act ( passed state Bitcoin ’ invention 2008 ) .In interview Bitcoin Magazine , Wyoming Blockchain Coalition co-founder , 22-year Wall Street veteran , Caitlin Long , attributed much bills ’ successes far teamwork Wyoming banking security regulators efforts House Representatives member Tyler Lindholm , co-sponsor advocate five blockchain-related bills.Wyoming aims set standard blockchain-friendly regulation U.S. become hub blockchain-based innovation two bills .

A 2015 interpretation act Wyoming Division Banking made impractical cryptocurrency exchanges operate state . As result , Coinbase suspended operations Wyoming indefinitely June 2015.The passage HB 19 moves Wyoming one step closer cryptocurrency-friendly exchange regulation .

The Senate uncertain chamber . But , incredible momentum , need [ bills become acts ] majority vote Senate.Should bill pass Senate become act Wyoming , federal regulation SEC Howey Test could still nullify advocates ’ blood , sweat tears . However , Long believes Federal Law regards utility ’ established yet — , people blockchain/cryptocurrency industry “ flush cash , interested litigating issue. ” Long Wyoming blockchain proponents hope final Senate outcome HB 70 , “ utility token bill , ” HB 19 , “ Bitcoin bill , ” early middle next week.On February 20 , 2018 , investors saw signs yet another directional shift South Korea ’ regulatory stance cryptocurrencies . According Reuters , Choe Heung-sik , governor South Korea ’ Financial Supervisory Service ( FSS ) , told reporters , “ The whole world framing outline ( cryptocurrency ) therefore ( government ) rather work normalization increasing regulation. ” The head FSS wrestled cryptocurrency regulation lack legislation industry time . He stated November 2017 “ supervision [ cryptocurrency exchanges ] come legal recognition digital tokens legitimate currency. ” Choe also warned bitcoin bubble December 2017 paired another warning month , stated , “ All warn people ’ see virtual currencies actual types currency , meaning step regulation now. ” The FSS , spearheading government ’ regulation cryptocurrency trading part larger task force , uphill battle face Korean officials ’ variable attitudes burgeoning industry . While FSS-led taskforce set nation ’ first official rules around cryptocurrency trading December 13 , 2017 , uncertainty around issues taxation regulation exchanges remained.January brought even less certainty peninsula South Korea ’ largest cryptocurrency exchanges raided police tax agencies January 10 , 2018 , kicking week contradiction top Korean officials precipitated market-wide meltdown known “ Red Tuesday ” January 16 , 2018.Choe state parliamentary hearing January 19 , 2018 , one FSS employee investigated “ suspicion traded digital currency ” ahead government ’ announcement toughening stance cryptocurrency trading . At hearing , Office Government Policy Coordination also disclosed probe two officials alleged profiteering government information events Red Tuesday.Korean officials rounded month January announcing January 23 , 2018 , anonymous accounts would banned trading cryptocurrencies January 30 , 2018.Merely three weeks ban anonymous accounts took effect , Choe seemed suggest rosier regulatory prospects cryptocurrency industry . These statements normalization came days sudden death Jung Ki-joon February 18 , 2018 . Jung , 52-year-old man led economic policy Office Government Policy Coordination instrumental spearheading January crackdown , died “ unknown ” causes home , though initial reports suggested ’ heart attack.If want see first hand cryptocurrency functions market outside speculative investing , right , Venezuela interesting place look. “ Venezuela could become case study repeated world certain conditions , ” said Jeffrey A. Tucker , editorial director American Institute Economic Research ( AIER ) , correspondence Bitcoin Magazine . “ Crypto escape hatch , way , tool emancipation . If power source , mine . If need save trade move wealth , crypto you. ” Crisis-Catalyzed CurrencyVenezuela economic recession decade . As result , government maintained strict control currency , Venezuelan bolivar ( VEF ) , since 2003.Venezuela ’ abundant resource oil . It fifth largest oil exporting country world , largest reserves non-conventional oil ( extra-heavy crude ) world . Ultimately , oil catalyzed Venezuela ’ cryptocurrency boom.Falling oil prices since 2014 spurred country ’ current economic depression . The government ’ response increase state control economy expense private sector . In 2017 , inflation Venezuelan bolivar ( VEF ) exceeded 650 percent . As exchange rate continued tumble , country ’ gross domestic product ( GDP ) contracted 12 percent end 2017. “ Many people leaving Venezuela . The country ’ enough money provide food , medicine necessities people , ” Venezuelan programmer aware cryptocurrency mining procedures Venezuela told Bitcoin Magazine interview , condition anonymity.Power MineIn economically desperate climate , cryptocurrency found one sustaining use cases immutable store value currency individuals trust government . The last two years seen enormous spike cryptocurrency earning mining , notably bitcoin.Because Venezuelan government subsidizes electricity past point negligibility , country become geopolitical hotspot mining . Antminer S9s popular computer used mine bitcoin Venezuela . They cost $ 3,000 ( plus shipping ) usually come China way covert middle country.According source ’ approximation , “ Having three S9 miners 30 cents month pay electricity . Three devices would one bitcoin-ish 10 months. ” The beginning price mining made effective way supplement income , two three devices per household , though many scaled operations point able independently support themselves. “ There must tens thousands people mining Venezuela , ” said Randy Brito , founder non-profit website BitcoinVenezuela.com . “ People earning cryptos , either mining working , usually use buy abroad — buy food , medicine , car parts , machinery parts ; common thing people buy foreign currencies platforms load cards use buy Amazon stores accept cards cryptos directly. ” In Venezuela , bitcoin commonly mined cryptocurrency first , still currently widely used . LocalBitcoins also given bitcoin advantage Venezuela trade cryptocurrencies ; able operate safely local exchanges ’ based within country.However , Brito also admitted Ethereum , Litecoin , Dash Bitcoin Cash well altcoins used often.According anonymous source , two main problems mining cryptocurrency Venezuela : In country national currency essentially value , people willing get currency value cost committing violent crimes ; government side.2017 : A Year Contradiction2017 particularly confusing uneasy time mine cryptocurrency Venezuela . The year began government authority crackdown large scale cryptocurrency mining operations.Miners jailed laundry list crimes : `` legitimacy capital , illicit enrichment , computer crimes , financing terrorism , exchange fraud damage national electricity system . `` By October 2017 , authorities even cracking small “ household ” mining operations . The congruity raids arrested miners could almost always get jail bribes fines , could never get equipment back.Brito ’ live Venezuela anymore , , self-described “ anarchocapitalist ” libertarian , still critical government.Most big mining farms thousands ASICs rigs run people close government , caught several devices , end raided devices subtracted . Regular people buy devices foreign currency saved acquire free ( black ) market , buy others import using bolivars inside country. “ Defaulted-Promise ” CoinsOn December 3 , 2017 , Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced Venezuelan government would create official cryptocurrency called Petro . He went highlight benefits cryptocurrency mining , introducing representative newly formed National Association Cryptocurrency Miners.Less two weeks later , however , police raids cryptocurrency mining operations proceeded though still illegal ever. “ We building Blockchain Observatory possibility registry exercising digital mining Venezuela . We want know , want know , want know equipment using . We want move toward regularization digital mining Venezuela , ” announced recently appointed superintendent cryptocurrency , Carlos Vargas , December 2017.In January 2018 , Venezuelan government opened online registration interested mining cryptocurrency legally . While Petro clearly main focus , authorities said involved program mine cryptocurrencies long approved state.There limited third-party confidence Petro ’ success . While cryptocurrency champions might say , “ Wait , decentralized token representing finite oil supply could interesting , done right , ” remain skeptical. “ It [ Petro ] backed nothing promise government already defaulted , ” said Brito.The government Spain preparing blockchain-friendly legislation including possible tax breaks attract companies emerging blockchain technology sector , Bloomberg Politics reports. “ We hope get legislation ready year , ” said MP Teodoro Garcia Egea , preparing comprehensive cryptocurrency-related bill . “ We want set Europe ’ safest framework invest ICOs. ” Initial Coin Offerings ( ICOs ) token sales one latest blockchain-related hot trends permitted several companies raise tens even hundreds millions dollars short space time , bypassing need prior regulatory approval.ICOs appealing speculators value successful token rise spectacularly , regulatory agencies , Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) U.S. , beginning clamp token sales , claiming crypto-tokens equivalent company shares traded stock market . According SEC , ICOs essentially Initial Public Offerings ( IPOs ) , subject similar regulations protection investors.At time , much regulation could stifle innovation push promising blockchain-based firms relocate less restrictive jurisdictions offshore . According Garcia Egea Popular Party , ruling political party Spain lawmaker belongs , ’ Spain ’ interest attract keep firms , , therefore , country adopt blockchain-friendly regulatory approach.Garcia Egea added bill preparation inspired existing blockchain-friendly regulatory frameworks enable Crypto Valley Switzerland . It could include ways attract investment blockchain technologies , threshold cryptocurrency investment ’ need reported regulator , specific regulations make attractive entrepreneurs use blockchain carry initial coin offerings , ICOs , financing tool.As shown series recent posts ( Spanish ) published personal website , Garcia Egea wants introduce whole range emerging technologies Spanish economy , including digital administration , cybersecurity , 3D printing blockchain technology.For example , Garcia Egea supports Alastria consortium focused establishment semi-public , permissioned national blockchain infrastructure digital identity system. “ Smart contracts , ensuring traceability unchangeability specific information , raising funds ICOs ( Initial Coin Offerings ) , etc . possible new network [ Alastria ] , ” said Garcia Egea ( translated writer ) . “ The time come establish legal framework individuals firms execute [ smart-contract based ] financial transactions protected secure way , using best available technology , ” added Garcia Egea . “ This provide legal security financial investments done channel , also place Spain privileged position attract capital , talent future-oriented projects , ecosystem upon build future internet value. ” It seems likely , Garcia Egea Popular Party manage convert vision law , Spain could become one crypto-havens Eurozone , could result many innovative technology developers ICO operators relocating Spain.Following remarks made Valdis Dombrovskis , vice president European Commission ( EC ) , roundtable cryptocurrencies , appears European Union ( EU ) prepared take steps toward regulating cryptocurrencies.While acknowledging European nations embrace blockchain technology order remain competitive financial markets , Dombrovskis also cautioned taking steps protect citizens hazards cryptocurrency space. “ Based assessment risks opportunities suitability existing regulatory framework instruments [ cryptocurrencies ICOs ] , Commission determine regulatory action EU level required. ” The EC roundtable focused three specific topics : Implications cryptocurrencies financial marketsRisks opportunities associated useThe recent development initial coin offerings ( ICOs ) Just last month , EC launched EU Blockchain Observatory Forum consolidate grow blockchain initiatives within EU . Over last couple months , warnings EU member states potential bitcoin bubble , conflicting statements regulating regulating cryptocurrencies come member states . Today ’ announcement roundtable seeks unify message feed upcoming Action Plan FinTech EU ’ position possible discussion G20 . There five major conclusions came session.The first point blockchain technology holds strong promise financial markets ; remain competitive , EU must embrace technology.Second , cryptocurrencies , deemed “ currencies traditional sense , ” become subject significant speculation , exposing consumers investors substantial risk losing investment.This second point leads third , warnings aforementioned risks consumers investors vital must clearly frequently stated across jurisdictions.Fourth , ICOs become creative method companies raise funding , opportunity also comes high risk investors due lack transparency regarding issuers ’ identities underlying business plans.Finally , EC needs assess circumstances existing regulation covers cryptocurrencies related services . This vary greatly depending circumstances around specific crypto-tokens , EC determine regulatory action required EU level.The EC proposes virtual currency exchanges wallet providers subject Anti-Money Laundering Directive . The Commission also suggests member states prepare rapid transposition legislation EC continues monitor markets changes might impact plans.On February 28 , 2018 , The Wall Street Journal reported SEC decided cap month way top U.S. financial regulator started : targeting ICOs . On Wednesday , Journal report stated “ scores ” subpoenas information requests sent demanding details structure sales pre-sales ICOs . While article specifically mentions SEC declined comment cites nebulous anonymous sources , probes reportedly sought subpoenas requests tech companies advisers involved digital tokens market.The SEC outright proclaiming stance ICOs unregistered securities . In July 2017 , report came concluding investigation DAO tokens , labeling digital assets securities . The U.S. regulator hinted , subtly , taking action ICOs generally . Prior year , however , actions taken ICOs , like shuttering Munchee ’ ICO halting AriseBank , usually linked idea ICOs scams meant defraud investors.The tenor SEC ’ stance broader ICO market appears changed , hinting regulator views ICOs unregistered securities violation U.S. Securities laws outright warning ICOs oncoming crackdown written oral testimony . That testimony delivered SEC Chair Jay Clayton February 6 , 2018 , Senate Committee hearing . During testimony , Chair noted , “ From I seen , initial coin offerings securities offerings . They interesting companies , much like stocks bonds , new label .

PPMs allow direct sales securities investors usually marketed accredited investors . Overstock announced release restated version PPM , initially dated December 18 , 2017 , 8K filing morning.According document , “ In February 2018 , Division Enforcement SEC informed [ tZERO ] conducting investigation matter Re : Overstock.com , Inc.

Pro Securities notified February 22 , 2018 , SEC conducting examination practices Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ) issued several document requests SpeedRoute , dating back December 2017.While industry may argue FUD ( Fear , Uncertainty , Doubt ) speculation media , SEC appears making good prior warnings . And Overstock ’ disclosures filing SEC show least one case warnings acted upon . In landmark development blockchain advancement , Wyoming ’ state legislature cleared known House Bill 70 ( HB 70 ) , exempts various types crypto assets securities laws . The bill originally passed Wyoming ’ House Representatives last month February 20 . It headed Governor Matt Mead signature.According public records , passed vote 27–3 , senators abstaining . This final vote , expected occur last week , held last minute discussion . Nevertheless , lawmakers completed work legislation exempt cryptocurrencies state money transmission laws . They also approved use blockchain-based records corporations.Through legislation , lawmakers hope carve-out space tech developers involved creation known “ utility tokens. ” The exemption would directed utility tokens marketed promoted investments able exchanged goods services.The first kind , HB 70 provides legal guidelines certain types cryptographic tokens accounted . And similar development , HB 19 , Bitcoin-friendly bill , also steadily making way Wyoming legislature . Also unanimously passed House , exempts cryptocurrencies state ’ money transmission laws.Wyoming ’ History Setting PrecedenceWyoming state known rugged individualism desire achieve “ first mover advantage ” key areas legislation . It often dubbed “ Equality State ” : first state grant women voting rights first state elect female governor.With respect business commerce , originated Limited Liability Company ( “ LLC ” ) 1977 . Today , nearly two-thirds businesses formed throughout U.S. choose LLC corporate entity format . LLCs formed state Wyoming par better-known Nevada Delaware corporations offering stellar asset protection.A Wyoming native former Wall Streeter , Caitlin Long , co-founder Wyoming Blockchain Coalition former chairman president enterprise blockchain company Symbiont , enthusiastic champion blockchain legislation.Long said email response Bitcoin Magazine : “ HB 70 one five blockchain bills supported Wyoming Blockchain Coalition , four already Governor ’ inbox ( fifth likely pass tomorrow ) . The Governor three days sign bills , take effect immediately signs . All five designed attract software companies move Wyoming , well attract businesses register Wyoming even ’ move there. ” According Long , HB 70 , coined `` utility token bill , '' represents first time world elected body recognized utility tokens distinct asset class neither security money . She said bill gives industry friendly state base operations , resolve federal regulatory questions utility token issuers . Regardless , said , help set precedence litigation influence federal policy.Long said two five bills designed cryptocurrency-friendly , exempting cryptocurrencies Wyoming ’ money transmitter laws property taxes . Wyoming , explained , already zero income taxes franchise taxes , bills quite friendly crypto businesses crypto owners want move state.Finally , pointed last two bills aimed attracting businesses register Wyoming , ranks third behind Delaware Nevada number new business registrations . She concluded : “ The race see state , Wyoming Delaware , first accept registrations blockchain form . Game , Delaware ! ” In sweeping crackdown yet , Japanese regulator penalized seven cryptocurrency exchanges , requiring two halt operations one month.Japan ’ Financial Services Agency ( FSA ) announced today , March 8 , 2018 , came exchanges due failure provide proper internal-control systems . All exchanges ordered step efforts improve security prevent money laundering.Business suspension orders issued FSHO Bit Station , effective today . The FSA said FSHO properly monitoring trades employees exchange undergone proper training . The FSA also alleged senior employee Bit Station used customers ’ bitcoin personal use.The five exchanges punished GMO Coin , Tech Bureau , Mister Exchange , Increments Coincheck . Coincheck served second business improvement order since security breach earlier year , $ 530 million worth NEM ( XEM ) tokens stolen.Coincheck Repay VictimsIn news conference today , Coincheck also announced begin compensating users cryptocurrency stolen , beginning soon next week . The exchange hacked January 26 , 2018 , hacker used malware gain access employee ’ computer.All 260,000 users impacted theft paid back Japanese yen , based NEM rates time theft , Tokyo-based company said.At root problem , cryptocurrency exchange keeping NEM hot wallet connected internet . In contrast , one time , U.S.-based exchange Coinbase keeps 98 percent funds secure cold wallet . The vice president NEM Foundation , Jeff McDonald , also told Bitcoin Magazine Coincheck using multisignature wallet , problem would occurred . It still clear behind Coincheck hack.Tough MeasuresThe Coincheck hack one largest thefts cryptocurrency world since Mt . Gox , another Tokyo exchange , brought knees hackers 2014 . What happened Coincheck highlighted risks storing funds cryptocurrency exchanges , since , Japan ’ FSA taken strong measures protect citizens ensure security cryptocurrency exchanges across country.Following Coincheck breach , Japanese authorities announced January 29 , 2018 , would investigate cryptocurrency exchanges country security gaps , ordered Coincheck , essentially , get act together.The FSA gave Coincheck February 13 , 2018 , submit report summarizing actions would take improve security customer support.Last year , Japan became one first countries regulate cryptocurrency exchanges set licensing system . Some 16 exchanges country currently registered , another 16 , including Coincheck , allowed continue operating unregistered apply licences . Five seven exchanges punished FSA unregistered , including two forced suspend business . Subsequent business suspension , Bit Station withdrew application license.Japan ’ crackdown exchanges follows series efforts U.S. regulators tighten reins industry . Yesterday , U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ( FinCEN ) proclaimed anyone selling initial coin offering ( ICO ) tokens unregistered money transmitters , U.S. Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) warned exchange selling tokens deemed securities must register agency . Overall , Japan remains one cryptocurrency-friendly countries , distinguishing crackdowns South Korea China.In six-page letter Dutch senate house , Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra outlined concerns rapid dramatic growth cryptocurrencies.Hoekstra emphasized little time understand react changing landscape current supervision regulatory framework ill equipped deal . Because cross-border nature technology markets , closing gaps requires unified approach across governments borders . The minister actively working European context , entire process take time coordination disparate governments agencies.Like policy makers , Hoekstra sees value promoting developing technology behind cryptocurrency , cryptography distributed ledger technology . However , addition concern fraud hacking , minister also expressed concern immature unregulated nature market better inform consumers potential risks.Hoekstra described following starting points assessment possible policies regulations control risks associated cryptocurrencies : Gaps consumer investor protection must true need closed , measures must proportionate.The integrity financial system must guaranteed.The innovative technique behind cryptocurrency must preserved , cryptography distributed ledger technology ( DLT ) .The cross-border nature cryptocurrencies requires one approach international level . National rules simply circumvented difficult maintain.The minister said given decentralized cross-border nature cryptocurrencies , ban feasible , important bring cryptocurrencies appropriate regulatory framework Dutch join French German finance ministers discuss cryptocurrency G20 context . The Netherlands wants play leading role European international approach cryptocurrency.In comments , Hoekstra stated , “ I hope usual process realization legislation regulations new rules enter force end 2019 . I foresee changes [ European Union ] Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive also contribute prevention tax evasion. ” This directive , took effect June 2017 , lays recent parameters standards adopted EU prevent money-laundering terrorist funding.He sees change helping prevent use cryptocurrency purposes tax evasion well . While letter policy , reflect direction The Netherlands , Europe much world appear headed in.New York State Assembly legislator Ron Kim ( D-40 ) unveiled bill intends protect cryptocurrency investors ease bureaucratic burden crypto-related businesses . It ’ first comprehensive cryptocurrency bill New York make past studies commissions hands legislative branch . Kim introduced legislation March 13 , 2018 , met blockchain industry leaders subject.Known The New York Cryptocurrency Exchange Act ( A9899 ) , bill relates “ audit cryptocurrency business activity third party depositories prohibits licensing fees conduct cryptocurrency business activity. ” If take effect , legislation would make amendments Section 9 New York ’ Banking Law . With addition section 9-x , law would mandate cryptocurrency business entity subject routine audits public third-party depository service . These audits would require individuals businesses alike safeguard assets proper security measures , provide adequate insurance account holder assets produce proof-of-asset ownership.Any entity full compliance receive digital New York Seal Approval reassure consumers outlet trustworthy secure . This seal would ideally replace BitLicenses currently issued New York State Department Financial Services , away fee-based license favor one earned audit.Kim believes earlier efforts regulate space put enormous burdens businesses trying grow operate cryptocurrency space . “ What New York needs , ” told Bitcoin Magazine , “ common-sense laws security procedures provide degree clarity businesses public . This legislation give consumers companies confidence needed widespread adoption cryptocurrency New York. ” While bill first kind New York legislators , ’ Kim ’ first foray cryptocurrency . As precursor landmark legislation , Kim recently published brief report titled “ The Future Bitcoin NY. ” His research identifies unregulated exchanges “ weak point ” blockchain ecosystem . This vulnerability , coupled cost BitLicense , left New York lacking legitimate crypto-companies consumer confidence.According statement Kim ’ office , currently fewer 10 BitLicense holders entire state New York , even though 1,000 active job postings New York blockchain industry . It ’ Kim ’ hope new legislation foster friendlier environment companies space ; one attract business generate increased revenue connecting consumers reliable , state-vetted entities.Throughout 2017 , United States government remained relatively quiet subject cryptocurrencies blockchain . While countries beginning outline clear regulations legislative guidelines , U.S. investors ears filled conflicting talk SEC , CFTC various state legislatures.So far , however , ’ busy year United State ’ regulatory efforts , federal state levels , The New York Cryptocurrency Exchange Act yet another installment growing series litigation finally broaches topic cryptocurrency regulations . If anything , legislation may set precedent consumer protections industry , well lenient regulatory approach might encourage job growth industry.On March 14 , 2018 , House Financial Committee held hearing entitled “ Examining Cryptocurrencies ICO Markets. ” This first hearing members U.S. Congress , specifically subcommittee capital markets , securities ICO markets , addressed cryptocurrencies ICOs . Witnesses hearing included Dr. Chris Brummer , Professor Law Georgetown University Law Center ; Mike Lempres , chief legal risk officer Coinbase ; Robert Rosenblum , partner Silicon Valley law firm Wilson Sonseni Goodrich & Rosati ; Peter Van Valkenburgh , director research Coin Center.The hearing addressed economic efficiencies potential capital formation opportunities cryptocurrencies ICOs offer businesses investors . It also reviewed current approach SEC , CFTC state regulators administer laws adequately protect investors . Because regulatory clarity far difficult businesses investors , members Congress also expressed interest best monitor oversee blockchain technology moves future.Notable points asked addressed witnesses included need security investor compliance U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges ; need ( Rosenblum ’ case , lack thereof ) regulators distinguish difference cryptocurrencies considered digitally scarce commodities securities tokens ; need establish harmonization among “ patchwork ” regulatory agencies dictating move forward ; policing cryptocurrencies , way ’ stifle domestic innovation forcing investors businesses leave country.Digitally Scarce Commodities Security TokensDistinguishing major cryptocurrencies majority ICO tokens biggest topic conversation hearing.Van Valkenburgh noted digital scarcity fundamental difference ICOs cryptocurrencies Bitcoin , Ethereum Filecoin. “ The fundamental innovation Bitcoin digital scarcity . That digital scarcity employed innovative people variety innovative purposes . A token scarce transferable person person used like money , good throughout history gold seashells . A scarce token also automatically redeemable digital good computing service provided network computing participants verify blockchain . These projects like Ethereum , Filecoin Blockstack beginning compete competitors like Amazon , Facebook Google . A scarce token also represent legal agreement. ” Van Valkenburgh went distinguish scarce tokens already put practice others merely theoretical , supported blockchain software yet built . Recently , new blockchain projects raised money selling promise future tokens willing investors ICOs.From regulatory standpoint fundamental distinction must made scarce tokens exist blockchain used payment obtain computing services , hand , promises future tokens representing hopefully profitable efforts developer.He went state former scarce tokens like digital commodities latter ( ICOs ) securities , distinct risks must addressed investors different ways.Rosenblum suggested short– long-term approach SEC agencies modify regulation rules around cryptocurrencies industry get locked concrete regulatory system early . He used combination blockchain technology artificial intelligence convey imposing regulations time would good idea : It could potentially lead new marketing , business opportunities , scientific sociological advances . However , opportunity use technology manipulative conduct , data breach nefarious conduct really hard predict right now.On subject regulating ICOs , Brummer emphasized need standardized precise promoter disclosures investor protection . Speaking primarily cryptocurrency white papers , essentially business technological plan behind cryptocurrency , Brummer gave list recommended standardized disclosures : Location : Brummer cited one particular study indicated 32 percent ICOs possible identify identity origin ICO issuer promoter . Without information difficult investors understand protection rights authorities contact case fraud . Therefore , ICO promoters issuers establish clear statement issuer located.Problem proposed technology solution : The important information assessing success ICO understanding proposed solution technology solve problem : plain-English explanation technology solution . More technical aspects white paper would subject validation third-party technology audit . All code would subject public repository GitHub.Token proposal : An ICO ’ white paper disclose legal rights token holders well tokens traded platforms.Brummer concluded saying white papers also disclose basic principles blockchain governance risk factors , token , also industry whole.Brummer stated one major point contention government regulators cryptocurrencies might fact “ digital things tend abstract therefore tend harder understand , ” tension difficulty defining commodities , unlike gold “ shiny universally identified something value. ” Huizenga , turn , acknowledged “ governmental bureaucracies tend view world lenses . And I think certain governmental responsibility protect investors. ” A Patchwork Regulatory AgenciesWhile distinguishing digitally scarce commodity security appeared fundamental pressing issue , testifying witnesses acknowledged need clear lines regulatory agencies operate monitor industry . This confusing often contradictory relationship SEC vetting cryptocurrencies , CFTC policing cryptocurrencies spot market , state regulators already indicated level disorder could potentially stymie development within domestic cryptocurrency blockchain technology industry.Again , Van Valkenburgh reiterated policymakers get distinction digitally scarce commodity tokens security tokens wrong , cede leadership technology development rest world.Rosenblum suggested , moving forward , “ regulation enforcement , area complicated dynamic , appropriate way regulate . Enforcement clearly necessary ; however , need clearer guidelines SEC ’ registration , market trading investment rules apply apply , something regulation enforcement. ” Security ComplianceCongressman Hultgren expressed concern cybersecurity standards within cryptocurrency . Addressing concerns , Lempres stated , “ Approximately 99 percent Coinbase cryptocurrency holdings held cold storage. ” Furthermore , 20 percent Coinbase ’ employees dedicated compliance . Lempres also pointed blockchain ’ transparent ledger allows Coinbase glean insight bad activity occurring within system . Lempres also referred cybersecurity standards state New York ’ “ BitLicenses. ” So far BitLicenses administered four cryptocurrency companies — including Coinbase — strongest evidence security standardization , according Lempres.Voices For AgainstVoicing disapproval cryptocurrency , one direct Congressman Brad Sherman . “ Cryptocurrencies popular guys like sit pajamas tell wives going millionaires . They help terrorists criminals move money around world . Tax evaders . They help startup companies commit fraud , take money , one percent time actually create useful business. ” Sherman went suggest cryptocurrency hurts U.S. dollar , prevents federal government preventing tax evasion , takes away investment could otherwise used develop American economy . Chairman Huizenga noted , despite Sherman ’ comments , hearing focus cryptocurrency blockchain technology Dodd Frank reform.On hand , Rep. Tom Emmer , member Congressional Blockchain Caucus , suggested potential innovation blockchain technology American society something Republicans Democrats welcome.I tend trust people believe ’ things good , ’ trying improve lives hopefully lives people around — old adage rising tide lifts boats . And yet I hear elected officials ’ concept ’ dealing exciting , talking got regulate create government infrastructure . I respectfully disagree ’ act wet blanket amazing new technology . I realize regulation , ’ got balance.The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ( FinCEN ) appears taking steps eliminate ambiguity surrounding status ICOs money services businesses ( MSBs ) . On March 6 , 2018 , FinCEN released letter sent February U.S . Senator Ron Wyden ( “ Wyden Letter ” ) . The letter stakes policy position could seen somewhat inconsistent prior FinCEN guidance could foreshadow potential avenues enforcement . ICOs would wise monitor FinCEN ’ public statements , ’ already , consider developing Bank Secrecy Act compliance programs protect substantial fines criminal liability associated FinCEN actions.In Wyden Letter , FinCEN ostensibly reiterates position virtual currency developers businesses sell virtual currency Money Services Businesses ( specifically money transmitters ) Bank Secrecy Act “ must comply AML/CFT requirements apply type MSB. ” Ambiguities ContradictionsWhile FinCEN frames Wyden letter reiteration previous position , application Bank Secrecy Act ICO activities less clear FinCEN claims Wyden Letter due previously issued interpretive rulings.In 2013 Guidance ( FIN-2013-G001 “ Application FinCEN ’ Regulations Persons Administering , Exchanging , Using Virtual Currencies ” ) , FinCEN stated “ person creates units convertible virtual currency sells units another person real currency equivalent engaged transmission another location money transmitter. ” However , later interpretive ruling , FIN-2014-R001 ( referred “ Mining Ruling ” ) , FinCEN appeared partially contravene statement 2013 Guidance.In Mining Ruling , FinCEN addressed questions regarding virtual currency miner ’ use mined virtual currency seemed indicate analysis business ’ use token primary factor determining application Bank Secrecy Act opposed origin token.The Mining Ruling suggested long token sold person business ’ uses , payment debts make distributions shareholders , person business would deemed “ user ” virtual currency rather “ exchanger ” “ administrator ” virtual currency. “ Users ” virtual currency MSBs , “ exchangers ” “ administrators ” MSBs 2013 Guidance . This interpretation Mining Ruling somewhat undercut Ripple Labs enforcement action ( settled via agreement Ripple ) , additional formal guidance interpretative rulings FinCEN limit reject extension reasoning Mining Ruling ICO activities.FinCEN address discrepancies 2013 Guidance Mining Ruling Wyden Letter , letter cite Mining Ruling footnote . Confusingly , FinCEN ’ footnote summary Mining Ruling seems inconsistent conclusions drawn full analysis . It may FinCEN attempting square circle choosing categorize developers “ administrators ” virtual currency anytime conduct sale tokens regardless use proceeds.Considerations ICOsWhile Wyden Letter formal interpretative ruling formal guidance , letter seen warning current ICOs prospective ICOs FinCEN paying attention expects full compliance Bank Secrecy Act.If FinCEN acts according interpretation set forth Wyden Letter , ICOs choose chosen fully comply substantive requirements Bank Secrecy Act ( including registration MSB ) , could face serious consequences including criminal liability extensive fines.Token developers consult legal counsel consultants develop Bank Secrecy Act compliance plan part ICO offering . Some requirements well-designed compliance plan ( ) conducting risk assessment ; ( ii ) developing effective anti-money laundering program ; ( iii ) appointing compliance officer ; ( iv ) engaging know-your-customer activities ; ( v ) complying recordkeeping reporting requirements ; ( vi ) registering FinCEN money transmitter.These activities represent significant , important , additional investment developers ready tokens applications prospective users.On final note , Wyden Letter address application limitations exemptions Bank Secrecy Act . ICOs may wish consult legal counsel analyze plans raising capital associated tokens determine options best them.When comes bitcoin cryptocurrencies , Mark Carney , governor Bank England chairman Financial Stability Board ( FSB ) , known harsh critic . Though Carney praised technology behind cryptocurrency past , often referred digital money “ bubble , ” claiming failed users “ substitute cash ” credit cards. “ The time come hold crypto-asset ecosystem standards rest financial system , ” Carney told CNBC early March 2018 , stating “ average volatility top ten cryptocurrencies market capitalization 25 times U.S. equities market 2017. ” Just days ago , Carney proclaimed illicit activities surrounding cryptocurrencies causes major concern , citing everything personal wallet thefts terrorist funding , , appears sentiment suddenly changed.Less 24 hours scheduled speak year ’ G20 meeting , Carney seemingly reversed stance digital currencies , saying pose serious risks financial stability . Carney Board published official letter March 18 , eve summit , stating : “ The FSB ’ initial assessment crypto-assets pose risks global financial stability time … Their small size , fact substitutes currency limited use real economy financial transactions , meant linkages rest financial system limited. ” Carney , whose term Bank England ends 2019 , also insinuated whoever succeeds position likely run “ open ” operation , concentrating reviewing current rules regulations , rather implementing strenuous standards. “ As work fix fault lines caused financial crisis closes , FSB increasingly pivoting away design new policy initiatives toward dynamic implementation rigorous evaluation effects agreed G20 reforms , ” said.The G20 summit began March 19 , 2018 , last March 21 . Several economic leaders gathering Buenos Aires discuss cryptocurrencies future planet ’ financial infrastructure.Despite Carney ’ newfound attitude toward digital assets , every nation agrees cryptocurrencies ’ hazardous . Some countries , like France , Germany Japan , calling regulation , Central Bank Germany stating bitcoin regulated “ global scale. ” France Germany allegedly creating joint proposal cryptocurrency regulation representatives present year ’ summit.Carney , , explained pursuing “ balanced approach ” toward cryptocurrencies , financial system likely mold change understood : “ The market continues evolve rapidly , initial assessment could change crypto-assets become significantly widely used interconnected core regulated financial system. ” Still , seems virtual currency advocates something celebrate since , aside lenient stance coins , Carney feels technology behind cryptocurrency potential enhance assist economy needed.After facing crackdowns China issued warning regulators Japan , cryptocurrency exchange Binance seeking home crypto-friendly island nation Malta , company ’ CEO Zhao Changpeng told Bloomberg . Malta known extending open arms fintech blockchain technology . Malta Prime Minister Joseph Muscat underscored policy shared Bloomberg piece Twitter , stating , “ We aim global trailblazers regulation blockchain-based businesses jurisdiction quality choice world class fintech companies. ” Since founded Hong Kong 2017 , Binance grown rapidly become largest exchange world trading volume . Establishing Malta could open doors even larger growth . Currently , exchange negotiating banks Malta set formal banking partnership , Zhao told Bloomberg.If succeeds , means Binance , offers crypto-to-crypto trading pairs , able offer crypto-to-fiat trading pairs . In sense , Binance would operate similar U.S.-based exchange Coinbase , users direct links bank accounts withdraw deposit fiat.Banking relationships essential livelihood exchanges . Without ability allow customers move fiat world , exchanges turn stable tokens , like tether ( USDT ) trueUSD ( TUSD ) , fiat alternative protect market volatility . But stablecoins present class problems . For instance , necessarily clear backed real dollars.Despite , Malta may quiet home Binance looking . In April 2017 , Malta rolled ambitious strategy blockchain technology push small Mediterranean country become “ Silicon Valley ” Europe . Currently , Malta process setting Malta Digital Innovation Authority certify blockchain companies establish legal framework initial coin offerings ( ICOs ) . Malta among several small European countries , including Lithuania Belarus , creating fintech-friendly regulatory environments capture larger role growing blockchain financial technology space.Japan ’ top securities regulator issued formal warning cryptocurrency exchange Binance needs comply licensing requirements order continue operations.The news , Financial Services Agency ( FSA ) published statement Friday , March 23 , 2018 , confirms earlier rumors reported news outlet Nikkei FSA warning forthcoming , given exchange already operating country without license.Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao initially took Twitter deny rumors , accusing Nikkei “ irresponsible journalism. ” He stated Binance communication FSA . “ It make sense JFSA tell newspaper telling us , active dialog going them. ” But FSA warning became public , tweeted , “ We received simple letter JFSA hour ago . Our lawyers called JFSA immediately , find solution. ” In attempt quell customer concerns , later tweeted , “ No need worry . Some negative news often turn positive long term. ” Binance , based Hong Kong , expanding operations Japan , employing several staff country . At time , according Nikkei , exchange failing perform proper identity checks Japanese investors opened accounts exchange . It likely many investors lured Binance domestic exchanges lower fees offered exchange.In 2017 , Japan became one first countries regulate cryptocurrency exchanges set licensing system . Now , cryptocurrency exchanges licensed FSA licenses pending allowed operate country.Following incident earlier year $ 530 million worth NEM tokens stolen Tokyo exchange Coincheck due lax security measures , FSA doubled oversight . Earlier month , FSA penalized seven exchanges due failure provide proper internal control systems.So far , Japan 16 licensed cryptocurrency exchanges . Next month , exchanges plan form self-regulating body work FSA establish enforce best practices within industry , including setting guidelines ICOs.Launched summer 2017 , Binance raised money operations issuing initial coin offering ( ICO ) . It since grown become one busiest exchanges 24-hour trading volume $ 1.9 billion . Binance lists 118 actively trading coins support fiat pairs . Instead , supports tether ( USDT ) , stable coin pegged dollar . Recently , Binance announced plans launch public blockchain serve foundation decentralized exchange dubbed Binance Chain.According Bloomberg , Binance plans move staff Malta order avoid clashing regulators.Compliance Anti-Money Laundering ( AML ) rules economic sanctions administered Treasury Department ’ Office Foreign Assets Control ( OFAC ) daunting task business . When comes fast-moving world token sales cryptocurrencies general , much legal regulatory landscape yet settled , obligation comply AML OFAC laws clear . This quick start guide AML OFAC compliance aims provide entrepreneurs in-house counsel early roadmap planning reaching compliance goals think kicking token sale.This guide focuses U.S. laws , aware countries also laws two areas.Steer Clear Tainted Funds : Watch Red FlagsIt states obvious , course , say steer clear tainted funds . But whether starting new cryptocurrency exchange business selling tokens raise money new project , takes intentional focus care ensure funds moving business product illegal activity . With several recent notorious examples theft , fraud money laundering fresh minds government regulators investigators , even imperative entrepreneurs establish use right anti-money laundering procedures front.Whether business model planned token sale requires formal anti-money laundering program place , always required avoid conducting transactions involving criminal proceeds . Among others things , federal anti-money laundering laws prohibit following types financial transactions : Concealment Promotion Money Laundering , 18 U.S.C . § 1956 ( ) ( 1 ) : This statute prohibits transaction proceeds crime person knows property involved comes form unlawful activity , even person know precise nature underlying criminal activity . To violation law , must intent part person conducting transaction — often proven circumstantial evidence — conceal true nature , location , source , ownership control funds , reinvest “ promote ” future criminal activity.International Money Laundering , 18 U.S.C . § 1956 ( ) ( 2 ) : This law applies even “ clean ” funds currently proceeds criminal activity sent internationally “ promote ” certain categories criminal activity.Money Spending Statute , 18 U.S.C . § 1957 : Applicable transactions criminal proceeds $ 10,000 , law simply prohibits transactions participant ( including currency exchangers , money transmitters , brokers dealers securities commodities ) knows funds unlawful source.Money Laundering Conspiracy , 18 U.S.C . § 1956 ( h ) : Two individuals intend conduct transaction criminal proceeds may liable foreseeable offenses committed co-conspirators furtherance scheme.Not offenses subject criminal civil prosecution , proceeds criminal activity , well property “ involved ” money-laundering offense — may include things non-tainted funds account , commissions fees , websites even entire business — subject criminal civil forfeiture.In environment , , enough , example , require buyer tokens represent writing funds paying “ clean ” ? Maybe , maybe . If buyer makes representation red flags around transaction suggesting otherwise , representations insulate liability.As discuss , business model puts category money services business , need take additional steps . If , still want make sure know understand customer transaction ; lookout transaction details customary ; keep records due diligence.You May Need Register Money Services BusinessProbably significant question need answer relation anti-money laundering obligations prepare undertake token sale whether sale amounts “ money transmitting ” federal law . Be aware “ money transmitters ” also highly regulated state ’ laws , many require advance licensure ; however , state money transmitting laws typically aimed consumer protection rather anti-money laundering , address issue state regulation note uniform licensing scheme across 50 states.Under federal law , “ financial institutions , ” include “ money transmittersx ” ( category “ money services businesses ” ) , regulated Bank Secrecy Act , 31 U.S.C . 5311 , et seq. , subject number specific requirements defined overseen Treasury Department ’ Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ( FinCEN ) . According FinCEN , “ money transmitting services ” means : acceptance currency , funds , value substitutes currency one person transmission currency , funds , value substitutes currency another location person means.FinCEN issued guidance 2013 making clear views money-transmitting regulations applying “ persons creating , obtaining , distributing , exchanging , accepting transmitting virtual currencies. ” With regard token issuers using decentralized network , FinCEN concluded anyone qualifies virtual currency “ exchanger ” money transmitter.Even specifically , formal industry guidance , letter responding Member Congress ( became public early March issued February 13 , 2018 ) , FinCEN expressed view initial coin offerings ( “ ICOs ” ) qualify money transmitting , stating : A developer sells convertible virtual currency , including form ICO coins tokens , exchange another type value substitutes currency money transmitter must comply AML/ [ Combating Financing Terrorism ] requirements apply [ MSBs ] .Importantly , entities individuals follow rules operate unlicensed money transmitting business subject criminal prosecution 18 U.S.C . § 1960 . Yet , complicate matters , FinCEN ’ letter also noted ICO involving securities derivatives might instead subject authority Securities Exchange Commission Commodity Futures Trading Commission , separate — although similar — AML/CFT requirements.Ultimately , whether need register FinCEN money transmitter going depend specific facts circumstances token sale business model , want consider question carefully.If You Are Money Services Business , Special AML Requirements ApplyIf money transmitter subject FinCEN ’ regulations , subject number specific requirements . First , must register money-transmitting business within 180 days date business established maintain list agents working . Most broadly , money transmitters required : develop , implement maintain effective anti-money laundering program , reasonably designed prevent money services business used facilitate money laundering financing terrorist activities.Additionally , subject number reporting record-keeping requirements , particularly requirement file Suspicious Activity Reports , SARs , transactions $ 2,000 appear involve funds illicit activity ; designed evade reporting requirements Bank Secrecy Act ; serve apparent lawful business purpose.To meet AML requirements , money transmitters must formal AML compliance program includes following four elements : 1 ) written policies procedures ; 2 ) designated AML compliance officer ; 3 ) independent review monitoring AML program ; 4 ) training program relevant personnel regarding AML responsibilities.Finally , may possible assign responsibilities AML program founder , manager employee duties business currently support stand-alone function , keep mind critical function resourced , importantly , free influence business sales side organization.Operating money transmitting business without meeting requirements established Bank Secrecy Act could subject business individuals involved civil criminal penalties.Do You Have Foreign Partners Corporate Customers ? Take These Extra StepsMany participants cryptocurrency token sale marketplace based outside United States . If FinCEN refers foreign “ agents ” — term uses include “ authorized delegates , foreign agents counterparties , agents sub-agents ” — AML program must meet additional requirements.For example , contractual arrangement make tokens available foreign company customers foreign company ’ software platform , must : conduct due diligence foreign agents counterparties ; consider number particular risk factors risk-based monitoring agents counterparties ; anddevelop implement policy corrective action termination non-compliant entities.While may able contractually allocate responsibility developing policies , procedures internal controls agent counterparty , remain liable ensure fully operational.OFAC Compliance : An AML Program Is Not EnoughEvery U.S. person business required avoid engaging financial transactions certain individuals , entities countries subject U.S. economic sanctions . Accordingly , offer tokens sale public private offering , obligation ensure none purchasers list prohibited individuals entities maintained Treasury Department ’ Office Foreign Assets Control ( OFAC ) . You also need sure customers business partners based countries subject broader economic sanctions , list currently includes Cuba , Iran , North Korea , Syria Crimean region Ukraine.Compliance economic sanctions programs administered OFAC compliance AML laws established Bank Secrecy Act often considered breath . And , effective OFAC screening AML programs certainly areas overlap , namely robust customer identification procedure , two separate distinct programs responsibilities separate procedures each.OFAC compliance involves screening names individuals entities highly complex often-changing list sanctioned parties , countries regions . Most companies make use third-party servicers conduct screening behalf , prudent due diligence ensure service providers sophistication required capture potential prohibited transactions.Can shortcut process simply token buyer represent OFAC sanctions list ? While representations helpful , sufficient . Unlike risk-based compliance expectations , AML requirements , strictly liable OFAC screening failures OFAC pursue even minor violations.Nonetheless , found violated economic sanctions laws , strength OFAC compliance program , along state mind factors , considered determination penalty.Be Ready Demonstrate Your AML OFAC ComplianceAs business , operating cryptocurrency space , prepared questions regulator investigator jurisdiction activity . Whether money transmitter formal written AML program , one first demands likely receive federal state inquiry produce copy AML program policies well customer identification procedures screening protocols.Examiners investigators looking whether taken time recognize identify risk factors risk categories counterparties business . And look see whether developed procedures intended mitigate risks avoid conducting transactions blocked parties illicit funds . If equipped written AML guidance OFAC screening processes , including clear allocation responsibility within company ensuring compliance , good start.There Is Room InnovationFederal agencies involved regulating overseeing marketplace token sales recognize value society emerging technologies behind activity , even scrambling catch technology institutional level . While burden new company meeting legal regulatory requirements AML OFAC compliance insignificant , prior planning areas protect investment time resources create room greater innovation.Twitter fast player . Less two weeks ago , social media giant announced developing new policies would lead eventual ban cryptocurrency ICO-related advertisements platform . Bitcoin enthusiasts everywhere likely figured little time spare , changes ’ expected take effect sometime April earliest.In addition , reported Twitter would also banning ads cryptocurrency exchanges , though would allegedly exceptions rule.Executive speculation reached end , ban cryptocurrency marketing strategies takes full effect March 27 , 2018 . Twitter third major internet mogul announce ban Google Facebook , first implement , leading questions whether industry could damaged long term. “ We committed ensuring safety Twitter community , ” enterprise confirmed The Verge statement . “ As , added new policy Twitter Ads related cryptocurrency . Under new policy , advertisement Initial Coin Offerings ( ICOs ) token sales prohibited globally. ” Twitter also said end campaigns cryptocurrency exchanges digital wallet services. “ We know type content often associated deception fraud , organic paid , proactively implementing several signals prevent types accounts engaging others deceptive manner , ” company said Bloomberg.Following announcement , bitcoin ’ price fell 7 percent . At press time , currency trading approximately $ 7,900 — $ 700 less stood weekend March 25.Speaking TechCrunch , Twitter representative said company “ continue improve upon ” new policies “ industry evolves. ” Twitter ’ attitude actions toward cryptocurrencies undoubtedly led pain success arena . Only weeks ago , company began removing accounts felt impersonating portfolios personalities notable cryptocurrency figures , Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin John McAfee . This ultimately led serious problems , like real people — impersonators — banned instead.At time , however , Twitter ’ CEO Jack Dorsey offered bitcoin highest praise recent years . In interview The Times , Dorsey confidently exclaimed within 10 years , bitcoin would likely stand world ’ “ single ” currency , fiat forms virtual money would become obsolete nonexistent. “ The world ultimately single currency , ” stated . “ The internet single currency . I personally believe bitcoin. ” He later commented bitcoin presently means serve “ effective ” cash , citing slow transaction speeds , costly trading fees general volatility main issues overcome , though believe public garner greater access bitcoin future technology behind improves.Two Japanese cryptocurrency exchanges closing operations . This adds three exchanges country closing doors regulators stepped oversight wake late-January hack Tokyo-based Coincheck , $ 530 million NEM tokens vanished.According revised payment services laws went force April 2017 , Japan made bitcoin nationally accepted cryptocurrency , virtual currency exchange wants business country solicit citizens needs licensed Japan ’ Financial Services Agency ( FSA ) .As reported Nikkei , Tokyo GateWay Mr. Exchange withdrawing applications register exchange operators . Both companies must return customers ’ cash cryptocurrency holdings close . Mr. Exchange among issued orders March 8 , 2018 , improve data security safeguards.The FSA began issuing first licenses September 2017 . So far , 16 exchanges fully licensed . Another 16 , including Coincheck , allowed continue operating “ quasi-operators ” undetermined amount time bring safety standards date . Quasi-operator special category relegated exchanges started businesses registration system put place . Since , FSA grappling deal quasi-operators . After Coincheck theft , FSA doubled began on-the-spot checks quasi-operators make sure taking proper measures protect customers . Since operators little hope meeting agency 's standards , FSA given option step ordering so.So far , among 16 quasi-operating status , Raimu , bitExpress , BitStation , Tokyo GateWay Mr. Exchange bowed voluntarily . Earlier month , FSA ordered BitStation along FSHO suspend operations month dealt compliance issues . Last week , Binance , largest exchange 24-hour trading volume , also issued warning FSA , begun operations Japan without license . Binance , originally based Hong Kong , seeking relocate Malta , although says also working Japanese regulators remedy situation meantime.Japan learned lesson need setting systems oversee cryptocurrency exchanges Tokyo-based exchange Mt . Gox collapsed February 2014 , reportedly losing 850,000 bitcoins ( worth $ 6.7 billion today ) . At time , Mt . Gox largest virtual currency exchange world.On March 19 , 2018 , op-ed published French news website , Numerama , France ’ Minister Finance Economics , Bruno Le Maire wrote appears , least first glance , uncharacteristically optimistic exposition profound pioneering nature cryptocurrency blockchain technology : “ A revolution underway , bitcoin precursor . The blockchain offer new opportunities startups , example Initial Coin Offerings ( ICO ) allow raise funds ‘ tokens , ’ crypto-actives . It promises create network trust without intermediaries , offer increased traceability transactions , overall , make economy efficient. ” The op-ed message French public emerging technology agent change — disruptive beneficial . According Le Maire , blockchain technology cryptocurrencies “ could upset daily practices banking insurance sectors , financial markets , also patents certified acts. ” He goes warn echoed leaders nations , anticipated consequences traditional players. “ Let ’ mere spectators : become actors revolution , ” urged . Le Maire goes state France ’ policy benevolent yet cautious . He expressed weariness chaotic nature decentralization questioning speculative products , investor security ever-present possibility technology could used launder fund criminal activities. “ Clarifying law attract innovation , identify risks without hindering ecosystem , 's approach , ” wrote Le Maire . He goes advocate former French central bank governor , Jean-Pierre Landau , assigned investigate cryptocurrencies formulate proposal navigable regulatory framework.The op-ed concludes , “ Il ’ agit là du rôle de la France : Être force de proposition pour construire le monde de demain , ” loosely translates , “ This role France : Be proactive building world tomorrow . `` Blockchain BisqueLe Maire ’ op-ed uncharacteristic two reasons . First , news website , Numerama plays audience favor open source movement . Founded Ratiatum 2002 , publication originally focused peer-to-peer culture-related topics rebranded Numerama . While Numerama said defend “ free-sharing culture ” “ respect privacy , ” reader ( Mmastoc ) complained comments section mismatch Numerama blunted public-announcement style Le Maire ’ op-ed , “ For pity ’ sake , I beg , government soup. ” The sentiment repeated way several commentators ; point , publication critical centralized authority Numerama publishing public message cryptocurrency adoption central government gives overly optimistic , artificial incomplete , view government policy.The reason op-ed comes across ineffectual vague optimism toward less cryptocurrency regulation . Based happened earlier year France nations , Le Maire ’ cryptocurrency policy , association French government ’ , tended lean hard toward heavier regulation.For instance , Jean-Pierre Landau — central banker Le Maire advocates op-ed entrusted build regulatory framework cryptocurrency — notable Bitcoin skeptic denounced cryptocurrency back 2014 op-ed Financial Times . Landau ’ argument currencies need central banks successful adjustments monetary supply made ; therefore , bitcoin ’ scarcity ( small supply ) insufficient satisfy demand , result , economy whole.While might clear Landau thinks four years later , Le Maire appointed Landau lead working group purpose regulating cryptocurrencies back middle January 2018.G20 DiscussionsShortly Le Maire ’ op-ed , world leaders met Argentina G20 Summit , specifically , greatest event cryptocurrency regulation far 2018 . Despite changing views Mike Carney , governor Bank England chairman Financial Stability Board ( FSB ) , eased cryptocurrencies , France advocated regulatory framework cryptocurrencies pursuing Germany . This cooperation evidence call German central banks effective regulation virtual currencies international scale opinion shared many French authorities.These developments , doubt , linked increased regulatory focus cryptocurrencies countries China , South Korea U.S. Future cryptocurrency regulation almost certainly require international cooperation move forward , given recent developments cross-border attributes cryptocurrency general.The G20 ultimately determined cryptocurrencies regulated property , though likely regulated unique asset class time moves . World leaders also left G20 agreed upon notion effective regulations place July 2018.French Liberty ? If France recently decided cultivate suitable environment cryptocurrency , credit due large part Laure de La Raudière . Raudière republican represents Eure-et-Loir department National Assembly France ( lower house bicameral parliament France ) .She also appointed early February lead National Assembly ’ “ Mission ’ information. ” The purpose mission investigate blockchain technology France abroad produce reports inform legislators topics related technology used regulated . The mission expected take six seven months since February , meaning wrapping around time G20 world leaders reconvene regulation consensus.Though French authorities appear determined let technological innovation cryptocurrencies blockchain technology pass , time tell inevitably fit global regulation spectrum . L ’ Autorité des Marchés Financiers ( AMF ) also gone specific cryptocurrency players registered AMF.In article February , Raudière quoted stating something much optimistic yet , less vague , To avoid mis-legislating , understand . I always enrolled approach technology education , focusing highlighting repercussions prohibition technology . For example , time HADOPI debate , amendments aimed banning peer-to-peer technology ; revealed total misunderstanding technology used achieve illegal things also accomplish extremely positive things.Most time , 's technology ban , way 's used.In amounts major clampdown bitcoin cryptocurrencies , Reserve Bank India ( RBI ) announced press release today , April 5 , 2018 , banning banks regulated financial entities dealing digital currencies. “ In view associated risks , decided , immediate effect , entities regulated RBI shall deal provide services individual business entities dealing settling [ virtual currencies ] , ” India ’ central bank said . What means banks longer able transfer money crypto wallet exchange . Regulated entities already providing services three months wind cryptocurrency-related operations , RBI Deputy Governor BP Kanungo told reporters media briefing Thursday . At time , India given idea issuing virtual currency . `` While many central banks still engaged debate , inter-departmental group constituted Reserve Bank study provide guidance desirability feasibility introduce central bank digital currency , ” central bank said , adding report would ready June 2018.The RBI highly critical cryptocurrencies including bitcoin past . On three occasions , central bank cautioned holders traders risks using virtual currencies . RBI issued first warning December 2013 , second February 2017 recent December 2017.India , fiat-reliant country , began tightening noose cryptocurrencies 2018 effort prevent money laundering , sponsorship terrorism tax evasion . In January 2018 , India ’ Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told Indian parliament , “ Bitcoins cryptocurrencies legal tender indulging transactions risk. ” Cryptocurrency trading firm Coinbase entered talks U.S. Securities Exchange Commission registering licensed broker-dealer firm electronic trading venue , The Wall Street Journal reported Friday , April 6 , 2018.The move comes U.S. regulators begun clarifying stance virtual currencies . Testifying Senate February 6 , 2018 , SEC chairman Jay Clayton made clear considered initial coin offering ( ICO ) tokens securities.While likely regulatory laws surrounding ICOs settled court ( perhaps even Supreme Court ) , ICO tokens legally classified securities , exchange wants list tokens needs either register national securities exchange operate exemption set alternative trading system ( ATS ) .As SEC spelled statement March 7 , 2018 , entity wants become ATS needs register SEC broker-dealer become member self-regulating organization ( SRO ) , Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ) . “ An ATS must comply federal securities laws SRO 's rules file Form ATS SEC , ” statement reads.In possible lead-up plans becoming ATS , March 26 , 2018 , San Francisco-based Coinbase announced adding support ERC20 trading platforms . ERC20 Ethereum technical standard majority ICO tokens based . “ This paves way supporting ERC20 assets across Coinbase products future , though ’ announcing support specific assets features time , ” Coinbase said blog post.Coinbase alone making moves toward becoming ATS . Recently , mobile payment app company Circle acquired Poloniex , another U.S.-based exchange , plans “ clean ” exchange . A slide initially leaked Circle presentation stated , “ Circle briefed SEC transaction indicated upon closing begin process registering new entity SEC FINRA Broker/Dealer turn licensed ATS… ” On March 7 , 2018 , Bittrex also said communication SEC , stating website “ ... look forward continuing proactive dialogue SEC regulators build secure , fully-regulated environment blockchain encourages innovation economic growth. ” South Africa joined growing list countries expect citizens pay income tax cryptocurrency earnings.The South African Revenue Service ( SARS ) released statement today , April 6 , 2018 , making clear , even though country consider cryptocurrencies legal tender , still pay taxes gains.That means anyone paid goods services bitcoin must declare would ordinary income . Also , traders make money buying cryptocurrencies low selling high pay capital gains profits . Further , anyone mines cryptocurrencies pay taxes money make well. “ The onus taxpayers declare cryptocurrency-related taxable income tax year received accrued . Failure could result interest penalties , ” SARS said.SARS still yet make clear value added tax ( VAT ) status bitcoin . `` The 2018 annual budget review indicates VAT treatment cryptocurrencies reviewed . Pending policy clarity regard , SARS require VAT registration vendor purposes supply cryptocurrencies , '' SARS said.South Africa alone taxing bitcoin . Many countries , including U.S. , Japan South Korea , tax gains arising selling , trading purchasing items cryptocurrencies , well gains accrued mining chain-splits.As reported Wall Street Journal , bitcoin use surged South Africa amid political economic instability country , used transfer money without restriction due sanctions going bank.In past , South Africa taken open-minded stance bitcoin cryptocurrencies . In 2014 , South African Reserve Bank ( SARB ) issued position paper virtual currencies declared virtual currency “ legal status regulatory framework ” , therefore , unregulated South Africa . But July 2017 , SARB began work blockchain-based solutions provider Bankymoon test number new cryptocurrency regulations country.While early buzz around Bitcoin centered new , fast , cheap permissionless method online payment , focus moved medium exchange store value past years . It ’ clear bitcoin useful censorship-resistant payments may otherwise possible without new technology , much recent hype around tracking price anything else point.Although general activity Bitcoin network continued rise , recent report blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis shows growing percentage activity related trading exchanges.There variety reasons average person street interested using bitcoin payments . For example , user interfaces still hard non-techies use , network congestion leads high fees , price volatility something people used dealing wallets ( least developed countries ) .On top , one key issue often overlooked : capital gains taxes.Who ’ Reporting Capital Gains Taxes Purchases Made via Bitcoin ? In United States many countries , capital gains taxes must paid every time individual uses bitcoin stash make purchase , long bitcoin price gone since bitcoin first acquired.For example , let ’ say someone buys 1 bitcoin price $ 1,000 . This person simply holds bitcoin couple years , eventually worth $ 10,000 . If person goes store purchases television $ 500 , ’ effectively selling portion bitcoin holdings profit . These gains supposed taxed.When imagine person earning bitcoin regular basis buying something small meal coffee every day , becomes easy see keeping track everything would quite cumbersome , especially bitcoin wallets offer pretty much zero assistance area time.Even buyer seller involved transaction bitcoin enthusiasts , ’ make much sense make deal denominated bitcoin ; tax headache worth it.Instead , makes much sense individuals places like United States simply convert $ 1,000 worth bitcoin holdings local currency way bitcoin debit card spending every then.It ’ unclear many people effectively become tax evaders accident ’ spending bitcoin gains without reporting . Obviously , involved illicit activities tend less concerned tax implications using bitcoin online payments ’ already attempting hide transactions authorities anyway.The Cryptocurrency Fairness ActSo ’ solution usability issues caused capital gains taxes ? One might change tax law , least United States.The Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act introduced Congress last year would exempt bitcoin transactions $ 600 capital gains taxation . This means bitcoin users would calculate tax implications bitcoin payments ’ amounts greater $ 600 . Notably , exemption already applies foreign currencies.The passage act would wonders usability bitcoin payments Americans.Hedging Options Could Also HelpAnother useful tool avoiding tax-related usability issues bitcoin may hedging options wallets . This already available Abra.The basic idea hold bitcoin smart contract hedged U.S. dollars currency avoid bitcoin ’ price volatility . This setup would useful anyone interested using bitcoin payments necessarily gaining exposure price swings cryptoasset.If someone hold bitcoins U.S. dollars , longer worry gains losses whenever make transaction ; however , also lose access store-of-value properties bitcoin situation.On April 5 , 2018 , blow bitcoin occurred Reserve Bank India ( RBI ) banned banks regulated financial entities dealing cryptocurrency.Despite media report 10 percent Bitcoin transactions happen India , news come surprise , considering nation clamped cryptocurrency regulation far year . Since 2013 , nation ’ financial regulators warned difficulties controlling cryptocurrencies , like stricter regulatory governments , preventing new asset classes ’ nefarious use cases : money laundering terrorist financing.The Indian regulators ’ treatment cryptocurrency even less surprise considering done past fiat currency , Indian rupee . Back 2016 , RBI announced demonetization ( stripping currency value ) ₹500 ₹1,000 banknotes Indian rupee , stating action would help crack murky shadow economy activity ( counterfeiting , terrorism , etc . ) .Based information , ’ stretch assume seemingly anonymous sovereignless computer currency seem RBI ’ monetary policy comfort zone . Taking time perform due diligence might also detracting task government wants maintain tight regulatory control also , politically crucial projects execute.India ’ Other Political ProjectsIn 2018 world economic report , International Monetary Fund stated Asia accounted half world ’ economic growth within last year ; within Asia , India recognized fastest-growing nation.Another report indicated meet accelerating growth , India invested record $ 18 billion year ( March 2017-18 ) build improve roads . These efforts part Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’ greater goals promises increase employment connectivity increased government spending infrastructure.Even RBI banning financial entities dealing cryptocurrency , continues explore blockchain technology utility employing cryptocurrency . One company worked advisor eventually contributed white paper RBI published blockchain technology MonetaGo . On website , MonetaGo describes “ simple blockchain integration legacy systems , ” “ works financial institutions central banks around world provide permissioned blockchain solutions. ” In word , MonetaGo private blockchains . Also , take credit first real ( meaning live fall-back system ) blockchain deployment solution India one worldwide.While MonetaGo CTO Brendan Taylor explicitly stated Reserve Bank India “ nothing particular deployment , ” state “ RBI publicly supportive exploring blockchain technology use cases [ MonetaGo ] examining. ” Hashing Prevent “ Shotgunning ” Bitcoin Magazine spoke Taylor find MonetaGo ’ deployed blockchain solution . Essentially , MonetaGo provides platform prevents fraud financing receivables . The Reserve Bank India provided three licenses three exchange entities : RXIL , A.TReDS M1xchange . ( Note : These licenses directly related MonetaGo platform ; operation exchanges normal business . ) Even though exchanges competes within India ’ receivable financing market , use MonetaGo prevent systemic fraud , financing receivable multiple exchanges simultaneously. “ It ’ pretty common flaw U.S. anywhere else world ’ financing asset . It ’ called ‘ shooting gap ’ ‘ shotgunning. ’ Someone tries finance asset multiple times quickly possible many financiers possible , ” said Taylor.In nutshell , platform hashes information necessary receivable identified “ digital fingerprint ” shares across platform — meaning among three exchanges — duplication flagged . For know slightly less financing assets cryptocurrencies , MonetaGo ’ value thought preventing double-spend India ’ receivable financing market.For cases information existing invoice altered appear new , MonetaGo 's network ’ block financing , still alert exchanges perform additional due diligence . MonetaGo n't participate network . Since ’ decentralized across exchanges , MonetaGo control data : It simply built maintains platform.No Tokens , No Regulators , No ProblemsAccording Taylor , ’ difficult say often type fraud happens India . Exchanges like operating year . And though use case preventing fraud financing receivables might seem minor compared ambitious blockchain applications conceptualized , Taylor admitted continue assessing financial supply chain opportunities.In simplest terms , MonetaGo ’ regulatory advantage use tokens. “ The purpose network transfer information people ensure integrity data , ” said Taylor . MonetaGo ’ role transfer information among three competitive exchanges.He laid fundamental difference MonetaGo versus blockchain enterprise solution uses token : “ A token essentially allows accounting arithmetic performed blockchain maintain value particular asset transferring ownership . We [ MonetaGo ] transferring value ownership anything . We transferring information one party another — ’ fundamental difference. ” He went explain although live deployment lined RBI banned financial entities dealing cryptocurrencies , MonetaGo working blockchain solution platform since 2015 . According Taylor , deploying tokenless blockchain solution takes significant time effort , “ It ’ mean feat get bunch competitors agree upon technology use. ” On April 10 , 2018 , 22 European countries joined forces cooperate blockchain regulation education.The European Blockchain Partnership “ vehicle cooperation amongst Member States exchange experience expertise technical regulatory fields prepare launch EU-wide blockchain applications across Digital Single Market benefit public private sectors , ” states European Commission press release.A complete list participating countries includes Austria , Belgium , Bulgaria , Czech Republic , Estonia , Finland , France , Germany , Ireland , Latvia , Lithuania , Luxembourg , Malta , Netherlands , Norway , Poland , Portugal , Slovakia , Slovenia , Spain , Sweden U.K. An invitation join partnership extended “ countries , Members EU European Economic Area. ” Spearheaded European Commission , partnership wants ensure Europe stays forefront blockchain development years come . The press release gives nod blockchain technology “ promoting user trust , ” partnership believes play foundational role number digital services future , including logistics , finance regulatory reporting.Partner states especially see potential blockchain technology integrate Europe ’ Digital Single Market , policy initiative looks unite Europe ’ disparate online markets one . Like Digital Single Market , partnership try avoid disjointed approaches blockchain development among EU European Economic Area members . It ’ partnership ’ hope cooperation lead smooth , cross-country interoperability blockchain technology “ full compliance EU laws clear governance models help services using blockchain [ technology ] flourish across Europe. ” The European Commissioner Digital Economy Society , Mariya Gabriel , sees partnership progressive move affect quality Europe ’ public technological services better. “ In future , public services use blockchain technology . Blockchain great opportunity Europe Member States rethink information systems , promote user trust protection personal data , help create new business opportunities establish new areas leadership , benefiting citizens , public services companies . The Partnership launched today enables Member States work together European Commission turn enormous potential blockchain technology better services citizens. ” A second major Hong Kong–based cryptocurrency exchange planning setting shop Malta , small island nation Mediterranean . OKEx , one top five cryptocurrency exchanges 24-hour trading volume , announced today , April 12 , 2018 , expanding operations Malta . In late March , Binance , largest exchange trading volume , also announced plans move operations cryptocurrency-friendly EU member state.In email Bitcoin Magazine , spokesperson OKEx clarified , “ ... everything stays Hong Kong ( functions ) establishing new entity Malta full accordance expected Malta regulations framework . This expansion effect existing offices operations jurisdictions. ” OKEx CEO Chris Lee stated : “ We look forward working Malta government forward thinking shares many values : important protection traders general public , compliance Anti Money Laundering Know Your Customer standards , recognition innovation importance continued development Blockchain ecosystem. ” OKEx says already met Maltese government regulatory leaders get better understanding country ’ evolving regulatory plans provide feedback.The move establishes Malta growing hub cryptocurrency space . Currently , country process setting Malta Digital Innovation Authority aimed building regulatory framework blockchain technology , extension cryptocurrency , country.OKEx Binance Hong Kong–based exchanges looking expand outside Hong Kong . In recent weeks , Bitfinex , another major cryptocurrency exchange , announced moving Switzerland . Of countries , China heavy handed toward cryptocurrencies . Starting September 2017 , People ’ Bank China completely banned initial coin offerings . Later , country froze bank accounts associated exchanges began clamping bitcoin miners . In February 2018 , began taking measures cut one remaining avenues citizens buy cryptocurrencies . Governed principal “ one country , two systems , ” Hong Kong China China . The city reverted back Chinese rule 1997 agreement Hong Kong would remain autonomous China would evaluate revise relationship moving forward . Since , China slowly encroaching Hong Kong ’ sovereignty . Thus , businesses choose operate Hong Kong could risk complications future models banned China , though still legitimate ( ) Hong Kong.Cryptocurrency investors appear skirting taxes . Whether keeping crypto ’ anti-establishment roots lack ability , American cryptocurrency practitioners testing IRS ’ tolerance crypto tax evasion.Tax day United States tomorrow , April 17 , 2018 , according popular tax filing service Credit Karma , cryptocurrency holders reported earnings losses 2017 tax documents . Out company ’ 250,000 new filings , 100 disclosed capital gains cryptocurrency investments , figures line company ’ former reports cryptocurrency tax documentation.Certainly , Credit Karma ’ user base constitute whole America ’ crypto investor populace . But could reflect demographic ’ general resistance paying taxes investments , could something IRS ’ policy.In 2014 , IRS released official notice regarding cryptocurrency tax policy . First foremost , IRS treats virtual currencies property , subjecting capital gains taxes affect traditional investments like stocks , bonds real estate . These taxes applicable anyone received payment goods and/or services crypto ( part salary , instance ) , well miners , must account gains part income.The tax code appears straightforward enough , uncertainty remains . Given IRS treats trade taxable event onus reporting rests investor , reporting cryptocurrency investments seem confusing convoluted untrained accounting finance. “ Even tax deadline rapidly approaching U.S. , ’ still seeing lots people unsure proper way prepare cryptocurrency taxes . Properly accounting crypto-to-crypto trades , trading multiple exchanges , purchases made cryptocurrency overwhelming task , ” Chris Kovalik , founder Cointaxes , told Bitcoin Magazine.Kovalik finds IRS ’ policy places “ burden … taxpayer follow account government ’ guidance filing taxes. ” Unlike tax codes offer standards historical precedent , crypto investors touchstone guidance.According Los Angeles Times , IRS suggested taxpayers review “ factual scenarios closely resemble circumstances ” seek guidance , something David Klasing , tax accountant lawyer , told Times amounts “ basically telling practitioners take wild-ass guess. ” And guess could look answer questions stem variety scenarios . Along crypto-to-crypto trades , “ [ many ] people may simply know IRS stated spending crypto taxable event , akin barter transaction , ” Jon Brose , attorney Seward & Kissel ’ Blockchain Cryptocurrency Group , told Bitcoin Magazine . This means day-to-day purchases bitcoin currencies subject capital gains taxes.As market matures , gray areas still . For example , advent airdrops hard forks cryptocurrency dispersal means investors likely wrestle reporting earnings income , well.As look barrel America ’ first cryptocurrency tax season , early adopters veteran enthusiasts likely bear taxman ’ heaviest brunt , likely years previously unreported gains follow . Depending size stash , individuals could 13,000 users Coinbase legally obligated report IRS back February.These account records likely belong realized great profits original investments , run-of-the-mill investor . Brose believes average investor probably ’ think report gains since “ practical problem tracking cryptos spent sold ” becomes much hassle reporting modest portfolio . He also finds “ individuals spending crypto frequently relatively small items may think ’ make lot sense declare taxable event every time buy cup coffee. ” Given formal guidance nebulous IRS ’ ability enforce policy yet seen , cryptocurrency investors may inclined take calculated risks become commonplace volatile market . But IRS wants investors work future , things change , Brose argues . “ To ensure greater compliance , IRS ought make rules cryptocurrencies conform way crypto actually works used , taxpayers accurately compute tax liabilities arising crypto transactions. ” Until time , investors must either navigate filing , seek help accountant taxation service , hope portfolios fly IRS ’ radar.Telegram CEO Pavel Durov battling Russian security forces , implemented block Monday , April 16 , 2018 , messaging app refused court order “ grant state security services access users ’ encrypted messages , ” according Reuters.The move initiated Alexander Zharov , head Russian watchdog organization Roskomnadzor , blocked 18 sub-networks various IP addresses belonging Amazon Google process. “ We currently informed companies significant number IP addresses located clouds two services fallen block due court ruling , ” Zharov commented . He stated Telegram potentially used terrorists “ coordinate attacks ” Russia neighbors.But skies darken defense seems like lost cause , Durov refusing give , Telegram customers received following notification early morning : “ For last 24 hours Telegram ban internet providers Russia . The reason refusal provide encryption keys Russian security agencies . For us , easy decision . We promised users 100 % privacy would rather cease exist violate promise. ” Durov since taken account VK — Russian social network — explain offering bitcoin grants companies individuals alike run proxy servers virtual private networks ( VPNs ) . He says ’ “ happy donate millions dollars ” personal stash illustrate assist cause , noting VPNs proxy servers work hindrances set place Russian authorities.Proxy servers operate acting connective tissue clients servers . Normally , clients seek information resources outside servers thus link proxy server , decides best way simplify control complexity incoming data . In addition , proxy servers offer anonymity users , utilized bypass blocks certain IP addresses.A VPN extends private network across public one allows users send receive information without disclosing identities . According Durov , systems require third-party funding , ’ urging players money get game alongside him.As last 24 hours shown , ongoing war progress , Russia ’ supervisory authorities willing block millions IP addresses cloud hosting without regard losses extraneous projects.While Russia accounts 7 percent Telegram ’ users , Durov called recent ban “ unconstitutional ” commented threats privacy principles important numbers. “ Even lose entire [ Russian market ] , Telegram ’ organic growth regions compensate loss within couple months , ” Durov mentioned . “ However , important personally make sure everything Russian users. ” Several venture capitalists ( VCs ) entrepreneurs petitioning federal authorities see certain virtual currencies “ different light. ” Right , many cryptocurrencies danger classified “ securities , ” would place strict regulatory scrutiny . Working change , venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz Union Square Ventures gathered team lawyers investors known “ Venture Capital Working Group ” meet U.S. Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) develop call “ safe harbor ” specific digital currencies establish long-term proposals viewed handled.The New York Times alleges several regulators considering placing well-known cryptocurrencies — including ether , world ’ second-largest digital asset — securities category , may cause prices fall drastically.Richard Levin , lawyer ’ worked various blockchain cryptocurrency ventures , described meeting “ crucial ” safety digital assets respective users. “ It ’ ‘ come lord ’ moment , ” explained . “ We seeing watershed moment many firms digital asset community may ignorant law — poorly informed — coming terms fact subject regulators. ” While details surrounding meeting remain largely confidential , group says ’ trying garner “ utility token ” classifications many specific cryptocurrencies.Many virtual entities introduced initial coin offerings ( ICOs ) . The process involves team entrepreneurs selling virtual assets raise funds future projects . Generally , currencies work “ internal payment methods ” software entrepreneurs create.For coin classify security , users buy must opportunity transform money capital garner profit owning asset without taking physical possession it.Securities typically designed “ shares ” stakes company , utility tokens represent “ access [ ] company ’ product service. ” In bearing practical uses , utility tokens usually exempt securities regulations.Since 2017 , $ 6 billion revenue generated initial coin offerings , trade via unregulated exchange platforms . Many investors claim coins , serving payment methods , carry utilities , classified securities investment contracts.But Jay Clayton — chairman SEC — disagrees , believes every token offered ICO officially “ registered security. ” Very , SEC sent dozens subpoenas individuals ventures involved cryptocurrency , requesting data regarding certain digital assets marketed issued.Investments fall securities category must paperwork filed registered exchanges . For part , entities like bitcoin , litecoin monero ’ placed , originally distributed ICOs . Furthermore , new coins given daily computers work extract maintain current networks.While ether follows similar pattern , coin still danger , primarily due Ethereum ’ past garnering funds ether token “ presales ” — events classified ICOs . The Venture Capital Working Group arguing ether “ become decentralized , ” labeled security , ever achieve “ full decentralization , ” must exempt future securities laws.The group says support many “ key players ” digital currency blockchain arena . Nevertheless , regulators slow accept proposal , press time , unclear results arise . Bitcoin Magazine provide updates story occur.When Arthur Breitman , cofounder Tezos , published white paper cryptocurrency project September 2014 , listed author L.M . Goodman . Later , Breitman disclosed real author behind work , many wondered used pseudonym.As turned , time began working Tezos , project went raise $ 232 million initial coin offering ( ICO ) July 2017 , Breitman working investment bank Morgan Stanley . He also registered broker-dealer Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ) , self-regulatory body oversight dealers brokers U.S.FINRA requires registered securities professionals let employers know for-profit business conducting sidelines . Breitman , left Morgan Stanley 2016 longer registered FINRA , neglected inform employer Tezos , fact used pseudonym white paper indicates may trying conceal involvement.These details Tezos project brought light October 2017 , Reuters published full report project , thereby putting Tezos radar regulatory bodies , FINRA U.S. Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) .Now , according April 19 , 2018 , report Reuters , part April 18 , 2018 , settlement , FINRA fined Breitmen $ 20,000 suspended associating broker-dealers two years allegations made false statements Tezos project time Morgan Stanley.The question , big deal punishments , impact going forward Tezos project , yet launch ? Relatively Small FineFINRA SEC fines uncommon . Anyone checks broker records institutions like RBC , Vanguard Bank America , people U.S. Canada place money , see financial firms dings , , Breitman , individuals settle either confirming denying charges.A look FINRA ’ monthly rundown disciplinary actions makes clear Breitman ’ fine $ 20,000 low end . Many fines range hundreds thousands , millions , dollars . In comparison , fine appears nothing minor slap wrist.More notable fact Breitman barred securities industry two years . Few people barred securities industry length time , two years upper limit , according FINRA ’ sanction guidelines , state “ absent extraordinary circumstances , misconduct serious merit suspension two years probably warrant bar ( individual ) expulsion ( member firm ) securities industry. ” Potential RoadblocksAs spelled Securities Exchange Act 1934 , broker-dealer person company business buying selling securities , account behalf customers . The ban essentially means next two years , Breitman associate company business buying selling securities , unless gets special waiver . Even special waiver , still would able associate directly business aspects ( deals , committee meetings , financial activities , etc . ) securities-related company.If Tezos tokens , known “ tezzies , ” deemed securities , may pose problem Tezos road . Earlier year , SEC Chairman Jay Clayton stated ICO tokens securities . If SEC issues ruling effect , ICO projects would register SEC . ( Note venture capitalists currently lobbying exemptions would allow tokens categorized “ utility tokens ” rather securities . ) The upshot , suspended industry , eventually Breitman may distance Tezos project . Robert Hockett , Edward Cornell Professor Law Cornell Law School , told Bitcoin Magazine SEC deems Tezos securities business , project “ allowed associated [ Breitman ] way. ” Of note , Tezos actually consists two entities : Tezos Foundation , Zug-based nonprofit oversaw Tezos ICO ; Dynamic Ledger Solutions ( DLS ) , Delaware-based company control Breitman wife , Kathleen Breitman , owns oversees development Tezos software . Although two entities separate , also connected ; instance , Breitmans went Tezos Foundation last year get then-president deposed . DLS directly associated ICO , DLS shown profiting buying selling securities , Breitman may restricted actively participating business. “ The securities laws SEC define ‘ affiliation ’ broadly purposes , ” said Hockett . In statement Reuters , Sarah Lightdale , attorney Breitman , played settlement . “ The settlement FINRA unrelated impact launch Tezos network , ” said . Then added , “ Arthur cooperated fully FINRA times Arthur pleased put personal matter behind him. ” WikiLeaks find alternative solutions online shop .

Oops.The Distributed Markets conference took place Chicago April 23 , 2018 , featured array blockchain financial experts working shed light opportunities changes happening cryptocurrency space.Among main goals conference educate attendees could integrate blockchain technology businesses , thereby increasing cost-effectiveness overall efficiency . A Blockchain Academy workshop hackathon also available give developers entrepreneurs chance study blockchain macro cases showcase skills.In panel moderated Joseph Bradley , entitled “ Crypto Regulation : Striking Balance Between Compliance Growth , ” speakers Colleen Sullivan CMT Digital ; Illinois state regulator Sean T. O ’ Kelly ; Haimera Workie , senior director FINRA ’ Office Emerging Regulatory Issues ; Tennessee blockchain lawyer J . Gray Sasser Frost Brown Todd addressed topic regulation.Perhaps biggest issues hitting crypto arena regulation , tokens virtual assets classified . The Commodities Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) , example , jurisdiction commodities like bitcoin lists bitcoin futures regulated interest exchanges.The Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) , however , works regulate securities derivatives securities , seeking label tokens distributed Initial Coin Offerings ( ICOs ) , could subject strict regulatory tactics could seriously decrease values . The SEC since issued several subpoenas virtual asset enterprises better understand certain tokens issued marketed.Sullivan quick tackle issue . “ All securities traded registered securities exchanges United States , ” told audience.She explained SEC first weighed cryptocurrencies July 2017 , released investigative report DAO , stating certain tokens fell “ securities ” category per specific regulations . Presently , 1,500 separate virtual tokens , none traded securities exchanges way , suggested SEC standards.Sasser also offered insight , suggesting token pre-sold offered ICO , technically qualify security unless meets certain level functionality.One primary arguments among stand tokens classifying securities used payment methods investing new coins , , therefore , qualify “ utility tokens ” due practical nature . Thus far , SEC hesitant accept viewpoint.Sasser said issue industry clouded uncertainty. “ I ’ panels long time , usually , first answer lot kinds questions ‘ I ’ know , ’ ” joked.For part , Sasser believes SEC clear stating tokens fall , though ’ failed guide distributors along way.Sullivan mentioned states follow separate rules comes governing cryptocurrency activity . Illinois , example , long refused recognize cryptocurrencies valid means money transmission , , according fellow speaker O ’ Kelly , state regulators beginning reverse overall views attempting attract blockchain startups build Illinois possible tech hub.Discussing “ regulatory gaps ” crypto arena , Sullivan explained CFTC Commissioner Brian B. Quintenz calling industry “ self-regulate , ” Congress yet taken reins . She said Quintenz asking blockchain cryptocurrency leaders impose self-regulatory organization enforce strict standards industry members follow.Sullivan mentioned steps toward association already begun , recent example coming Tyler Cameron Winklevoss New York ’ Gemini Exchange . They proposed Virtual Commodities Association , industry-sponsored , self-regulatory organization U.S. virtual currency industry , set forth practical standards regarding exchange officiated , among goals.Sullivan believes Congress eventually get involved , suggested maneuvers like could cover main ground then.In meantime , blockchain presenting several new opportunities recording data . O ’ Kelly , says government always indirectly involved verification process blockchain transactions , says state representatives recently approached organization wanted track entire life car blockchain , including change owners along way . That change title would entail government-based authorization.Sullivan concluded discussion explaining , crypto market lacks solid regulation , influx institutional capital entering space eventually lead prime broker ’ presence , thus paving way stability efficiency. “ I think regulatory environment becomes clear next 12 months , ’ going see lot capital , ” explained . “ Right , changes industry applied retail. ” The U.S. Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) relatively stringent views security utility tokens . The organization seeking label virtual tokens originally distributed initial coin offerings ( ICOs ) securities , would subject strict regulatory practices potentially massive repercussions prices.One tokens ether , originally distributed marketed presales . Members Venture Capital Working Group — organization comprised lawyers , investors cryptocurrency experts working block SEC ’ decision — argue ether become decentralized , longer looked security , thus exempt securities-related laws . Ether world ’ second-largest cryptocurrency market cap bitcoin.April 26 , 2018 , marked important step fight “ token rights. ” A congressional hearing testimony SEC ’ Division Corporation Finance ( organization directly responsible establishing token policies ) took place potentially develop reasonable approaches toward token sales classifications.Minnesota Representative Tom Emmer led discussion SEC division head William Hinman . Throughout hearing , Emmer voiced support cryptocurrency entrepreneurship innovation , stating , “ People tend fear ’ know . If people sailing oceans time Columbus believed world flat , ’ great discoveries New World. ” The discussion marks new attitude amongst SEC members . Chairman Jay Clayton reported past wants see tokens registered ICOs classified securities future , Hinman assured listeners representatives trying view situation openly see entities might exhibit utility-based behaviors.During hearing , Rep. Emmer asked Hinman , “ Is possible utility token would security ’ done capital formation ? ” Hinman replied ultimately possible , tokens “ hallmarks ” security . Additionally , stated many fundraisers intended “ develop networks ” token strictly intended use buying mechanism goods services. “ We certainly imagine token holder buying token utility , investment , ” Hinman continued . “ Especially ’ decentralized network ’ used , central actors would information asymmetries would know token investors. ” In recent panel discussion Distributed : Markets Conference Chicago , Tennessee blockchain lawyer Gray Sasser Frost Brown Todd explained SEC relatively straightforward saying tokens fall , done good job guiding distributors token builders.This recurring point concern . Emmer echoed sentiment , asking regulation U.S. better clarified U.S. investors . He queried whether possible assist crypto-related business developers better understand contributions tokens may securities , thus avoiding SEC enforcements.Hinman — likely referring Venture Capital Working Group — replied one steps SEC taking “ meeting participants ideas token ’ regulated security ” working structured . Hinman pointed SEC heavily engaged academics , industry departments better explore everything might work , long run , U.S. “ pragmatic ” support new technology.Unfortunately , hearing also shed light lack education among American leaders concerning cryptocurrencies . Some comments questions arose , example , referenced bitcoin security despite asset already established commodity Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) .Figures like Aaron Wright — director blockchain project Cardozo — took Twitter express thoughts concerns . Wright says hearing amongst significant fulsome commentaries delivered SEC regarding token regulation , also “ superficial appeal ” treating bitcoin related tokens securities , many still seen “ speculative assets. ” “ I hope ’ [ go ] path , ” wrote . “ These types arguments could conceivably gain legs , given heavy emphasis tokens way mutate . Certain tokens could start commodity mutate securities networks consolidate begin exhibit less utility . There ’ logical boundaries types arguments become dangerous likely unforeseen consequences. ” On hand , nonprofit research advocacy association Coin Center positive hearing , commenting SEC ’ views generally “ right approach ” came examining tokens ’ usefulness decentralization decide whether tokens securities utilities. “ It ’ awesome hear SEC ’ S Director Corporation Finance testify looking issues similar perspective , ” said Peter Van Valkenburgh , organization ’ director research , Coin Center blog.Vancouver-based blockchain cryptocurrency firm DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc. announced official launch BitScore web API . The platform designed provide cryptocurrency deposit withdrawal risk-scoring anti-money laundering ( AML ) anti-fraud compliance.DMG Blockchain Solutions seeks manage , operate develop end-to-end solutions monetizing blockchain ecosystem , BitScore already used crypto exchanges enterprise payment platforms assess risks legal non-compliance . BitScore engineered DMG ’ Blockseer development team powered sophisticated artificial intelligence machine learning models examine flow cryptocurrency funds blockchain establish respective origins.Speaking Bitcoin Magazine , DMG CTO Danny Yang explained , “ Understanding provenance source destination addresses imperative exchange payment platform sensitive regulatory compliance . Allowing address accepts deposits , makes payments deposits disreputable networks potentially abetting activities , creates legal liabilities banks , exchanges traders. ” Here ’ works . Customers submit cryptocurrency source destination address BitScore . The platform ’ algorithm returns risk score user evaluating source funds . Customers also informed time past monitored address ever sent funds high-risk parties . These typically include dark markets , hacking sites money-laundering services.BitScore also examines several generations transactions directions ( receiving sending ) applies weighting function determines amount questionable cryptocurrency flowing studied transactions . At press time , BitScore supports bitcoin , though plans add ether ERC20 tokens coming summer . Litecoin bitcoin cash added end 2018.BitScore first effort kind . As regulatory compliance cryptocurrency platforms becomes crucial , several ventures involved blockchain arena working implement changes operations certify rules followed , customer safety intact monetary authorities remain satisfied.One company — cryptocurrency exchange platform Vaultbank — recently entered partnership Gordian Compliance Solutions guarantee AML Know-Your-Customer ( KYC ) compliance.COO Aaron Travis stated , “ If ’ exchange , buying digital assets originator person selling gone great efforts get know , [ ] undergone KYC AML checks , I would wary . If platform ’ buying digital currency going hoops — standard , basic efforts protect investor — need wary that. ” Other companies — like Coinfirm , risk compliance platform designed predominantly cryptocurrency businesses — also released APIs built customer security AML protection.Some countries Asia feeling pain inadequate cryptocurrency regulation , others , like India , China South Korea , taken uncertain hostile stance cryptocurrency . In contrast , Japan building clear framework virtual currency exchanges , soon initial coin offerings ( ICOs ) , operate . In , Japan becoming hotspot virtual currency exchanges afford comply strict rules , also creating regulatory template rest Asia follow . Japan always friendly cryptocurrency , took early hit 2014 Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange Mt . Gox became target largest bitcoin hack ever . The exchange handling 70 percent bitcoin transactions world , series messy complications , abruptly stopped trading February 2014 . Following , 650,000 bitcoin worth $ 390 million time ( $ 6 billion today ’ value ) reported missing.In response massive virtual currency heist , Financial Action Task Force ( FATF ) , Paris-based international body creates policies combat money laundering , issued “ Guidance Risk-Based Approach Cryptocurrencies ” 2015 . The 46-page report recommends countries license virtual currency exchanges subject rules oversight financial institution money transmitting business.New Laws , Big ChangesPrompted desire protect consumers FATF ’ recommendations , Japan revised Payment Services Act . The new law , went effect April 2017 , two things . First , legally defines virtual currency form payment . ( Japan still define bitcoin legal tender , acknowledges use purchase things . ) Second , law requires virtual currency exchange wants business Japan solicit citizens register country ’ Financial Services Agency ( FSA ) . Because existing exchanges needed time bring operations date new standards , FSA gave exchanges operation law went effect six-month grace period apply license . Any exchange applied license within period allowed continue operating indeterminate period time application still pending . These exchanges fall special category “ quasi-operators , ” meaning fully licensed operators , somewhere between.Under new law , virtual currency exchanges Japan required accountable customers . They keep customer assets separate assets exchange , maintain proper bookkeeping , undergo annual audits , file business reports comply strict know-your-customer anti-money-laundering rules , more.First Licensed ExchangesRegistering exchange Japan long , involved process take six months . The FSA licensed first 11 exchanges September 2017 . In early December 2017 , licensed another four , end December 2017 , licensed 16th exchange . At time , 16 quasi-operators still applications pending process upgrading internal operations . Then , late January 2018 , disaster struck . Coincheck , one quasi-operators , hacked , resulting loss $ 530 million worth NEM tokens.The Coincheck theft prompted heavier oversight . The FSA began conducting on-the-spot inspections quasi-operators look security gaps , March 2018 , FSA sent punishment notices seven exchanges , even requiring two halt operations 30 days.According Asia News Network , FSA grappling handle quasi-operators . Shutting unqualified operators quickly could cause customer backlash , , time , FSA needs make sure proper security checks place.Japan ’ plan pass part work overseeing virtual currency exchanges self-regulating body ( SRO ) functions similarly Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ) works U.S.To end , April 2018 , Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Industry Association launched . The new group , comprised first 16 licensed Japanese virtual currency exchanges , power create enforce rules set fines , eventually develop standards ICOs.Legalizing ICOsAfter tackling virtual currency exchanges , Japan moving ICO market . The process began October 2017 FSA issued statement warning investors volatility ICO tokens risk fraud . In statement , FSA also clarified , depending ICO structured ( whether token characteristics virtual currency investment ) , may fall within scope Payment Services Act Financial Instruments Exchange Act.In April 2018 , Center Rule-Making Strategies Tama University released list guidelines regulating ICOs . The government-backed report states ICO projects clearly spell plan distribute funds . It also outlines rules tracking progress project , confirming identity buyers restricting insider trading . According Bloomberg , proposal deliberated Japan ’ FSA could become law years.Japan still fine-tuning oversight virtual currency exchanges , ICO framework may take years develop . But , putting clarity around industry long operated little oversight , Japan setting stage future cryptocurrencies play larger role society.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) — United States ’ top-ranking derivatives regulator — published advisory providing guidance clearinghouses exchanges seeking list cryptocurrencies platforms . The cryptocurrency space riddled concerns vetting process contracts , like bitcoin futures , CFTC looking clear air.Staff members issued following statement : “ Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( “ CFTC ” “ Commission ” ) staff believes important encourage innovation growth products , within appropriate oversight framework enables exchanges clearinghouses operate within confines core principles . To end , Commission staff continues monitor developments products discuss risks challenges present industry market participants. ” The CFTC says ’ focusing latest “ best practices ” launching cryptocurrency derivative contracts , saying exchanges able monitor “ underlying cryptocurrency spot markets ” coordinate federal regulators . They also allowed contact market participants request comments regarding pending contract launches.Division Clearing Risk Director Brian Bussey mentioned , “ CFTC staff providing information , part , aid market participants efforts design risk management programs address new risks imposed virtual currency products . In addition , guidance designed help ensure market participants follow appropriate governance processes respect launch products. ” While advisory considered final “ compliance checklist , ” offer insight pertaining current CFTC expectations aims assist clearinghouses exchanges keeping changes crypto market . The guidance provided report includes enhanced market surveillance , large trader reporting , outreach stakeholders derivatives clearing organization ( DCO ) risk management.Both CME Group Cboe Global Markets among first trading platforms launch bitcoin futures contracts December 2017 . At time , companies consulted CFTC strictly limited basis . Bitcoin ’ volatile nature price swings caused many Wall Street players — including Futures Industry Association — request CFTC examine virtual currency derivatives allowing traded.Thus far , bitcoin futures behaved new contracts , liquidity continues grow limited means . However , study conducted Federal Reserve Bank San Francisco ultimately discovered release bitcoin futures led steep drop cryptocurrency prices last January allowing “ pessimists ” enter game.The CFTC control bitcoin activity since 2015 Commodity Exchange Act . The organization worked extensively rid cryptocurrency space unregistered futures exchanges protect consumers fraud , manipulation illicit practices.This year , ’ witnessing convergence , perhaps collision , two powerful new forces data privacy : European Union General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) emergence blockchain-based privacy solutions . As blockchain technology firms continue build new solutions , five key takeaways keep mind GDPR.Personal DataThe GDPR applies “ personal data , ” defined “ information relating identified identifiable natural person ( ‘ data subject ’ ) . ” A “ data subject ” “ natural person … identified … reference identifier … specific … cultural social identity natural person. ” Moreover , personal data explicitly includes “ online identifier [ ] , ” including IP addresses.Takeaway # 1 : Essentially , almost piece data assist learning something someone likely considered personal data.Under GDPR , personal data even includes data undergone “ pseudonymization , ” meaning data processed “ longer attributed specific data subject without use additional information. ” Encryption considered highly effective means pseudonymization , “ public keys ” blockchain associated off-chain personal data also likely considered “ pseudonymized. ” While GDPR prefers encrypting data achieve pseudonymization , encryption alone remove underlying data definition personal data , therefore , serve avoid GDPR requirements.Takeaway # 2 : If personal data stored off-chain easily connected public key used blockchain solution , public key likely considered data achieved state pseudonymization still regulated personal data subject GDPR.Where personal data pseudonymized additional information needed attribute data natural person “ available , ” GDPR indicates data may considered “ anonymous information ” “ rendered anonymous. ” Because GDPR regulates personal data , anything considered anonymous thus exempt GDPR , “ … concern processing anonymous information …. ” This provision suggests path conform blockchain solutions GDPR : If blockchain architecture designed public keys fit within definition anonymous information — ensuring off-chain personal data securely encrypted , decryption available permit re-association public key — processing public keys may exempt GDPR ’ requirements , including right erasure.Takeaway # 3 : Preserving ability public keys deemed anonymous GDPR arguably critical issue concern company leveraging blockchain technology dealing personal data.Controller vs. ProcessorEntities subject GDPR different obligations based whether deemed “ Controller ” “ Processor ” personal data . In general , Controller “ determines purposes means processing personal data , ” Processor “ processes personal data behalf controller. ” The determination whether entity acts Controller Processor activity-specific , entity-specific . This means , different contexts , entity may deemed Controller , Processor , Controller Processor . Controllers , entities determining means purposes processing , significantly obligations GDPR Processors . Most importantly , Controllers responsibility implementing requests individuals want personal data deleted , amended transferred.Takeaway # 4 : Companies leveraging blockchain technology design systems avoid determining data processed , thus avoid deemed data Controller.The Rights Data Subjects Lawful Basis Processing DataThe GDPR gives data subjects various rights respect Controllers data . Chief among rights data portability ( i.e. , right take data ) , rectification ( i.e. , right amend incorrect data ) erasure ( i.e. , right forgotten ) . In general , rights exercised request data subject , although exceptions rights certain cases , data processed retained pursuant legal obligation.The obligations data Controllers facilitate data subjects ’ rights vary based lawful basis data processed . The processing EU personal data must supported one six legal bases , according purpose processing . These bases : Consent . Consent data subject one specific purposes.Contract . Necessary performance contract.Legal Obligation . Necessary compliance legal obligation data Controller subject.Public Interest . Necessary performance task carried public interest.Vital Interests . Necessary protection vital interests data subject.Legitimate Interests . Necessary legitimate interests Controller third party , unless overridden fundamental rights freedoms data subject.Because consent may withdrawn time , requiring deletion personal data collected basis consent , advisable reliable basis processing personal data entered onto blockchain . Similarly , personal data may collected processed pursuant performance contract , contract terminated expires , lawful basis processing ends data must deleted . On hand , data collected comply legal obligation likely exempt right erasure.Takeaway # 5 : Understanding applicable lawful basis bases processing data — especially applicable limitations exceptions data subject rights basis — designing system accordingly critical building GDPR-compliant blockchain solutions.Avoiding CollisionUltimately , whether two forces collision course yet determined . Avoiding collision require favorable interpretations EU regulators ensure GDPR deprive EU EU data subjects benefits offered blockchain technology.A decision EU officials public keys used appropriately designed blockchain solutions constitute personal data would go long way toward reconciling blockchain technology GDPR.Even determination made , users blockchain solutions monitor whether technological developments , specifically data storage encryption , would affect change determination . At critical moment , imperative blockchain firms understand GDPR ’ framework take proactive stance , developing technologies legal positions carefully account GDPR ’ requirements.As two powerful forces continue emerge take effect , EU regulators blockchain technologists alike would well remember GDPR blockchain-based solutions share many fundamental goals , right individuals control data minimization data sharing . To demonstrate compatibility blockchains GDPR , principles leveraged greatest extent possible blockchain solution architectures.The Final Word : With right technical architecture legal analysis , companies harness benefits blockchain ensuring data stored blockchain compliant GDPR requirements.South Korea ’ Supreme Court ruled bitcoin legally recognizable asset . The landmark ruling occurred May 30 , 2018 , overturns decision made one country ’ lower courts case dating back last year.In September 2017 , Suwon District Court charged 33-year-old Ahn sale distribution child pornography . Operating website since 2013 , Ahn arrested May 2017 disseminating 235,000 obscene files . Even though court handed Ahn guilty verdict 18 months prison actions , confiscate 216 bitcoins Ahn accumulated exchange porn.According court , government could seize Ahn ’ bitcoins , unlike assets tied illicit dealings , ’ tangible. “ It appropriate confiscate bitcoins form electronic files without physical entities , unlike cash , ” court ruled . “ Virtual currency assume objective standard value. ” Now , country ’ Supreme Court thinks otherwise . The Suwon District Court ’ decision appealed , , upon challenged South Korea ’ highest court , ’ hold up.Seeing Ahn accrued digital fortune exchange illegal service , court reversed decision mandated lawful government confiscate it. “ Korean law stipulates seizable hidden asset ranges cash , deposits , stocks , forms tangible intangible objects holding standard value , ” ruling Tuesday reads . “ Bitcoin intangible comes form digitized files , traded exchange used buy goods . Therefore , receiving bitcoins act taking profits. ” Ahn ’ sentence remain , ’ forfeit 191 bitcoins , worth roughly $ 1.4 million press time along $ 654,000 cash . Tracking Ahn ’ transactions Bitcoin ’ ledger , court able determine many bitcoins received payment. “ [ Ahn ] received bitcoins giving certain bitcoin address pornography watchers online . Records stored Bitcoin blockchain proved bitcoins sent seen profits online , ” court ruling states.The ruling decisive , roundabout , benchmark cryptocurrency ’ legal status country . It gives digital assets like bitcoin enhanced legitimacy time South Korea also process legalizing regulating Initial Coin Offerings ( ICOs ) . After effecting domestic ban ICOs September last year , South Korean government approached cryptocurrency industry ambivalent resolve . Tuesday ’ ruling outlook formal framework token sales , however , seem steering official policy clearer , proactive direction.U.S . Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) chairman Jay Clayton states SEC bending rules anytime soon comes cryptocurrencies bitcoin remains commodity , initial coin offering ( ICO ) tokens — coins offered fundraising process — classify securities. “ We going violence traditional definition security worked long time , ” explained CNBC . “ There ’ need change definition . A token , digital asset , I give money go make venture , return giving money I say ‘ get return ’ [ ; ] security regulate . We regulate offering security regulate trading security. ” The fight ongoing since April year , Venture Capital Working Group — association lawyers , traders crypto enthusiasts alike — gathered meet SEC assist regulators viewing virtual currencies “ utility tokens ” rather securities.Utility tokens often garner practical uses securities allow customers direct access company ’ products services . While utilities generally exempt SEC rules , securities , hand , often represent stakes company ’ offerings . Users garner capital profit investing securities , makes subject strict regulatory scrutiny.One biggest questions crypto-investors whether ether — world ’ second-largest cryptocurrency — would fall category . In earliest days , ether originally offered presale ( ICO ) token , since become highly decentralized , could potentially bar “ security status. ” Clayton says contrary popular belief , SEC willing assist ICOs enter plane legitimacy , granted organizers willing comply organization ’ rules. “ If ICO stock , want sell private placement , follow private placement rules , ” explained . “ If want IPO token , come see us. ” Nigel Greene — CEO founder investment firm deVere Group — says Clayton ’ stance ICOs cryptocurrencies positive sign digital assets becoming mainstream. “ The SEC right insist digital coins , bitcoin , replacement sovereign currencies , dollar , sterling , yen euro , securities , ” said . “ I believe SEC also right tokens — [ Clayton ] name — act digital assets securities . This clarification SEC removes uncertainty swirling around crypto sector serves strengthen overall proposition many major cryptocurrencies . The SEC ’ invaluable far-sighted work area highlights many governments , central banks regulators around world recognizing scale potential bitcoin cryptocurrencies. ” Switzerland ’ mortgage bank Hypothekarbank Lenzburg ( Hypi ) announced open business accounts crypto companies.While cryptocurrency blockchain technology widely accepted Switzerland , banks friendly .

The recordings online YouTube.Canada ’ government released draft regulations “ virtual currencies ” consultation period 90 days , saying proposed regulatory changes could mean loss $ 60 million 10 years businesses deal cryptocurrencies improve Canada ’ international reputation make easier crypto businesses deal overseas.The Canadian crypto business community still assessing new proposed regulations number experts told Bitcoin Magazine impact community “ massive ” “ significant ” may result shake-up consolidation companies , including blockchain companies currently space.Amber D. Scott , CEO Outlier Solutions , company focuses helping bitcoin blockchain crypto startups understand comply government regulations , said : “ If definitions broadly interpreted , could significant dislocation cryptocurrencies blockchain communities expecting regulated way . This includes blockchain company issued , sold traded token fits within definition ‘ virtual currency. ’ ” Among proposals , new regulations require firms ( including exchanges ) keep detailed records users inform government suspicious activities , provide written policies procedures , undergo risk assessment ready audits.Jason Beitchman , commercial litigation lawyer Toronto experience anti-money laundering cryptocurrency litigation , told Bitcoin Magazine : “ The impact cryptocurrency business going massive . I see playing significant role allowing market participants rise top separate others ’ get ahead compliance issues. ” Beitchman notes language draft regulations seems strangely vague unclear : “ I found language second part definition ‘ virtual currency ’ curious : ‘ information enables person entity access digital currency. ’ What kind information ? This seems unusually vague broad . Isn ’ webpage explaining trade bitcoin ‘ information ’ would enable person access digital currency ? ” Beitchman credits crypto companies generally imaginative marketing innovative technology says : “ ... time , cryptocurrency businesses forced focus brown-bag aspects long-term self-sustaining financial services businesses . These include focus operations , administration , compliance legal . I expect see portions sector embrace development parts either ignore avoid , peril. ” Evan Thomas , practices compliance law Toronto , told Bitcoin Magazine : “ Speaking , regulations undoubtedly significant implications many cryptocurrency blockchain businesses. ” Thomas also reiterated regulations clear things like defining virtual currencies . The language used could mean whole raft businesses deal value transfer services. “ The commentary draft regulations suggests ‘ dealing ’ activities ‘ include virtual currency exchange services value transfer services , ’ many businesses , miners , mining pools developers tokenized applications , could considered ‘ dealing virtual currencies , ’ depending phrase interpreted , ” said.Scott agrees language could considerably clearer : “ The biggest issue I see definitions interpreted broadly . Unfortunately , regulators sometimes get focused ‘ letter ’ rather ‘ intent ’ regulations . In practice , means Department Finance n't tighten wording provide additional exclusions , business models n't really present much money laundering terrorist financing risk ( like in-game tokens ) things already regulated ( like securities tokens ) may swept in. ” What Happens Now ? There 's 90-day comment period , Department Finance redrafts final version . Once published , 12-month transition period compliance , meaning likely take least 15 months longer everything fully force.Even though draft , Scott noted , final versions regulations like usually similar draft version. “ I n't think 're likely see substantial shifts , real opportunities refine content ( better definitions , exclusions things n't captured , etc . ) interested companies organizations. ” Beitchman ’ view likely significant challenge crypto community types financial services may better able afford make presentations Department Finance . He suggested significant issues could arise resolved courts next 5–10 years regulatory litigation proceedings. “ Advocacy lobbying activity highly sophisticated business strategy requires clear vision , funding either large market share wide-spread consensus , ” said . “ While I hopeful positive dialogue Finance , certainly challenges advancing cryptocurrency interests here. ” “ You also look sectors traditionally large advocacy lobbying presence financial services consider whether sectors may participating comments process , ” added.Scott ’ company , Outlier Solutions , active comment process : “ I expect 'll spending next 90 days telling people panic . We participate number industry groups submitting comments , well behalf . We 've also set survey community members want comment may reticent names attached comments ( personal information required ) . ” In informal statement made Yahoo Finance ’ All Market Summit : Crypto , William Hinman , United States Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) ’ director corporate finance , indicated regulatory agency plans deem ether security. “ ... based understanding present state Ether , Ethereum network decentralized structure , current offers sales Ether securities transactions , ” Hinman said speech summit.Along ether , Hinman stated SEC would classify bitcoin security , either . Rather , cryptocurrencies function similar commodities like gold , silver oil , agency believes.But coins created equal , Hinman expressed speech , SEC ’ leniency crypto ’ top assets ’ relieve tokens scrutiny . Tokens Initial Coin Offerings , continued , likely considered securities . The distinction lies asset offered sold public. “ … strictly speaking , token — coin whatever digital information packet called — security … But way sold — part investment ; non-users ; promoters develop enterprise — , , context , often , security — evidences investment contract , ” Hinman stated.This analysis seems prioritize circumstance semantics deeming token ’ securities status . Projects often dance around token ’ nomenclature avoid self-branding something could seen security , Hinman conveyed SEC ’ fooled verbal footwork . He made clear speech “ simply labeling digital asset ‘ utility token ’ turn asset something security … economic substance transaction always determines legal analysis , labels. ” Hinman appeared contradict dove analysis token sales likely falling blanket securities , dismiss ether classification . But absolution comes “ putting aside fundraising accompanied creation Ether , ” said , token coin ’ deemed security central organization company directing launch. “ Can digital asset originally sold securities offering eventually sold something security ? ” posits , eventually concluding . “ But cases longer central enterprise invested digital asset sold used purchase good service available network created ? I believe cases answer qualified ‘ yes. ’ ” The speech shed substantial clarity question loomed industry time : namely , whether ether would ruled security . And , speech sure quell anxieties enthusiasts investors alike , leaves gray area open SEC color treatment individual token coin Hinman ’ interpretation.Still , developments positive industry , context United States , made slow crawl toward regulatory legitimacy. “ We glad SEC agrees long held analysis securities law applies decentralized cryptocurrency networks like Bitcoin Ethereum , ” Coin Center Executive Director Jerry Brito said statement . “ We thrilled see take strong pro-innovation approach nascent technology . With guidance , SEC showing taking pro-innovation approach come expense protecting investors. ” While words carry weight one SEC ’ highest officials , ’ worth noting spoken somewhat informally may represent cohesive message across SEC ’ regulatory staff.This morning , Valerie Szczepanik , SEC ’ first crypto czar , issued looks like caveat front , stating panel summit individual staffer comments may wholly line SEC ’ official stance.On June 14 , 2018 , Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) director corporate finance made waves cryptocurrency space commented Yahoo Finance ’ All Market Summit : Crypto ether security . The statement carries weight.His words led flurry speculation potential implications means Ethereum well larger cryptocurrency ecosystem regards development regulation.It noted shifting status regulatory terms confusing contrary logic programming languages cryptocurrencies use . As result , Adam B. Levine dedicated much Episode # 371 show , Let ’ Talk Bitcoin , clearing misconceptions SEC ’ stance . To , invited lawyer programmer Stephen Palley in-depth interview.Discretion Legal WorldLevine began reading abridged version SEC director ’ speech , dubbed , “ When Howey Met Gary. ” Next , Levine spoke Palley hammer speech stating . In speech , Director William Henman recalled 1946 Supreme Court ruling SEC v.s . W.J . Howey Co. , first laid terms defines asset , land purchases services contracts , government regulated Securities Act.Under act , form contract less importance actual economic substance transactions . This means number assets still qualify securities long fulfill certain qualifications.Qualifications include : Assets specifically promoted group controlling interest daily operations ; Assets purchased consumers reasonable expectation profit ; andAssets wherein significant asymmetry information promoters purchasers asset.Securities regulations primarily exist ensure third party , namely regulatory entity , well-informed enough judge reasonable guarantee safe investment , without compromising trade secrets promoter firms want made public.Furthermore , Henman stated decentralization offered cryptocurrency models ether prevent single promoter entity actually gaining significant leverage information control consumers would need protection . This means certain applications cryptocurrencies sold securities , format require level regulation.A Legal PerspectivePalley , practicing lawyer 20 years , explained concerns made possible ruling particularly sticky world cryptocurrencies . Palley claimed specific types legal contracts similar executable programmable code , yet legal verdicts operate sufficiently complex way . Legal verdicts require contextual considerations must made technical form well economic realities various interactions . This ambiguity often understood programmers , legally , uncharitable interpretation ruling applied unilaterally.Palley gave example comparing factors make ether security conceivably making ripple qualify security . Evidence original developers Ethereum largely distanced project form distinct entity still invested profit daily operations platform . Ripple , hand , still one entity . Ethereum also held back much smaller percent ether tokens developers Ripple held onto enough tokens retain controlling interest . For reasons , easily observed asymmetries Ripple platform could well classify assets securities.The Future Crypto-Based Tort ActionPalley went ruminate implications recent lawsuits Tezos might future civil suits cryptocurrency developers . Using inside experience practicing lawyer working cryptocurrency space , Palley stated many civil class-action suits unable find plaintiffs even event potentially dubious actions simple reason one wants sue firm continuing make money . After , tort actions nature typically take place attempt jump potential violations regain lost investment money damages investments longer profitable.Palley claimed lawsuits Tezos fall category . He stated Tezos conducted business enough good faith plaintiffs allege business model somehow improper , rather Tezos specifically engaging improper decisions micro-level . Under trend , Palley speculated significant factor uncharitable interpretations cryptocurrency-related laws take place market contracts space whole.The Maltese Parliament approved three cryptocurrency blockchain bills next efforts make Malta one desirable locations setting blockchain enterprises.According legislative records , bills , introduced parliament Parliamentary Secretary Financial Services , Digital Economy Innovation Silvio Schembri , approved unanimously Tuesday , June 26 , 2018.The bills detail regulation ICOs cryptocurrencies process setting crypto-based businesses Malta .

The proposal question calls listing trading SolidX bitcoin shares , stems VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust , states invest “ bitcoin only. ” VanEck SolidX first joined forces early June . This former ’ third attempt build bitcoin investment project ground up.CEO Jan van Eck commented , “ We believe collectively , build something may better constructs currently making way regulatory process . A properly constructed , physically-backed bitcoin ETF designed provide exposure price bitcoin , insurance component help protect shareholders operational risks sourcing holding bitcoin. ” The SEC asking comments Trust ’ newly proposed regulatory changes “ interested persons. ” Though several companies tried list bitcoin ETFs , concerns regarding cryptocurrency ’ liquidity consistent price swings led rising concern amongst SEC representatives , make listing process difficult long-winded.This may change future , however , officials working new plan would ease present legislation boost low-risk ETF approval rates . The new laws would allow companies sell ETFs “ launch plain vanilla versions ” without requesting obtaining approvals respective SEC regulators . Officials say hoping increase innovation competition financial industry removing current blockades.This plan would apply strictly open-ended ETFs — funds bear restrictions limits number shares issue — already make ETF space . However , issuers would still required obtain permission SEC sell funds Investment Company Act 1940.Commissioner Kara Stein explains , “ The rule would also include many website disclosure requirements existing orders disclosing ETF ’ current net asset value per share , market price premium discount. ” The proposal garnering praise several figures organizations finance industry like Investment Company Institute , based Washington . Representatives trade group commented ’ favor regulated funds , stating , “ Investors — asset managers serve — deserve uniform ETF regulatory framework . The time right codify orders single rule. ” The Maltese Parliament passed three bills law establish regulatory framework country 's blockchain sector , Malta Today reports.Just last week , Parliament “ unanimously voted ” approve bills second reading . The bills include Malta Digital Innovation Authority Act , Innovative Technological Arrangement Services Act , Virtual Financial Asset Act.Silvio Schembri , Parliamentary Secretary Financial Services , Digital Economy Innovation , shared update Twitter new development , believes make Malta “ first world jurisdiction provide legal certainty space. ” “ The 3 Bills regulate DLT [ distributed ledger technology ] approved Parliament enacted law , ” tweet reads.The blockchain bills designed make Malta hotspot blockchain cryptocurrency companies . Schembri believes attract new businesses put investors ’ minds rest.While celebrating new milestone update shared Twitter , Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said new laws make Malta “ global hub market leaders ” blockchain industry.According Muscat , new legislation proves Malta first country globally “ holistic legislative framework ” regulating blockchain space . Blockchain companies legal tools necessary operate forward-looking , regulated economy , prime minister added.With new blockchain laws , Malta distinguished among world 's friendly blockchain jurisdictions taken yet another step becoming world ’ blockchain island.The Maltese government working different avenues apply blockchain technology public service . Earlier year , partnered Omnitude improve transport system using DLT . In past , government conducted feasibility study using blockchain technology record academic certificates.Many crypto blockchain businesses already set shop Malta , well . The notable ones include OKEx , Binance BitPay.Yesterday , Congress addressed two full hearings ’ time start taking closer look digital assets , including cryptocurrencies , impacting U.S. marketplaces.The following condensed information run-down House Committee Agriculture U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) discussed hearings regarding cryptocurrency distributed ledger technology ( DLT ) .Congress Has Vested Interest Securities Economic GrowthSome might find odd see House Committee Agriculture represented hearing digital assets related technologies . But Chairman Michael Conaway made clear House Agriculture Committee , explaining vested interest shaping constructing definition security directly impacts definition commodity.Working tandem , Chairman Conaway Ranking Member Collin Peterson identified five main goals clarifying blockchain industry regulation : Promoting safe , efficient transparent tokens marketProper regulation ’ always mean intrusive regulationIdentifying whether tokens securitiesParsing whether current laws appropriate applyEnsuring enough oversight help space grow responsiblyUnderstanding Why Blockchain Technology Is ValuableThe panel witnesses sitting Capitol Hill presented in-depth yet simplistic explanations needs done . Applying proposals , however , entirely different conversation.Observing Communities Using Technology . According Joshua Fairfield — William Donald Bain Family Professor Law Washington Lee University School Law Staunton , VA — potential value blockchain technology considerable.First , technology allowed collaboration among communities artists.Second , new forms corporations begun rise up.Third , fast low-cost check settlement opportunity , helps pave way immediate payments.Fourth , digitizing securities , helps place everything easily accessible format participants.Fifth , open low-cost electronic mortgage secure transactions filing systems place helps ensure recording process deeds property-related documents secure.Sixth , provides secure international remittances.Lastly , potential bring voting system onto blockchain helps minimize potential fraud-related incidents , recently witnessed Russia 2016 presidential election .Expanding Online Property Rights Vital Growth Innovation “ Citizens need want expansion personal property rights online , ” emphasized Fairfield . He went question whether U.S. Securities Exchange Commission ’ ( SEC ’ ) Howey Test still appropriate standard apply . Instead , Fairfield proposed simplistic test — “ duck ” test . “ I believe look outer bound figure beneficial damaging uses technology presents , ” explained . “ Look communities using — regulate. ” The Evolution Tangible Property Intangible PropertyFairfield pointed personal property difficulty entering digital space . “ We ’ much personal property online , ” stated. “ Consider people used record collections — subscription Spotify . People used bookshelves — Kindle accounts. ” But behavior attributed early days internet , primarily movements like Napster , Limewire , Kazaa online torrents . This led intellectual property ( IP ) owners show concern illegal copying distribution work . “ It took several decades develop technology like blockchain , could traded , held , bought sold — duplicated , ” explained Fairfield.The law professor concluded proposal stating tokens ’ used security commodity , rather way represent property interests rights online — let . Harmonizing Technology With Our Constitutional Rights . The next witness , Amber Baldet , CEO co-founder Clovyr , emphasized importance balancing value technology need protecting consumers national security.Take Cautious Approach Thoughtful , Innovative TechnologiesThe biggest takeaway Baldet ’ proposals need understand strike balance technology still respecting constitutionally protected rights . She emphasized “ technologies might disrupt business add complexity regulating internet , ” potential represent critical infrastructure publicly shared good.What ’ Next Killer App ? According Baldet , biggest application blockchain market money — specifically , concept peer-to-peer ( P2P ) payments . “ These P2P payments grow daily part professional personal lives , ” said.As begin looking different payment instruments , must go back fundamentals ensure understand purpose “ bearer instruments. ” These documents entitle holder rights ownership title underlying property , shares bonds . If injecting blockchain technology cryptocurrency space , becomes even relevant , technology applied many things mortgages , securities , collectibles , IP rights personal data . In way , new payment systems accompanying currencies serve unique “ digital bearer assets , ” Baldet described.Observe Other Countries ’ BehaviorsWhile U.S. government accompanying marketplace struggling understand apply technological frameworks , areas world beginning embrace industry despite gray areas learning . Take Malta Switzerland , example . Malta already earned name world ’ blockchain island , Zug , Swiss city south Zürich , called “ Crypto Valley ” plethora blockchain companies operating limits.In addition , Baldet also pointed countries like Afghanistan handful African countries looking capitalize new technology . For example , Afghanistan , blockchain technology helped people like Roya Mahboob , CEO co-founder Digital Citizen Fund , enroll 9,000 Afghan women girls education programs . In efforts empowering women start businesses , next steps begin putting Bitcoin conferences help showcase projects.Blockchain Technology Is Not Answer Every ProblemMost important , Baldet wants world recognize blockchain panacea . “ When comes electronic voting , need take extreme caution , ’ ready tackle complex computer science coordination problem , ” explained.Why Venture Capitalists Can Benefit . “ Crypto networks offer new way build digital services like internet application may exist today , ridesharing applications social media applications , ” said Scott Kupor , managing partner Andreessen Horowitz Capital Management , explaining venture capitalists interested “ crypto networks ” relate crypto ecosystem.Historical Precedent Is Good IndicatorAccording Kupor , success community-based networks traced back two major movements — open-source movement open-protocol movement . The open-source software movement started back 1983 considered somewhat radical notion time.Why relevant ? Kupor goes explain.A community developers would publish software offer freely others modify incorporate projects . “ This led copyright initiatives , ” explained Kupor . Today , open source primary development software utilization data center , Linux- Android-based applications . “ This extremely relevant thinking potential crypto networks , platforms able support variety DApps [ decentralized applications ] open-source ethos encourage open innovation. ” On hand , open protocols structural foundation internet familiar today . The idea behind protocols protocol ’ change would provide steadier process comes understanding software infrastructure operates.Introducing Tokens Into New GenerationTokens ’ exist prior generations , allowing direct financial incentive community members develop govern networks appropriately . “ It ’ glue binds members community provides incentives market participants , ” said Kupor . “ Understandably , creates whole new set challenges regulators , consistent recent statements SEC. ” Kupor ended proposing framework needs developed requires risk taking , time , provides clarity certainty market participants , results market integrity.Education Is Key : Don ’ Be Foolish Dismiss Tech . Daniel Gorfine , CIO CFTC director LabCFTC , emphasized need us continue studying learning keep pace ever-evolving field. “ Given potential tokenize broad range economic assets , important remind public digital assets also commodities derivatives , depending term structured , ” explained Gorfine. “ Given potential challenges , CFTC chairman made clear proper response regulators dismiss entire movement misguided foolish , rather take time learn facilitate promise , guard risks bad actors , ” continued.Opening Finance Sector Up Blockchain . The former CFTC chair , Gary Gensler , provided five reasons believes blockchain technology make real difference finance sector : It lowers costs risks financial sector.By bringing world public policy frameworks , minimizes chances illicit activities , ensures financial stability protects investors consumers.The SEC CFTC role play , evidenced notices enforcement actions.The ICO market ripe scams frauds , bad actors found use new currency , including state actors — e.g. , recent news 12 alleged Russian officials , talks Venezuela attempting raise money oil outrunning U.S. sanctions policy.There gaps laws , first foremost , cryptocurrency exchanges attempting act state money transmitters , similar Western Union MoneyGram operate . This work due complexity traceability issues associated exchanges.Additionally , lack brokered access , ’ brokers sending issuing 1099-B ’ individuals . It ’ issuers securities space coming field , slow rate.Finally , unregulated , underlying crypto cash market mess , becomes difficult CFTC able predict future patterns behaviors.Gensler ended statement proposing question whether CFTC agency given additional authority regulate underlying cash crypto market , believing CFTC best suited task.At end long day hearings , Congress seemed receptive idea new technology , still concerned ensuring properly regulated appropriate . To view hearing full , watch here.When SEC announced rejection Winklevosses ’ latest bitcoin ETF filing , industry found reckoning problem repeat : striving toward goal approval , another Exchange Traded Fund ( ETF ) proposal faced SEC ’ death knell.At point industry ’ development , securing ETF become space ’ institutional albatross , elusivity hangs successive rejection . The recent filing Winklevosses ’ second attempt list bitcoin-backed ETF , first shot last year.Earlier year , dozen ETF filings , like Van Eck Associates Corp. , never even made discussion table SEC withdrew applications consideration January . Decisions another five filings delayed September . Lacking approvals , industry ’ institutional market offerings come form CBOE ’ CME ’ futures contracts.The market ’ slow march toward establishing bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund Exchange Traded Product ( ETP ) become reminder space still midst growing pangs , ’ even salient reminder wheels regulation spin slowly — always every industry ’ favor.SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce thinks wheels turning bit quickly . Recently sworn commission appointment President Trump , Peirce partake SEC ’ 3-1 vote strike latest proposal , ’ kept expressing disagreement commission ’ decision . She took Twitter day announcement , linking dissenting public statement.In following interview Commissioner Peirce , Bitcoin Magazine delves dissent , uncovering decision means future regulation take SEC give bitcoin ETFs/ETPs nod approval.Bitcoin Magazine : What key factors made dissent SEC ’ ruling vote “ yes ” ETP ? Hestor Peirce : So , I n't vote yes originally I n't — I got six seven months ago , lot happened staff level get kicked commission , happened . What made vote commission ? There three things playing that.One , I disagree read statutory mandate . The way I read mandate , approved one really ’ looking underlying markets way order put last week.Second issue , I think institutionalization space would address concerns lay order.And third thing , I think , historically , SEC great innovation , welcoming innovation , , order perpetuated concerns regard . We need willingness welcome new approaches I ’ worried keep sending message ’ open hearing people new ways things , people say ’ going take business another country.BM : In dissent , talk SEC playing gatekeeper bitcoin market . Is decision setting disconcerting precedent , giving SEC power deem ’ considered asset , seen kind behavior ? HP : I actually think ’ happened context , ’ happened prior orders well ; however , cases , approved . But even past , ’ looked underlying commodities markets , I think walks us road ’ want go ’ go down.You know , particular case , ’ lot said bitcoin . It new type asset , I think played decision ultimately made . I ’ worried , looking underlying markets , ’ opened worms ’ want open , ’ assess underlying markets different types assets.I think ’ great precedent . It plays bit thread securities regulations — federal state level — ’ inclination among regulators almost step shoes investor say whether investor making particular decision , based assessment actual product — case , actual asset . So yes , disturbing precedent , I ’ make assessments things.There lots people spending lots time thinking new asset class able make decisions . I ‘ stand shoes say , “ I see future better see future , I assess going better assess going. ” So yes , I ’ worried SEC putting shoes investors , . Because frankly product comes market , investors might decide , “ We ’ interested it. ” There lots things investors going look look ETP — products different . There different characteristics , let ’ put . As long disclosure good long exchange manage trading product , let ’ put let ’ let investors vote based whether buy it.BM : To extent SEC decision show lack trust self-regulatory bodies , least industry ? HP : Well , I mean , I think show bit lack trust existing SROs , meaning exchanges . In case , I ’ say , look , exchange thought product wants list , ’ gone thought process addressed concerns product trade , ’ done job , let go forward.In terms bitcoin market generally , concern order ’ approach says , “ Look , markets ’ regulated. ” To extent ’ true , regulated governments ; Gemini exchange regulated state level.But point often gets lost discussions regulations ’ actually lot self-regulation , formal SRO context , I ’ listened lot discussions factions crypto world ’ criticizing , sometimes openly harshly , ’ calling things.That kind healthy , transparent , private regulation relevant discussion , extent someone going engage manipulation market , players market — whether gold cryptocurrency — players market care affect . So sort natural push regulation grows organically within marketplace.I think order give enough attention fact , especially bring institutions market like , ’ going pressure privately monitor . It ’ self-regulation much ’ watching competitors doing.BM : Not much self-regulation self-preservation , ways.HP : In ways , right.BM : It ’ bit catch-22 , ’ ? The SEC essentially saying , “ The market ’ regulated enough , ’ start regulating it. ” HP : Yes . You know , one degree , bit logic . I reaction . The counterpoint I would offer ’ got futures markets , markets still relatively new , markets develop , ’ see institutionalization regulation.So different avenues arrive regulation , ’ part I trying get institutionalization qualm dissent : If really want market orderly , ’ got let forces going bring order . [ Here ’ ] another interesting point : I think people Bitcoin community would welcome ETP ’ precisely point wanted decentralized financial system , [ one ] involve traditional players financial market.BM : The SEC , understandably , leading efforts regulate crypto industry . Are federal departments agencies believe could picking slack give industry clarity regarding legislation ? HP : The problem regulatory jurisdiction , something like ETP , ’ game town . You know , ’ totally true could go different country folks done . But ’ talking U.S. , outside ETPs , people thinking ICOs . [ ICOs ] something address , whether something ’ security.So I think really role play , positive side — know , I ’ fairly negative SEC stuff — positive side , Valerie Szczepanik focusing cryptocurrency issues division corporation finance . She someone quite knowledgeable . From people I ’ talked outside agency work crypto space , ’ quite comfortable top staff regulator space quite knowledgeable . I think positive trend going , well.That said , I think point good one , regulators looking space generally . There ’ CFTC , ’ Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ’ sandbox . There different ways , I think part ’ going work fellow regulators part problem ’ clear regulatory box things fit . I think needs cross agency work encourage process.Look , technologies stay ’ going figure build regulatory framework build existing regulatory framework make sure products people designing people thinking possible use cases come get guidance operate within legal parameters.BM : In dissent , write “ order analyzes ETPs legal regulatory framework derived prior approval orders commodities different characteristics. ” In opinion , bitcoin wider crypto market ’ spawned deserve regulatory guidelines ? Do need write new playbook new market ? HP : Is asset class need design new regulatory framework ? Maybe , maybe ’ best approach . To extent something offered actually security probably regulate such.The questions people “ How long security ? ” “ How trade way line securities laws ? ” I tend think — I ’ open convinced otherwise — I tend think right approach work existing securities law framework . To extent something commodity , work commodities law framework see whether areas need provide guidance update rules accommodate difference.BM : It ’ something lot us space juggle around get frustrated see appear antiquated guidelines imposing rules something completely new . And certain areas little cut dried securities.HP : To point , extent specific guidelines running proving problematic engaging legitimate activity , I ’ like hear . Because ’ often talked broad strokes.I ’ like know : What particular issues ’ running giving concern ? That ’ really helpful think areas may need update rules issue guidance make work.BM : In dissent , write “ finally approve ETP bitcoin ... ” You ’ say . Do believe inevitable ? HP : [ Laughing ] I ’ bit optimistic.BM : Perhaps inevitable probable ? HP : Well , reason I anticipate ’ probable ’ lot investor demand . And I think point help push agency . When point come , I ’ speculate on.BM : Do think surveillance-sharing agreements going large part ? HP : Well , order focus surveillance-sharing agreements something looking , though I ’ know order ’ authors would say ’ approach approval.We consider facts circumstances , . So I ’ speculating particular product , I think interest area I ’ hopeful , ultimately , ’ able get approval.Coinbase announced renewed money transmitter license Wyoming three years terminating activities state .

We seek excellence compliance advocate common-sense policies allow innovation . We continue collaborating legislators regulators across U.S. worldwide work create open financial system world. ” The United States Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) hurry review pile Bitcoin ETF filings accumulating past year.Not three weeks since postponing decision five Bitcoin ETFs , SEC indicated public statement delaying decision approve reject SolidX Bitcoin Shares late September. “ Accordingly , Commission , pursuant Section 19 ( b ) ( 2 ) Act , designates September 30 , 2018 , date Commission shall either approve disapprove , institute proceedings determine whether disapprove , proposed rule change ( File No . SR-CboeBZX-2018-040 ) , ” statement reads.Submitted back June , proposed rule change permit ETF comes Chicago Board Options Exchange ( Cboe ) , cleared list Bitcoin futures December last year . If approved , ETF would listed Cboe ’ BZX exchange cooperation legacy investment management company VanEck crypto startup SolidX . This VanEck ’ second attempt list Bitcoin ETF first attempt nixed SEC last year.This also BZX exchange ’ second attempt secure Bitcoin ETF listing . On July 26 , 2018 , day SEC prolonged deliberation Direxion Asset Management ’ five filings , SEC rejected BZX ’ joint filing Winklevoss twins . The ETF rejected grounds BZX “ met burden Exchange Act Commission ’ Rules Practice demonstrate proposal consistent requirements Exchange Act Section 6 ( b ) ( 5 ) , particular requirement rules designed prevent fraudulent manipulative acts practices. ” With successive rejection prolonged decision , industry continues fight uphill battle regulators secure first exchange traded fund . Many believe listing would open floodgates institutional money.SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce believes could also invite mature regulation , private public sectors . On latest rejection SEC , expressed Bitcoin Magazine decision “ great precedent , ” believing SEC ’ decision misconstrues commission ’ purpose protect investors method decide ’ legitimate investment.The regulators awoken . SEC Director William Hinman introduced novel concepts securities law analysis sellers digital assets may escape valve . Yes , even initial sale triggered securities laws , later sales may . The industry move forward without careful exploration concepts.First order business : Can digital assets change colors ? As outlined Global Digital Finance , digital asset financial asset token ( potentially coded security ) , payment token ( Hinman used term “ coin ” ) , consumer token ( Hinman used term “ token ” ) . The relevant question whether asset change token type , whether latter two types — “ coin ” “ token ” Hinman ’ words — ever become securities.Whisky Security ? Director Hinman ’ discussion Scotch proves instructive.The SEC director carefully teased distinction consumer item manner sale . The ultimate takeaway : Whisky never security , sale trigger securities laws . It would ridiculous say whisky morphs security sold ; always remains non-security consumer item.Replace “ whisky ” “ coin ” “ token ” logic remains sound . It makes sense , , say consumer payment token morph security . That , unless code changes code represents stock another type security instrument.This semantics ; precision matters . Following logic , developers need fret job . So long developer creates consumer payment token , developer create security anything morph one . Activity outside coding makes securities laws applicable . This distinction give comfort builders . Code without worry.Activity outside coding makes securities laws applicable.Anyone wants sell , however , worry . The sale may inadvertently trigger securities laws . Purchasers sale form expectations . The sales process must manage expectations buyers think profit managerial efforts others.Hinman ’ GuidanceDirector Hinman ’ remarks provide principles follow anyone attempting “ coin ” “ token ” sale rests outside securities regime . Keep mind planning sale.Find users.In Howey , promoters sold orange groves “ hotel guests , farmers. ” If farmers bought orange groves worked land , Howey test would exist . Find farmers . Find users use network . This help preserve argument sold “ participants need functionality network digital assets offer. ” Build something real , something useful.The Howey analysis weakens purchasers consume buy . A network real use looks less like involves investment contract . The following facts indicate buyers intend consume tokens network : marketing targets actual users , buyers represent use tokens , buyers purchase limits , buyers financial incentive hodl.Cultivate distributed village.Director Hinman said “ sufficiently decentralized ” network may need benefits disclosure regime . Combine prior research Hinman ’ suggestion Bitcoin Ethereum sufficiently decentralized networks practical guidance emerges : Any network node participation geographic distribution least distributed Bitcoin network considered sufficiently decentralized.Reward volatility may vary small miners without making network insufficiently decentralized.The presence centralized mining power ( even 61 percent weekly mining power split three miners ) make network insufficiently decentralized.The presence powerful core developers influential foundation make network insufficiently decentralized.An open-source , proof-of-work network may sufficiently decentralized inception.All counsels toward creating global , well-distributed network . How measure decentralization , especially genesis proof-of-stake delegated proof-of-stake networks , remains open question ripe no-action letter request.Share secret sauce.Hinman argued decentralization correlated reduction information asymmetry promoter purchaser . Yet decentralization information asymmetry may coexist small set developers actually understand changes made decentralized network . Disclosure helps , resolve , asymmetry . Only consumer education can.As matter policy , however , would difficult regulator argue purchasers need protection disclosure regime developers disclosed everything . Layering disclosure regime onto completely transparent project would , Hinman ’ words , “ add little value. ” Disclosure helps , resolve , asymmetry . Only consumer education can.The suggestions align surprisingly well core philosophical tenets held proponents decentralization . But without clarity “ sufficient decentralization , ” token sales risk violating securities laws . Fortunately , SEC expressed willingness work industry participants . Companies take advantage rare offer shape securities laws apply foreseeable future.Some crypto industry ’ biggest exchanges joining Winklevosses effort bring self-regulation market many perceive fly-by-night unstructured.Five months following creation , Virtual Commodity Association ( VCA ) onboarded Bittrex , bitFlyer USA Bitstamp , site update reveals .

Just day , SEC put five ETF decisions backburner September , going weeks later delay yet another ETF month , well.With rejection Winklevoss ETF , SEC suggested bitcoin markets feature enough structure regulatory safeguards merit approving ETF , decision one commissioner believes sets disconcerting precedent playing gatekeeper signaling investors markets deems legitimate.Creating body deal issue industry self-regulation play well regulators ; furthermore , also signal institutional investors crypto market starting mature ready enter next phase growth.Maria Filipakis also announced VCA interim executive director . Formerly executive deputy superintendent New York Department Financial Services ( DFS ) , Filipakis key drafting implementation New York BitLicense regulations . The body also independent board mandate establish framework crypto industry best practices.John Roth , chief compliance ethics officer Bittrex , commented new body improve credibility industry eyes regulators. “ The blockchain industry must focus protecting customers operating responsible manner significantly increase adoption globally . By working VCA , advance shared goals improving transparency , accountability , security across virtual currency trading platforms. ” Legislation Is Latest Step Propel Bermuda ’ Fintech Initiative Forward .

The country blocking access 120 offshore cryptocurrency exchanges utilized trading purposes mainland customers.In addition , officials also looking shut websites pertaining cryptocurrencies initial coin offerings ( ICOs ) , prevent businesses accepting payments digital assets.ICOs initially banned last September described “ unauthorized ” “ illegal ” fundraising activities . That month , Chinese regulators ordered cryptocurrency exchanges within country cease trading practices . This caused many ICO cryptocurrency ventures pack bags move neighboring region Singapore , boasts crypto-friendly regulation.Over past year , nearly 90 different cryptocurrency exchanges 85 ICOs shut China . The yuan-bitcoin trading pair also dropped 90 percent less 5 percent world ’ total bitcoin trades.Pan Gongsheng — heads Leading Group Internet Financial Risks Remediation — adamant cryptocurrency ban China “ right decision. ” “ If things still way beginning year , 80 percent world ’ bitcoin trading ICO financing would take place China , ” states . “ What would things look like today ?

Of three , five proposals came Direxion , GraniteShares ProShares filed two each.Unlike past ETF filings , funds intended base data bitcoin futures market , spot market . Given CBOE CME offer futures regulated trading environment , structure would seemingly address SEC ’ biggest reservation approving bitcoin ETF ; namely , underlying market unregulated.Still , recent rejections take script past . The bitcoin market , SEC claims , loosely structured lacks protections fraud manipulation merit exchange traded fund product. “ ... Commission disapproving proposed rule change , discussed , Exchange met burden Exchange Act Commission ’ Rules Practice demonstrate proposal consistent requirements Exchange Act Section 6 ( b ) ( 5 ) , particular requirement national securities exchange ’ rules designed prevent fraudulent manipulative acts practices , ” order reads.Further rationalizing decision , SEC claims none filings offered “ evidence demonstrate bitcoin futures markets ‘ markets significant size. ’ ” Market size , SEC argues , imperative establishing “ surveillance-sharing regulated market ... satisfy statutory requirement Exchange ’ rules designed prevent fraudulent manipulative acts practices , ” argument ’ issued previous bitcoin ETF rejection orders.Same News , Different DayThe slew rejections unsurprising given SEC ’ track record similar proposals.Bitcoin ETF rejections becoming par course , last month , SEC shuttered hopes Winklevosses ’ second attempt ETF , first attempt coming March 2017.Unlike Winklevoss ETF , would based prices bitcoin spot market writ large , funds proposing base prices bitcoin futures markets provided CBOE CME stock exchanges . As , though , SEC still finds markets ’ mature enough justify exchange traded product.The SEC reinforced belief quoting letter received CBOE Futures Exchange President COO. “ … ‘ current bitcoin futures trading volumes Cboe Futures Exchange CME may currently sufficient support ETPs seeking 100 % long short exposure bitcoin , ’ ” excerpt reads. “ These statements reinforce Commission ’ conclusion insufficient evidence determine CME CFE bitcoin futures markets markets significant size , ” SEC continued.With decision , SEC reinforced “ disapproval rest evaluation whether bitcoin , blockchain technology generally , utility value innovation investment , ” argument made before.Hester Peirce , SEC commissioner appointed January , however , believes SEC ’ past decision tacitly makes judgement call behalf American investors . In recent interview Bitcoin Magazine , said Winklevoss ETF rejection “ great precedent , ” arguing puts SEC gatekeeper role ’ legitimate asset. “ It plays bit thread securities regulations — federal state level — ’ inclination among regulators almost step shoes investor say whether investor making particular decision , based assessment actual product — case , actual asset . So yes , disturbing precedent , I ’ make assessments things. ” By end September , SEC issue orders another round ETFs delaying decision earlier month.The Canadian government postponed release final regulations cryptocurrency blockchain companies . The final published regulations due fall , government says ’ published Canada Gazette late 2019.Because federal government already pre-election mode ahead 2019 election , final cryptocurrency “ virtual currency ” regulations effectively put hold , leaving current regulatory regime place well 2020 , additional 12-month period publication new regulations take effect.Some companies space see positive industry ’ competitiveness government effectively backing away stricter rules proposed draft version published June 2018.Others concerned delay harm competitive position quickly growing international crypto market , countries like Switzerland Malta actively encouraging crypto businesses regulations favorable tax regime.The Blockchain Association Canada ( BAC ) told Bitcoin Magazine appreciates government proceeding caution , recognition complexities new , evolving sector. “ The decision delay proposed regulations bodes well Canadian blockchain cryptocurrency space . The government committed innovation agenda sometimes … may best observe intervene little possible , ” said BAC Executive Director Kyle Kemper.Large Volume Submissions From Crypto SectorAccording number participants , sheer volume quality comments responses industry proposed regulatory package likely contributed government 's decision hold publishing next year.Cryptocurrencies blockchain companies organizations , like Money Services Business Association , invited submit comments attend meetings Finance Canada officials.BRI Calls Central Regulatory Body Comparable SECOne set comments submitted federal finance department included report influential Toronto-based Blockchain Research Institute ( BRI ) .The BRI assembled round table 70 participants industry submitted report carefully thought , detailed recommendations.The report says ’ substantive regulatory work needs done create certainty build competitive industry , although participants called middle ground , saying : “ ... blockchain revolution unfolds , regulators would wise avoid chainsaw microsurgery could .

The regulators still learning , I assure everyone trying. ” “ My hat goes OSC Launchpad , Ministry Finance others focus market . We look forward continuing work bring opportunities Canadian businesses lead globally exciting space. ” Evan Thomas , Toronto-based lawyer working crypto startups regulations compliance , also thinks needs serious work done regulating cryptocurrencies blockchain companies.Thomas told Bitcoin Magazine : “ Delay put Canadian businesses competitive disadvantage . Other jurisdictions moving quickly establish regulatory frameworks around crypto , extent frameworks n't already exist. “ Until regulations final , challenging Canadian crypto businesses establish critical banking relationships many financial sector players waiting regulatory framework place . The longer delay , harder may industry grow meantime. ” Amber D. Scott , founder compliance consultancy Outlier Solutions Inc. , pleased government “ taking feedback stakeholder groups seriously. ” Scott told Bitcoin Magazine “ time , things stay . We advise companies start thinking resources need deploy final version published wait version deploy development things likely change point. ” In Thomas ’ view , delay hurt companies space , go ahead anyway regulate . He noted “ Canadian crypto businesses implementing compliance programs even legally required financial partners require general risk management . The longer delay , costly may re-work programs meet final regulations. ” The Venezuelan government cracking remittance payments new banking mandate , one could put country ’ Bitcoin users even tighter leash.In letter “ addressed banking institutions , ” government ordered domestic banks disclose IP addresses , financial details , transaction amounts locations citizens access banking services outside country.Per measure , Venezuelans expected “ notify [ ] banking institution [ travel ] instances prior [ departing ] , explicitly indicating destination place ( ) ” long ’ country , letter reads.If citizen fails comply stipulations , banks may “ enact special condition restricts ability client make online transactions , ” effectively locking bank accounts caught accessing services outside county . The bank required “ report policy holder ’ name ; identification resource/asset ; date place provenance ; date imposed restriction IP address access attempted ” National Entity Financial Intelligence. “ Lack compliance stated , ” letter concludes , “ result imposing sanctions accordance terms outlined legislative decree. ” An Attempt Monopolize Money TransfersThe measure , self-described means “ preserve interests users general public , ” government ’ attempt strongarm community Venezuelans migrate neighboring countries , Argentina , send money home . Their country ’ economy ravaged hyperinflation , expats seek work abroad hopes earning living wage support loved ones.It ’ citizens funneling money back country government wants police new order. “ A lot people sending money relatives Venezuela want cut , ” Venezuelan Eduardo Gómez , head support Purse.io , told Bitcoin Magazine . This strategy , continued explain , much like Cuban government ’ monopoly cross-border transaction clearing. “ If look Cuba … biggest revenue source Cuba remittances ; ’ Cubans living Florida , Miami , sending money home families . If want send money Cuba , go government sell dollars Cuban pesos. ” Venezuelan officials reaching control . In sanctioning state-approved trading houses , Gómez suggests government ’ back pocket , politicians hoping reroute remittances institutions take cut payments . The bank order means government intends coerce citizens use services.And IP addresses leverage . As order indicates , client caught accessing online banking services abroad , fails report required information bank , client could lose banking privileges.Gómez told us government already come citizens using middleman services offer cheaper money transfer services neighboring countries , citing siblings ’ use services Uruguay.This new measure look sweep ’ missed , including users well-known OTC Bitcoin exchange LocalBitcoins.With Remittances Sight , Bitcoin Users Caught Crossfire “ Bitcoin threat [ government ] people using LocalBitcoins trade money around , ” Gómez said.While Gómez admitted ’ less volume Latin America ’ LocalBitcoins hubs compared international exchange volumes , say “ volume increasing , ” become popular remittance option circumvent government-sanctioned trading houses.Expats even use service alternative foreign currency transfer intermediaries . Many Venezuelans living working Argentina , example , convert Argentinian pesos bitcoin . Using LocalBitcoins , ’ search Venezuelan trader uses bank , something tricky depending rates , bitcoin-to-bolivar liquidity transaction size . Once user finds right match , ’ give buyer bank account number — , situations , relative — settle transaction.Under government ’ new requirements , Venezuelans deposit directly bank accounts could trouble , Gómez said , could banking services shuttered account illegal use — similar consequences buyers transferring funds . If measure takes desired effect , Gómez believes could damaging ramifications Bitcoin ’ use LocalBitcoins ’ presence among Venezuelans. “ What means Bitcoin short term could take liquidity LocalBitcoins I heard rumors lot Latin American traders LocalBitcoins Venezuelans living abroad . A lot guys left country years ago , may happen lot traders ’ able log bank accounts. ” Theoretically , easy overcome . Instead transferring funds account , instance , could sent relative , instead . Gómez forecasts likely outcome — one , causes uptick LocalBitcoins ’ popularity , could lead government shut domestic access platform entirely. “ In long term , government may restrict LocalBitcoins via something like DNS blocking IP blocking restrict access LocalBitcoins Venezuela . If see lot people using LocalBitcoins circumvent IP restriction , may see threat. ” Still , action would long time coming ’ ever executed , Gómez predicts , reason LocalBitcoins cryptocurrency exchange still active country : officials use it. “ A lot people inside government use LocalBitcoins sell bitcoins earn via mining government officials mine , ” said.Even Venezuelan police raid local mining operations , government officials mine immunity , bootstrapped rigs since market ’ 2017 bull run . Seeing ’ popular among officials , Gómez thinks government leave exchange alone — , least.Bigger Than BitcoinIn talk , Gómez indicated government ’ banking order doubt create headaches Venezuelan Bitcoin users . But large , order effecting greater control aspects economy . Wrangling Bitcoin users , specifically sending money across borders , one degree control. “ Ultimately , government wants cut pie remittances , ” Gómez said.LocalBitcoins certainly cutting government ’ transaction processing profit , ’ used money transfers . Gómez also told Bitcoin Magazine Venezuelans use service check bolivar ’ rate U.S. dollar , become de facto trading standard many in-country services.Venezuelans used reference DolarToday , popular service transparent bolivar-dollar rates . But ever since rumors began spread Venezuelan government covertly purchased domain control rates , “ LocalBitcoins becoming market reference dollar , ” Gómez said . Users refer bitcoin-bolivar rate bitcoin-dollar rate arrive reliable bolivar-dollar rate.The government ’ economic war , Gómez indicated , total — one looks tighten noose around service tender works around officially sanctioned services . Given LocalBitcoins proving multifaceted tool Venezuelans use , ’ reasonable assume , popularity continues surge , government may take action.If , could completely throttle last access points Venezuelans cryptocurrency platforms services . Gómez said even though LocalBitcoins operable exchange left country , “ ’ [ still ] lack liquidity. ” In event closing , Venezuelans yet another hurdle jump attempting use crypto ; would neutralize one economic safe havens citizens left bolivar continues hemorrhage value. “ Venezuelan salaries low ’ even way people buy crypto . To put things perspective , average salary Venezuela one month work $ 1 . Can imagine ? Working full month earning $ 1 end , ” Gómez concluded talk.Bill Barhydt , founder bitcoin wallet app Abra , said U.S. Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) would approve bitcoin exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) within year financial regulator feels comfortable caliber applicants.A bitcoin ETF would allow investors purchase bitcoin funds listed regulated , legacy stock exchange . Like bitcoin futures contracts came , bitcoin ETF seen many bridge encourage institutional investors cross emerging crypto market.Speaking CNBC 's The Coin Rush , Barhydt said SEC ’ refusal approve bitcoin ETF application individuals filing , claims `` n't fit mold '' SEC “ used approving . `` Barhydt seems suggest order exchange financial organization receive approval bitcoin ETF , entity one `` looks , feels smells '' like something SEC accustomed . `` I used work Goldman Sachs , look I 'm dressed probably would n't know . So I probably , unfortunately , could n't go like I meeting SEC say I 'm applying ability issue ETF , '' added.He believes , however , SEC approve bitcoin ETF next year `` much demand '' community . `` It 's going happen next year ; I would actually make bet , '' noted.Barhydt 's comments come heels statement made Dan Morehead , CEO Pantera Capital , said bitcoin ETF approval take `` quite long time , '' cryptocurrency adoption still infancy . Morehead also advised investors focus bullish news launch ICE 's digital platform bitcoin futures.Applications ETFs met resistance every turn . The SEC rejected two funds proposed Winklevoss Twins , extended decision period listing VanEck/SolidX fund September 30 , 2018 , shot host funds filed ProShares , GraniteShares Direxion . This last round rejections , however , pending review SEC ’ higher-ups , decision made staffing level picked review Commission itself.Two securities , one tracks bitcoin another tracks cryptocurrency ether , temporarily halted U.S. regulatory watchdog due investor confusion.Starting September 9 , 2018 , Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) suspended U.S. trading Bitcoin Tracker One ( CXBTF ) Ether Tracker One ( CETHF ) September 20 , 2018 . The exchange-traded notes ( ETNs ) issued Swedish company XBT Provider AB , subsidiary U.K.-based CoinShares Holdings.Per order , U.S. brokers barred trading ETNs “ purpose facilitate sales instruments owned non-broker customers ... ” Essentially , means broker-dealers help clients exit markets liquidate positions , trading activity prohibited order expires . With caution “ broker-dealers , shareholders prospective purchasers ” “ carefully consider … information subsequently issued [ XBT Provider AB ] , ” SEC cited investor confusion primary reason restricting investor access products.The confusion sales marketing materials characterized products stringently-regulated exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) , fact , exchange-traded notes ( ETNs ) , according order.Both types securities similar allow investors participate market without purchase physical commodity . The primary difference comes risk . An ETF similar stock issuer holds asset tracks , whereas ETN like bond unsecured debt . Yet , ETNs structured investment products issued major bank , opposed asset pool , come lower level risk . Bitcoin Tracker One started trading Nasdaq Stockholm Exchange 2015 , Ether Tracker One launched October 2017.Bitcoin Tracker One listed U.S. dollars first time August 2018 , making easier brokerages offer securities American investors . Previous , investors could buy Swedish ETN product using euros Swedish kora.The trading suspension latest SEC ’ increasingly busy engagement cryptocurrency industry . In July 2018 , SEC rejected second attempted ETF filing Winklevosses . The following month , denied nine bitcoin ETF filings staff level , Commission decided review rejections re-evaluate proposals , move gave industry glint optimism hitherto fruitless effort secure institutional-grade product U.S. markets.In deems first enforcement actions , United States Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) charging two entities registration failures.First line , TokenLot LLC , self-named “ ICO Superstore , ” charged acting unregistered broker-dealer “ first case charging unregistered broker-dealers selling digital tokens SEC issued The DAO Report 2017. ” A seminal document defining ICOs tokens securities , DAO Report released July 2017 classified DAO tokens unregistered securities following infamous 2016 hack.In “ first-ever enforcement action finding investment company registration violation hedge fund manager based investments digital assets , ” SEC also charged Crypto Asset Management LP ( CAM ) operating unregistered investment company falsely branding “ first regulated crypto asset fund United States. ” CAM sole manager Timothy Enneking reportedly raised $ 3.6 million 2017 providing illegal investment management services . The company also facilitated “ unregistered non-exempt public offering ” invested roughly 40 percent funds cryptocurrencies , , upon facing action SEC , CAM terminated public offering instituted buyback investors . In addition , Enneking acquiesced SEC ’ censure agreed pay fine $ 200,000 without confirming denying charges.Facing pressure regulatory agency , TokenLot principals , Lenny Kugel Eli Lewitt , paid $ 471,000 disgorgement $ 7,929 interest , agreeing “ retain independent third party destroy TokenLot ’ remaining inventory digital assets. ” “ Without admitting denying SEC ’ findings , ” agency claims , Kugel Lewitt pay individual fines $ 45,000 “ agreed industry penny stock bars investment company prohibition right reapply three years. ” These penalties come TokenLot handled funds 6,100 clients managed 200 different cryptocurrencies process . Its business model operated trading profits taking “ percentage money TokenLot raised ICOs. ” The majority Michigan-based company ’ trading activity took place DAO Report released , ceasing February 2018. “ U.S . securities laws protect investors subjecting broker-dealers gatekeepers SEC oversight , including offering ICOs secondary trading digital tokens , ” Stephanie Avakian , co-director SEC ’ Enforcement Division said press release regarding TokenLot . “ We continue encourage developing digital asset trading businesses contact SEC staff FinTech @ sec.gov assistance analyzing registration securities law requirements. ” Earlier today , FINRA , SEC ’ self-regulatory complement private sector , filed complaint Timothy Tilton Ayre “ unlawful distribution unregistered cryptocurrency security called HempCoin , ” conjunction publicly traded company , Rocky Mountain Ayre . Both cases emblematic largely unregulated cryptocurrency industry continues grapple formal regulatory organizations popularity increases.The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ) , non-profit watchdog public brokerage firms U.S. , first run-in cryptocurrency industry . The self-regulatory organization filing complaint Massachusetts man “ unlawful distribution unregistered cryptocurrency security called HempCoin. ” Timothy Tilton Ayre , FINRA alleges , illegally associated sales publicly traded company , Rocky Mountain Ayre Inc. ( RMTN ) , marijuana industry token . Allegedly purchasing rights HempCoin June 2015 , Ayre rebranded coin RMNT-backed security , FINRA ’ complaint states.According FINRA , Ayre attempted market “ worthless ” company sell shares HempCoin advertising cryptocurrency “ first minable coin backed marketable securities. ” Heralding HempCoin “ world ’ first currency represent equity ownership ” public company , Ayre reportedly guaranteed token represented 0.10 shares RMTN.Since Ayre never registered HempCoin SEC , FINRA charging “ unlawful distribution unregistered security. ” Moreover , self-regulatory body accuses Ayre defrauding investors “ making materially false statements omissions regarding nature RMTN ’ business , failing disclose creation unlawful distribution HempCoin , making multiple false misleading statements RMTN ’ financial statements. ” FINRA explains statement filing constitute legal action . As “ initiation formal proceeding , ” Ayre respond filing requesting formal disciplinary hearing . In event Ayre ’ defense ’ hold ’ found guilty , could fined , censured , suspended barred securities industry ; relieved gains ; and/or forced pay reparations investors.The filing first action taken self-regulatory industry individual involved cryptocurrency industry , ’ first time FINRA engaged securities dispute directly relating cryptocurrency market.That said , formal regulators wrestled unregistered sale securities , even outright scams . Both FINRA SEC ’ reckoning token projects sometimes unscrupulous actors promote continues insert debate distinction utility/security tokens merit cryptocurrency regulations.In April 2018 , former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sent inquiries dozen cryptocurrency exchanges learn internal operations . Now , months investigation , New York Attorney General ’ office made findings public.A report titled “ Virtual Markets Integrity Initiative , ” released Tuesday , September 18 , 2018 , confirms many already know true : Many cryptocurrency exchanges proper consumer protections place often targets market manipulation.The questionnaire originally went 13 crypto exchanges . Ten voluntarily complied study , four respond , arguing serve customers New York . But , investigating three non-responders , New York Attorney General ’ office “ referred Binance , Gate.io , Kraken Department Financial Services potential violation New York ’ virtual currency regulations. ” Kraken , one four based U.S. , vociferous refusal respond inquiry , calling initial request “ ill-prepared ” “ overly broad fishing expedition asks questions irrelevant stated objective misses obvious questions actually would helpful. ” Report HighlightsThe report highlights three broad areas concern.First , exchanges dabble several lines business would normally carefully monitored traditional trading environment . Platforms often simultaneously offer venue exchange , perform role similar broker-dealers , act money transmitters . At time , many also large crypto holdings even issue cryptocurrencies. “ Each role markedly different set incentives , introducing substantial potential conflicts interests platform , platform insiders platform customers , ” report states . As example , report points exchange employees often trade platforms , even though may access information future trades upcoming coin listing.Second , report claims many exchanges make little effort halt abusive trading activities . “ Platforms lack robust real-time historical market surveillance capabilities , like found traditional trading venues , identify stop suspicious trading patterns , ” report says.What , often way monitor suspicious trading across multiple platforms , “ platforms seriously restrict even monitor operation ‘ bots , ’ ” report states . “ Those factors , coupled concentration virtual currency hands relatively small number major traders , leave platforms highly susceptible abuse. ” Finally , report argues safeguards customers funds “ often limited illusory. ” Exchanges lack consistent approach third-party audits serve show exchanges coins fiat money claim hold . “ That makes difficult impossible confirm whether platforms responsibly holding customers ’ virtual assets claimed. ” Concerns market manipulation cryptocurrency exchanges popping . In thinly traded markets , becomes easy so-called “ whales ” large holders move price bitcoin , cryptocurrency , whatever directly want.The report comes time U.S. Justice Department investigating crypto market manipulation , Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) rejected numerous bids bitcoin exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) basis cryptocurrency markets simply vulnerable fraud manipulation . In open letter Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) , U.S. House ’ Committee Ways Means argues tax collection body leaving investors lurch vague cryptocurrency tax codes.Authored congressional representatives Kevin Brady , Lynn Jenkins , Darin LaHood , David Schweikert Brad Wenstrup , letter , addressed Acting Commissioner David Kautter , calls IRS devise concrete cryptocurrency taxing scheme one currently enforces.Opening reference similar letter Committee sent IRS May 17 , 2017 , lawmakers opine , year later , IRS done little guide taxpayers process paying capital gains taxes cryptocurrency investments , even though ’ ramping enforcement while. “ ... IRS continues expand enforcement activities without issuing guidance taxpayers . We , therefore , write today strongly urge IRS issue updated guidance , providing additional clarity taxpayers seeking better understand comply tax obligations using virtual currencies , ” letter reads.It continues argue , since inception bitcoin , IRS “ struggled ” formulate taxation strategy accommodate cryptocurrencies . Noting agency said cryptocurrencies would taxed property 2014 , something IRS Commissioner time called “ preliminary guidance , ” lawmakers claim “ date , IRS issued additional guidance taxpayers may rely upon better understand tax obligations. ” And legislators state alone concerns . Since 2016 , letter indicates , multiple organizations contributed conversation , alluding calls-to-action The Association International Certified Professional Accountants , American Bar Association Treasury Inspector General Tax Administration IRS “ develop comprehensive virtual currency tax strategy. ” The authors state IRS , despite lack clear strategy , made cryptocurrency taxation focal point enforcement . In 2016 , instance , agency issued Coinbase John Doe Summons collect information nearly half million Americans invested cryptocurrencies 2013 2015 . In addition action , July 2018 , launched campaign target complied mandates.By failing help investors properly navigate new ground , letter draws conclusion IRS “ severely hinders taxpayers ' ability [ comply ] . ” As , calls “ IRS expeditiously issue robust guidance clarifying taxpayer obligations , ” arguing agency “ adequate time ” so.In final paragraphs , letter requests agency provide Committed additional information toward end later October 17 , 2018 . It also states Committee request Government Office Accountability audit situation glean better understanding matter.The New York Attorney General ’ office pointed finger cryptocurrency exchange Kraken “ potential ” violation state regulations . Now , San Francisco–based exchange firing back , saying appreciate sees implications illegality. “ Someone voice reason , ” Jesse Powell , Kraken ’ outspoken co-founder CEO , told Bitcoin Magazine . “ If accept corrupt practices norm , without saying anything fear unlawful retaliation , hell ? ” In April 2018 , part Virtual Markets Integrity Initiative , New York Attorney General ’ office sent voluntary questionnaire 13 exchanges part “ fact-finding inquiry. ” Kraken three exchanges chose respond. “ If want talk us , ask us phone call , fly San Francisco , invite us lunch office , ” Powell said.Fast-forward five months New York Attorney General ’ office issued report results questionnaire . Within report paragraph stating office “ referred Binance , Gate.io , Kraken Department Financial Services potential violation New York ’ virtual currency regulations. ” The implication Kraken could still allowing New York residents trade platform without proper license.Three years ago , New York instituted requirement company dealing cryptocurrency state must BitLicense . Rather apply one , Kraken , based New York time , hit road , calling law “ creature foul , cruel even Kraken possesses courage strength face nasty , big , pointy teeth. ” Now , safely tucked 3,000 miles away Bay State , Kraken still feels haunted Big Apple.NY abusive , controlling ex broke 3 years ago keep stalking , throwing shade new relationships , unable accept happily moved better without . After reading New York Attorney General ’ entire 42-page report , Powell asserts ’ “ mention evidence still business NY residents. ” ( In fact , report mentions Kraken twice , times page 2 . ) Instead , appears New York Attorney General tossing matter wall New York State Department Financial Services ( NYDFS ) see come anything.Powell doubts . “ We recently spoke NYDFS ; aware serving New York , ” said.Kraken uses five-tiered system identify clients . Tier 0 , verified email , lets clients enter site poke around . If clients want trade cryptocurrency , per Tier 1 requirements , supply “ full name , date birth , country phone number. ” At Tier 1 , exchange “ collect identity documents , ” Powell says , checks , like look person ’ IP address deduce location verify phone address . “ If checks fail info indicates user prohibited geo , required provide identity documents undergo enhanced scrutiny , ” said.Powell thinks Attorney General ’ report good highlighted important questions consumers asking exchanges . However , thinks calling exchanges chose respond questionnaire unnecessary. “ After , ” said , “ hundreds exchanges never asked named. ” Regulatory clarity U.S. important growth cryptocurrency industry — long regulation reasonable , said . “ We operate global market regulators must careful stifle domestic business giving foreign businesses competitive advantage. ” As Kraken , Powell claims exchange operates high standards . “ Much regulators imagine done already done voluntarily , ” said . “ We push back strong view regulator getting issue wrong , consumer might actually put worse position , government agency dramatically overstepping bounds. ” Powell summed : Although Kraken happy work regulators law enforcement , “ stand silently rights trampled on. ” Regardless , calling regulators , tend wield lot power space , bold move exchange contemplating listing 1,600 new coins.The newly elected co-chair Congressional Blockchain Caucus , U.S. Representative Tom Emmer , introduced trio blockchain-focused bills support development use blockchain technology digital assets . According official announcement , bills focus fostering government support blockchain space , clarifying money transmitter regulations devising tax scheme hard forked assets.A statement Emmer reads part : “ The United States prioritize accelerating development blockchain technology create environment enables American private sector lead innovation growth. ” He went add legislators need “ embracing emerging technologies ” providing regulatory framework needed technologies succeed U.S.Resolution Supporting Digital Currencies Blockchain TechnologyThe first bill expresses support blockchain technology calls “ light-touch regulatory approach ” flourish .

The Congressional Blockchain Caucus bipartisan group pro-blockchain legislators “ believe future blockchain technology , understand Congress role play development. ” A bill seeks create task force combat use cryptocurrency financing terrorism passed House Representatives . House Resolution 5036 ( H.R.5036 ) , purports establish `` Independent Financial Technology Task Force , '' sent House Representatives Wednesday , September 26 , 2018 , passed unanimous voice vote moved Senate consideration.The proposed bill , introduced Representative Ted Budd , seen positive move U.S. lawmakers , aims mitigate use cryptocurrencies terrorist financing . The task force would focus researching ways terrorism could financed cryptos propose actions curb activity.In addition creation task force , bill would also support development tools programs detect illicit use cryptocurrency.Public records Congress indicate bill passed House without contention . Seeing vote unanimous bill n't controversial one , motion reconsider laid upon table gavelled , procede vote Senate.In addition federal law enforcement studying cryptocurrencies terrorists exploiting , bill also proposes rewards provide information leads conviction involved crypto terrorism financing . These rewards paid funds seized convicts , well related fines forfeitures.H.R.5036 seen many robust version another cryptocurrency-related bill . Released earlier last year , House Representatives introduced `` Homeland Security Assessment Terrorists Use Virtual Currencies Act '' seeks make proper threat assessment use cryptocurrencies terrorists.One talking points Act way defines virtual currencies . It defines virtual currencies digital representation value functioning medium exchange , store value unit account . This broad definition includes bitcoin , ether , virtual debit card even Paypal balance.On September 23 , 2018 , Bitcoin Foundation sent letter French Parliament asking reject new crypto asset amendment proposed PACTE Bill , deals growth transformation France ’ businesses country ’ employee savings.The amendment suggested members France ’ new social liberal party La Republique En Marche ( LREM ) September 21 , 2018 . Should amendment pass , would allow French government adopt recommendations ’ known Landau report , proponent New York ’ BitLicense.Llew Claasen executive director Bitcoin Foundation . Speaking Bitcoin Magazine , states amendment wrong France leave country behind comes technological advancement blockchain crypto space. “ The amendment seeks introduce licensing requirement provider digital asset services , digital assets widely defined include crypto asset would already regulated financial instrument , including non-financial use cases , ” explains. “ The licensing regime described arbitrary far-reaching , offering certainty around regulator determine would needed get license , keep license even long would take get license . Additionally , summary suggests important reason creation regulations anti-money laundering anti-terrorist financing reason suggest crypto assets used way meaningful scale. ” Claasen says New York ’ BitLicense destroyed fair competition blockchain innovation within state . He concerned France experience results amendment garners majority approval. “ Since BitLicense introduced New York August 2015 , seven licenses issued , large , well-funded organizations , ” states . “ An entire industry packed moved New York BitLicense promulgated , happen France. ” Claasen adamant country — Europe , general — ’ need new crypto regulation , rather light hand guidance notes regulators describe desirable market behavior . He says blockchain technology new immature , final use cases best practices uncertain force rigid licensing regime . He believes regulators need spend time understanding technology works make valid decisions regarding officiated. “ Most blockchain products tend toward decentralized , private , peer-to-peer state including absence sponsor , reporting entity governing body , ” states. “ Many crypto-specific regulations assume centralized transitionary states projects reflect end state , networks regulated way one might regulate juridical natural person . They ’ , even ’ like . These networks completely different way coordinating economic activity seeks scalable , need time figure things . Bad behavior predatory market participants taken signal snuff development space. ” Founded September 2012 , Bitcoin Foundation sought bring top figures crypto community together build awareness regarding bitcoin ’ benefits , uses requirements global adoption , although somewhat spotlight recent years . Members asking French cryptocurrency experts reach assist establishing organization ’ presence country bring early end proposed amendment.Brendan Eich , CEO Brave , written letter U.S. Senate Committee Commerce , Science Transportation urging implement GDPR-like legislation United States.GDPR stands General Data Protection Regulation works secure data privacy individuals within European Union ( EU ) European Economic Area ( EEA ) . In addition , addresses exporting personal data outside two organizations . GDPR seeks give individuals control personal information simplify regulatory atmosphere international business ventures.Based San Francisco , Brave new kind browser allegedly offers users faster speeds stronger security blocking trackers advertisements . In letter , Eich describes GDPR “ great leveler ” says allowed many new businesses Europe flourish preventing larger , established corporations disadvantaging them. “ The GDPR ’ principle ‘ purpose limitation ’ begin prevent dominant platforms using data collected one purpose one end business benefit parts business way currently disadvantages new entrants , ” Eich writes. “ In general , platform giants need ‘ opt-in ’ consent purpose want use consumers ’ data . This create breathing space new entrants emerge. ” Eich says GDPR-like standards adopted several countries around world including China , Brazil , Japan , India , South Korea Argentina . Together , countries make roughly 51 percent world ’ overall GDP experienced higher levels efficiency innovation business markets.Eich believes U.S. move similar direction , country keep competitive edge affirm reputation leading global tech hub.Furthermore , suggests GDPR-like protocols establish greater trust within United States businesses customers , necessary track people ’ movements online : main reason simply generate ad-based revenue sites customers visit . Since late 2017 , approximately 615 million devices built block ads tracking activated , suggesting growing level unease distrust amongst everyday consumers. “ A GDPR-like standard United States establish foundation trust enable innovation growth , ” writes . “ This certainly applies online media advertising industry . Contrary industry colleagues , I believe tenable platform , publisher , technology vendor trade body claim must track people generate revenue advertising … Trust return GDPR-like laws begin curtail online advertising industry ’ worst practices. ” Tracking movements garner ad revenue occurs process known online behavioral advertising ( OBA ) . Data collected sites consumer visits . Ads selected display consumer based past maneuvers . Eich says OBA occurs via several third-party networks operating quietly “ opaque processes ” central authority held accountable . In words , form “ behavioral tracking , ” questions ethical safe really is.Recently , Eich filed privacy complaints Britain Ireland internet giant Google playing “ fast loose ” customers ’ private data . In initial complaint , Eich said Google offers intimate data consumers several hundred companies without knowledge auction place ads . He claims goes GDPR requirements personal data processed way consumers remain secure.In addition , Facebook height scandal earlier year revealed data firm Cambridge Analytica gathered private information millions social media users without knowledge used political purposes . Cases like suggestive tech companies garnered much power , user data usually threat compromised.Interestingly , GDPR also offers “ right erasure ” clause , subject ’ collected data immediately erased company ’ records granted information gathered unlawfully , longer needed , subject question withdraws consent data used . This could present issues blockchain-based companies , information blockchain recorded real-time ensure irrefutable evidence transactions relevant data.At time , one primary requests among investors engage crypto-transactions via blockchain improved privacy anonymity . Heightened usage privacycoins like Monero Zcash proof , means statutes similar GDPR could line ideologies privacy-focused blockchains.GDPR based standards United States initially endorsed back 1980 legislation known OECD Guidelines Protection Privacy Transborder Flows Personal Data . This legislation included definition term “ personal data ” similar offered GDPR . Also , Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) fighting GDPR-like features 10 years.Brave company stands gain little , anything , directly GDPR-like legislation implemented United States . While Brave browser protects user privacy restricts advertisements , GDPR-like legislature would simply push forward Eich company already believe : users deserve privacy online data . Eich ’ letter reiterates societies around world shifting toward paradigm level playing field internet United States follow suit.The U.S. Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) obtained emergency court order issuing stoppage recently planned initial coin offering ( ICO ) Blockvest LLC founder Reginald Buddy Ringgold III , falsely advertised token sale approved SEC.According SEC , Blockvest repeatedly violated anti-fraud securities registration provisions incorrectly claiming ICO obtained regulatory approval Commission officials . The order states Ringgold — also works name Rasool Abdul Rahim El — using SEC seal without organization ’ permission.In addition , SEC says Ringgold often touted ICO “ licensed regulated , ” promoted event false agency known “ Blockchain Exchange Commission , ” used graphics similar SEC seal boasted address SEC ’ headquarters.Robert A. Cohen , chief SEC Enforcement Division ’ Cyber Unit , comments , “ We allege ICO using SEC seal made-up crypto regulatory authority trick investors believing ICO approved regulators . The SEC endorse investment products , investors highly skeptical claims suggesting otherwise. ” Furthermore , Ringgold accused misrepresenting Blockvest ’ alleged ties National Futures Association ( NFA ) continuing use group ’ seal assorted documents marketing materials , even representatives sent cease-and-desist letter requesting discontinue statements regarding Blockvest ’ connections NFA.The order seeking return gains obtained false misleading tactics , along interest penalties . The SEC also working bar Ringgold participating securities offerings , including digital securities , future . The organization frozen Ringgold ’ assets , hearing scheduled October 18 , 2018 , examine whether freeze continue preliminary injunction issued.The incident serves proof SEC playing hardball digital asset space . Recently , SEC — along Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) Federal Bureau Investigation ( FBI ) — took firm action 1pool Ltd. , brokerage firm based Marshall Islands , CEO Patrick Brunner . The SEC alleged venture trading security swaps customers across globe failing meet “ discretionary investment threshold ” required federal securities law . The SEC seeking penalties “ permanent injunctions ” company.Previously , SEC set new precedent charging smart contracts payments system TokenLot LLC operating unregistered broker-dealer first case kind , following release SEC ’ DAO Report back July 2017 . TokenLot later made pay nearly $ 500,000 disgorgement , along nearly $ 8,000 interest fees.The SEC also charged Crypto Asset Management LP ( CAM ) operating unregistered investment firm inappropriately calling “ first regulated crypto asset fund U.S. ” Nouriel Roubini , economist best known predictions 2008 housing bubble , Peter Van Valkenburgh , Coin Center ’ director research , testified U.S. Senate Committee Banking , Housing Community Affairs hearing cryptocurrency blockchain October 11 , 2018. “ We need sort static , ” said Banking Committee Chair Idaho Republican Mike Crapo , describing need better understand opportunities challenges cryptoland . The testimony comes time bitcoin lost two-thirds value since beginning year U.S. regulators trying figure regulate thousands ICOs flown face decades old securities laws.Roubini wasted time firing salvos . He called crypto “ mother father scams [ busted ] bubbles. ” Among list criticisms : blockchain overhyped ; Bitcoin scale decentralized ; criminals terrorists use bitcoin ; crypto libertarian ’ dream ; utility tokens return us Stone Age . “ Even Flintstones knew better crypto — used clamshells one currency , ” said , one bewilderingly anachronistic statement.In stark contrast , Van Valkenburgh hailed bitcoin “ revolutionary ” ability function payment system without trusted middleman . He referred bitcoin ’ underlying technology “ computer science breakthrough ” par internet . Pointing breaches Equifax , Swift DYN last two years , called blockchain technology “ best hope ” secure systems . The two testimonies followed questions senators . When asked factors hindered broader adoption blockchain technology , Van Valkenburgh said actual use cases “ hard challenges ” compared blockchain technology email 1970s. “ It took 20 years systems friendly enough consumers want use send messages , ” said.Roubini , usual gloominess , said government bank would want use public blockchain , risky . “ The idea decentralization never going fly , ” said . When asked examples world better blockchain technology , Van Valkenburgh cited one example : In Afghanistan , country men control finances , woman named Roya Mahboob able use bitcoin pay female employees. “ I n't think world better , ” Roubini grimaced . He pointed M-Pesa , mobile money transfer service widely used Kenya , example system transformed fintech . M-Pesa centralized use blockchain . Van Valkenburgh called M-Pesa WeChat , app used mobile payments China , “ tools totalitarianism ” allow governments access user data.The topic crime came several times hearing . Van Valkenburgh agreed one senator ’ comments criminals often early adopters new tech. “ In fact , I think criminals ’ using technology , technology worth anything , ” Van Valkenburgh said . Bitcoin notably used Silk Road , defunct online dark market . He also made clear bitcoin transactions traceable , many Silk Road drug traffickers caught brought justice.When asked bitcoin would ever move beyond five transactions per second , Roubini replied proof work , never , scalable. “ We lot , ” Van Valkenburgh said , pointing Lighting Network , layer two payment solution bitcoin . Coin Center even M & M machine rigged Lightning Network , said . It allows anyone Coin Center office buy single M & M tiny fraction bitcoin.Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren asked decentralization inherent property blockchain technology . Sticking script , Roubini replied : Due economies scale , single entities control majority bitcoin mining . He added situation would become worse proof stake , oligarchs would control majority coins system . Senator Warren expressed concern cryptocurrencies easy target theft lot small investors scammed initial coin offerings . “ New technologies create new opportunities , ” said . “ But careful follow old patterns — make rich richer leave everyone else behind. ” The U.S. Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) launched new office engage cryptocurrency blockchain startups .

'' Ever since U.S. Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) issued stern warning initial coin offerings ( ICOs ) February 2018 , cryptocurrency projects consider different options distributing tokens — funding development.One alternative dispersing token airdrop , tokens given ( free ) holders existing cryptocurrency . A former partner law firm Cooley LLP positive view . “ Airdrops harm . In fact , think make things better , ” Marco Santori , president chief legal officer Blockchain , bitcoin wallet provider , told Bitcoin Magazine . “ An airdrop ’ get around securities laws ; , said , unless thing ’ airdropping , token ’ airdropping , security , airdrop securities offering , ” continued . “ I think powerful tool decentralization. ” In recent interview , Santori shared thoughts raising funds future regulation.He thinks issuance framework worked Cooley called SAFT , short Simple Agreement Future Tokens , useful alternative traditional ICOs . In arrangement , accredited investors lend money project promise tokens become available network running . The SAFT white paper published October 2017 ; since , SAFT become market standard. “ I think SAFT framework probably best today , ” Santori said . “ If layer top additional clarity SEC provided context Bill Hinman ’ speech so-called ‘ Hinman test ’ incorporated SAFT framework , ’ got pretty complete picture. ” Santori referring statements made SEC ’ director division corporation finance June 2018 . At time , Hinman addressed possibility token could begin life security convert something security network became sufficiently decentralized , like Bitcoin.As far SEC goes , Santori ’ think regulator handing guidance ICO projects . “ We probably gotten informal guidance ’ going get , ” said . However , anticipate “ no-action ” relief start coming pike soon.If project uncertain whether particular activity constitutes violation federal securities laws , request no-action letter SEC . If receive relief , civil criminal action taken engaging activity . “ I expect ’ seeing SEC ’ response requests coming . And responses precedential value — legal precedent , practical precedent — ’ seeing , ” said.Existing laws likely good enough regulators , Santori thinks . “ The Treasury Department FinCEN [ Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ] , particular , stuck guns . They said laws enough ; rules enough. ” At end day , Santori feels courts make ultimate decision whether token security . “ A number lawsuits winding way federal courts today likely private lawsuits answer question first , ” said . Of course , SEC follow law like everyone else . “ The SEC plaintiff , SEC takes one position defendant decides take different position fight , ultimately ’ going courts decide civil case whether token sale security , ” said Santori . “ The SEC powerful plaintiff. ” Santori weigh airdrops future regulating cryptocurrencies along Brent McIntosh , General Counsel U.S. Department Treasury , Money 20/20 Las Vegas , October 21–24 , 2018 . The U.S. Department Treasury administers FinCEN , regulator punishes money launderers.The Securities Markets Stakeholder Group ( SMSG ) released new report suggesting European Securities Markets Authority ( ESMA ) recommend European Commission regulate cryptocurrency space existing legislation rather instilling new rules laws.The report specifies crypto assets covered Unfair Commercial Practices Directive , regulates unfair business practices European Union requires corresponding laws passed incorporate member state ’ legal system . However , cryptocurrencies covered sense entity issuing crypto asset labeled business , person purchasing consumer.The report asks several questions different classes ( payment tokens , utility tokens asset tokens ) digital monies determine whether fall present statutes . For example , asset question give owner entitlement issuer ? Is transferable ? Is scarce , scarcity controlled ? In terms payment tokens like bitcoin , report mentions presently covered Markets Financial Instruments Directive ( MiFID II ) , EU legislation regulates firms providing services clients linked financial instruments like stock shares bonds . These tokens also covered Prospectus Regulation , governs businesses ’ shareholding structures , Market Abuse Regulation . The report suggests assets bear many risks investment objects , thus authors urge EU place cryptocurrencies MiFID II control.The second class financial assets — utility tokens — completely different ballgame . These currencies classified investments , represent doorway investors access company ’ products services . Many times , utility tokens issued initial coin offerings ( ICOs ) . To raise capital , new company startup sell utility token investors , turn gain access whole new coin.Utility tokens ’ covered EU financial regulations transferable usable relationship user issuer . Thus , report says currencies covered MiFID II unless considered transferable . An example would Filecoin , builds runs distributed data applications helps build smart contracts . Thus , Filecoin potential become investment object future , case , would carry many risks traditional stocks.Lastly , report examines asset tokens , represent physical goods used finance new business projects . They also used represent titles transfers goods , recorded blockchain enlist stronger security measures receiving offering parties.To better understand tokens regulated , report examines assets financial instruments transferable securities . If token offers user financial entitlement kind , bears features bonds shares . It thus transferable — per report ’ suggestion — fall MiFID II Prospectus Regulation . Examples include EOS ERC20-based tokens , purchased traded via digital exchanges transferable rewards programs , compatible wallets participating merchants.However , asset gives right entitlement transferable ’ give holder kind decision power , shares features prepaid assets therefore warrant financial regulation future . Examples include badges statements public keys.It made clear ESMA power implement new laws regulations regarding financial instruments like cryptocurrencies , change existing laws . Thus , report meant advise ESMA discuss changes European Commission.Japan ’ Financial Services Agency ( FSA ) granted self-regulatory status country 's cryptocurrency industry , giving Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association ( JVCEA ) authority oversee space , according Reuters report.The FSA approval , granted Wednesday , October 24 , 2018 , gives association power regulate sector , safeguard customer assets , give operational guidelines , elaborate anti-money laundering policies provide necessary compliance guidelines crypto exchanges country.Reuters quoted unnamed FSA official believes industry would grow faster regulated companies operate industry. “ It ’ fast-moving industry . It ’ better experts make rules [ ] timely manner bureaucrats do. ” The new self-regulation policy effective immediately . Prior regulator ’ approval , JVCEA drawn set self-regulatory rules proposing , among measures , ban trading privacy-centric coins , Monero , crypto exchanges . Members also considering holding deposits government bonds insure digital assets.Established April 2018 , JVCEA association 16 licensed cryptocurrency exchanges Japan , launched concerted effort among exchanges safeguard investors ’ assets regain local confidence industry aftermath $ 530 million Coincheck hack Zaif hack.The association submitted formal application FSA August 2018 , asking recognition power self-regulate itself.Similar JVCEA , Virtual Commodity Association ( VCA ) launched Gemini founders Cameron Tyler Winklevoss self-regulatory organization would police U.S. virtual currency industry . The association also announced appointment former New York State Department Financial Services executive Maria Filipakis interim executive director association.On October 24 , 2018 , advisory committee Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) published report calling clarity IRS ’ position toward cryptocurrency taxation.The Information Reporting Program Advisory Committee ( IRPAC ) recently released annual report advising IRS possible areas improve tax code , specifically referring data gathered throughout fiscal year 2018.In 95-page report , multiple sections dedicated issue cryptocurrency taxation , IRPAC specifically recommending “ IRS issue guidance information reporting withholding implications cryptocurrency transactions. ” Cryptocurrency tax policy headache investors , IRS regards trade taxable event akin realizing gains investment . Perhaps due abstruse nature tax code inherent complexities come reporting trade , investors reported gains 2017 tax year.In report ’ overhead , IRPAC specifically credits IRS ’ Notice 2014-21 acknowledging virtual currency still treated property eyes federal government ’ capacity levy taxes.Nevertheless , report claims rise cryptocurrency raised questions tax regulations around nascent asset class , including whether cryptocurrency specified foreign financial asset crypto transactions must follow guidelines broker reporting.The report cites research Fundstrat Global Advisors April , estimates $ 25 billion tax liabilities within United States . The report goes state “ transactions virtual currencies difficult trace inherently pseudonymous aspect , taxpayers may tempted hide taxable income IRS. ” Needless say , large potential source taxable income would great interest IRS , report goes detail several “ general tax principles ” apply property transactions , stating would logically apply crypto asset transactions well.The report concludes cryptocurrency section referencing court ’ attempts enforce summons Coinbase , could form useful precedent dealing crypto asset holders wish avoid federal tax agents , stating “ IRPAC would interested helping develop information reporting withholding guidance important issues. ” Agents Indian government met formally discuss possible ban private cryptocurrency holdings nation.On October 30 , 2018 , Financial Stability Development Council ( FSDC ) issued press release detailing recent meeting “ reviewed current global domestic economic situation financial sector performance. ” The council seemed deeply concerned “ need identifying securing critical information infrastructure , ” guise “ strengthening security financial sector. ” To end , report mentioned deliberation “ issues challenges crypto assets/currency , briefed deliberations High-Level Committee … devise appropriate legal framework ban use private cryptocurrencies India encourage use distributed ledger technology. ” It noted council appears refer “ private cryptocurrencies ” coins operate open-source , permissionless blockchain , classification confused privacycoins , subset cryptocurrencies focus anonymous transactions.This stance different applications blockchain technology seems unfortunately common one across different major economies worldwide . Earlier year , China began make public support applications distributed ledger technology , continuing remain either silent generally negative prospects truly decentralized currency.The Indian government recently shown several indicators growing hardline stance cryptocurrency , Reserve Bank India ( RBI ) banning crypto exchanges July 2018 , proprietor Bitcoin ATM Bangalore arrested late October.Other general trends Indian policy , however , crypto speculators abroad little go . The FSDC ’ report elaborate intended meaning “ use , ” whether means proposed ban trading , holding , mining possible interactions cryptocurrency networks.It unclear extent Indian government clarify overall intentions toward cryptocurrency days come.The Securities Futures Commission ( SFC ) Hong Kong claimed include crypto funds regulatory umbrella.The SFC issued statement November 1 , 2018 , laying new approach regulating virtual assets future . The SFC granted many inherent risks investing new space like cryptoassets set address risks new regulatory action.The statement showed willingness adapt existing regulations around investing conveniently decisively affect crypto well , staying away either making sorts assets specific new class assets attempting discourage virtual assets altogether.Unlike mainland China , displayed certain aversion toward private cryptocurrencies , autonomous region Hong Kong apparently taking different approach . This led many crypto companies move mainland China , choosing instead ramp operations within region Hong Kong alone.This stance adapting laws include virtual assets asset funds reflects attitude economic model investments transactions still fundamentally , main dangers coming uncertain atmosphere new crypto markets.In addition releasing statement general intentions , SFC also released circular intermediaries day . In circular , SFC claimed “ observed investors ’ growing interest funds invest ‘ virtual assets ’ ” , end , wishes provide helpful guidance toward intermediaries.The circular included information intermediaries deal cryptoassets still remain compliant existing regulations , including series pointers fund managers daily operations , information customers privy more.From recent releases , appears SFC using status Hong Kong ’ main financial regulator create crypto-friendly environment painless manner possible , Hong Kong act favorably sorts assets immediate future. “ The GDPR , generally classical principles personal data protection , conceived world management data centralized within specific entities . In regard , decentralized model data governance embodied blockchain multiplicity actors involved processing data complicate definition roles one. ” Blockchain : Premiers éléments ’ analyse de la CNIL ( unofficial translation ) .In late September 2018 , France became first EU member state release official guidance complicated interplay General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) blockchain technology . The Commission nationale de l ’ informatique et des libertés ( CNIL ) guidance complex nuanced suggests important takeaways blockchain GDPR compliance.Takeaway No . 1 : Users blockchain solutions may considered controllers data.The CNIL guidance identifies category actors termed “ participants ” ( i.e. , initiators transactions blockchain ) rights write data chain decide submit data validation participants ( i.e. , miners “ validator nodes ” ) . Because participants deciding purposes personal data processed chosen blockchain technology means processing , CNIL remarks considered controllers.This part CNIL guidance significant positive impact various blockchain solutions — especially self-sovereign identity solutions — seek take control personal data away business entities put back hands individuals.Takeaway No . 2 : Cryptocurrency exchanges controllers personal data GDPR.According CNIL guidance , controller either ( ) natural person processing personal data professional commercial context ( b ) legal person writing personal data chain.In specific example , CNIL states “ physical person engages purchase sale bitcoin … considered controller conducts transactions course professional commercial activity , accounts physical persons. ” This statement appears put cryptocurrency exchanges squarely within definition data controller GDPR likely subjects obligations applicable controllers.Takeaway No . 3 : Miners validator nodes blockchain transactions processors personal data GDPR.The CNIL guidance notes actor merely validating transactions writing data chain another ’ direction considered processor . Therefore , persons entities operating miners validator nodes blockchain likely considered processors personal data.Takeaway No . 4 : Blockchain incompatible GDPR ’ right erasure.Despite previous conjecture blockchain ’ immutability would put forever odds right erasure , initial guidance proposes welcome middle ground.The CNIL suggests erasure personal data stored blockchain might accomplished rendering data “ almost inaccessible , therefore approximat [ ing ] effects erasure data. ” Further , destroying underlying private key value generating encrypted hashed result would “ sufficient anonymize cryptographic commitment way loses quality personal data. ” Of course , order techniques effective , personal data residing blockchain must deleted well.Takeaway No . 5 : Participants permissioned blockchain must designate single data controller risk participants deemed joint controllers.Among might classified controllers permissioned blockchain — entities determining purposes processing writing chain — CNIL offers two options : The controllers group participants may either create legal entity form association “ GIE ” ( Economic Interest Group ) , may choose one participant make data protection decisions group designate entity controller.If group chooses neither , participant considered jointly responsible controller GDPR must separately adhere applicable obligations . ( The application concept public permissionless blockchain remains unclear likely subject future guidance . ) Takeaway No . 6 : Developers smart contracts considered data processors develop smart contracts direction third party.With regard smart contracts , CNIL guidance keeps open possibility designers smart contracts either processors controllers , depending circumstances . However , guidance provides clarity citing example directly invokes real-life smart contracts pilot called “ fizzy , ” launched last year global insurance company AXA.In example , “ software developer offers insurance company solution form smart contract , allows company automate compensation passengers flight delayed . This developer viewed processor virtue insurance company , controller. ” The entity directing creation use smart contract likely deemed controller.Takeaway No . 7 : Any business looking use blockchain technology carefully assess privacy considerations going live solution.Any organization building using blockchain solutions must keep privacy compliance forefront — meeting requirements GDPR minimizing potential harm individuals . Organizations begin considering whether blockchain solution truly necessary whether result achieved traditional , centralized means . The CNIL wisely points , “ Blockchain always best technology processing data ; may source difficulties controller respect GDPR obligations. ” If blockchain technology still preferred , CNIL strongly encourages entities perform privacy-by-design analysis advance processing . The regulator repeatedly recommends developers , businesses actors undertake detailed assessment need recourse blockchain technology , privacy “ pros cons ” thereof , way personal data handled blockchain platform.It also crucial controller determine need , necessary conduct , data protection impact assessment ( DPIA ) processing operation envisioned blockchain . The DPIA allow controller later demonstrate weighed documented risks protections advance processing.Takeaway No . 8 : Permissioned blockchains minimum number nodes protect integrity blockchain data.The CNIL ’ security guidance advises blockchain operators account possibility “ 51 percent attacks , ” actors controlling half network ’ computing power would able modify prevent transactions entries chain . To prevent event , CNIL recommends evaluations performed determine minimum number miners needed mitigate risk.Still , advisable ensure blockchain adequately distributed among least minimum number independent nodes , far complex controls required guard risks related collusion consolidated control nodes.Takeaway No . 9 : Data subjects must recourse challenge outcome smart contracts — although form recourse take unclear.The CNIL ’ guidance seemingly inconsistent extent data subject able contest output smart contracts.In one sentence , guidance appears require data subjects able intervene smart contracts , stating “ data subject able obtain human intervention , express point view contest decision , contract may executed. ” In next sentence , guidance appears state sufficient allow data subject challenge smart contract execution , stating “ appropriate controller provides possibility human intervention allows … data subject challenge decision , even contract already executed. ” Perhaps thing clear scenarios smart contracts process personal data , data subject level recourse challenge outcome smart contract transaction.Takeaway No . 10 : There “ right ” “ wrong ” ways use blockchains privacy security perspective , guidance forthcoming.On October 3 , 2018 , European Parliament passed resolution titled “ Distributed ledger technologies blockchains : building trust disintermediation. ” The resolution , acknowledges distributed ledger technology “ tool promotes empowerment citizens giving opportunity control data , ” makes recommendations member states encouraging adoption best practices blockchain platforms.Both EU resolution release CNIL ’ guidance send strong signal EU , feared , decree blockchain technology fundamentally incompatible GDPR . To contrary , official actions indicate acute awareness advantages blockchain technology willingness work industry increase adoption , long participants understand may ultimately emerge right wrong ways “ blockchain ” privacy perspective.Bitcoin ATM Operator Coinsource granted BitLicense New York Department Financial Services ( NYDFS ) .Based Texas , Coinsource deploys Bitcoin ATMs key population centers across world 200 machines installed U.S. alone.CEO Coinsource Sheffield Clark called announcement “ landmark day Coinsource '' `` important win New Yorkers '' statement.In interview Bitcoin Magazine , Clark noted sees `` license validation tireless efforts offer Americans easy , convenient access evolving global financial system , also progress acceptance legitimization bitcoin valuable currency . `` The virtual currency license NYDFS allow Coinsource conduct business customers companies based state .

Having received , Clark says company feels excited granted `` prestigious license . `` `` We extremely honored receive recognition state New York applaud state dedication ensuring cryptocurrency companies regulated appropriately . `` He also spoke growth demand Bitcoin ATMs country , noted surpassed expectations firm . Notwithstanding , ATM operator 's immediate focus grow domestically expands presence 50 states America . `` Aligning blockchain ’ decentralized nature , Coinsource focuses allowing person , matter socio-economic status , technological know-how , based , access generation ’ important innovation , '' concluded.The U.S. Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) released report detailing actions taken fraudulent ICOs financial ventures , , indeed , year wrought cases . The report details actions 2018 ’ fiscal year , ended September 30 , offers insight ICO-related fraud seemingly come light past several months.Misconduct actions ICOs similar cryptocurrency ventures led organization ’ Cyber Unit , became fully operational year . The SEC explains report , “ We believe approach enforcement space thoughtful consistent . Importantly , provided template authorities countries , fraud misconduct targeting U.S. investors often based. ” The report regards ICOs “ high-risk investments , ” many “ lack viable products established track records. ” The document also says many contain shady business models unable safeguard digital assets theft hackers , others completely fraudulent operate guise garnering business capital.Since formation Cyber Unit , SEC ’ actions cyber-related misconduct increased heavily . In 2018 , organization brought forth 20 standalone cases related financial fraud , 12 ICOs digital assets . At end fiscal year , SEC states roughly 225 cyber-related investigations occurring once.One biggest cases ICO involved two individuals opened venture known TokenLot LLC , described “ ICO superstore. ” The SEC filed charges figures operating unregistered broker-dealer participating unregistered offerings , though charges later settled mid-September.The SEC also obtained emergency order halting ICO led Titanium Blockchain Infrastructure Services , Inc. president Michael Alan Stollery , self-described “ blockchain evangelist. ” That ICO raised roughly $ 21 million thousands investors , U.S. , SEC became involved received complaints Stollery lied Titanium ’ business relationships Federal Reserve several established businesses including Verizon , PayPal Walt Disney Company . Additional complaints also claimed Titanium ’ website contained false testimonials corporate customers.Other instances involved cyber intrusion broker-dealer investment advisor Iowa . The intrusion compromised personal information several thousand customers . The SEC charged firm violating Identity Theft Red Flags Rule — also known Regulation S-ID — works help protect investors risks identity theft . The SEC also charged another defendant allegedly manipulating prices Fitbit securities false regulatory filings.The SEC acknowledges ICOs become popular method raising capital startups new businesses . While representatives wish stifle innovation financial space , worked hard past several months educate investors regarding fundraising efforts may may legitimate . Methods informing investors include releasing public statements enforcing trading suspensions . The SEC also recommended enforcement actions companies seek violate registration protocols engage unlicensed broker-dealer activity.In addition , SEC implemented harder methods fighting fraud Share Class Selection Disclosure ( SCSD ) Initiative , designed swiftly identify remedy widespread financial violations . The SEC planning enforce SCSD standards ensure return substantial funds retail investors cheated fraudulent ICOs.The People 's Bank China ( PBoC ) , China 's central bank , eyes cryptocurrency companies run airdrop campaigns country.In recent financial stability report 2018 , published Friday , November 3 , 2018 , bank said surge number `` disguised '' Initial Coin Offerings ( ICO ) , including free distribution crypto tokens airdrops , despite effort clamp activities.Based report , bank states companies running token giveaways evading China ’ blanket ban ICOs issuing free tokens investor , keeping large chunk total supply speculation crypto exchange , speculation would drive prices profit.Last year , central bank banned ICOs , calling `` illegal fundraising '' targeting innocent investors . According PBoC report , ban took effect , 65 ICOs completed July 18 , 2017 , five launched 2017 . This sudden jump also attracted 105,000 investors contributed total 2.6 billion yuan ( $ 377.3 million ) , figure , PBoC states , accounted 20 percent total ICO funding raised globally blockchain startups.The central bank also made concerns known crypto firms moved operations overseas using local agents invest behalf domestic investors China . The vice governor PBoC warned foreign ICOs targeting Chinese investors separate event , earlier year . He stated time : '' Any new financial product phenomenon authorized existing legal framework , crush soon dare surface . `` Not one rest laurels , PBoC said would continue monitor crypto industry , coordinating agencies help safeguard protect interest investors.The bank 's toughened stance cryptocurrency began 2013 , published “ Notice Precautions Against Risks Bitcoin , ” bitcoin deemed legal tender China—to recent ban ICOs 2017.Since , onslaught anti-crypto measures country . Earlier year , commercial venues banned hosting crypto events , WeChat blocked high profile blockchain related accounts , Tencent , Baidu Alibaba issued statements announcing restrictions put place limit crypto-related activities platforms.In apparent first , U.S. Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) charged founder EtherDelta , Zachary Coburn , running “ unregistered national securities exchange , ” according press release regulator. “ EtherDelta provided marketplace bringing together buyers sellers digital asset securities combined use order book , website displayed orders , ‘ smart contract ’ run Ethereum blockchain , ” agency noted.EtherDelta 's users processed 3.6 million orders ERC20 tokens 18-month period , including defined securities federal securities law , SEC explained . It went argue large majority orders placed platforms `` traded Commission issued 2017 DAO Report , '' stipulated certain assets like DAO tokens securities , placing platform offered trading `` digital asset securities '' `` SEC 's requirement exchanges register operate pursuant exemption . `` EtherDelta , operates trustless exchange provides platform users trade , failed register regulator file exemption , agency stated.The release also noted SEC taken enforcement actions handful tokens traded exchange.Stephanie Avakian , co-director SEC 's Enforcement Division , spoke charges EtherDelta , arguing mandatory platform register SEC `` user interface underlying functionality online national securities exchange . `` Coburn , neither admitted denied findings agency , cooperated agency agreeing pay $ 300,000 disgorgement , well $ 13,000 prejudgment interest additional $ 75,000 fine.In latter half 2018 , developments occupied crypto investors ’ headspaces like industry ’ indefatigable pursuit bitcoin exchange traded fund ( ETF ) .This conversation lay largely dormant since Winklevosses ’ first attempt rejected U.S. securities regulator March 2017 . But twins reignited conversation second attempt ETF shot U.S. Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) July year . With buzz back , prospect ( failing prospects ) bitcoin ETF crowded headlines mainstream crypto media alike . Following Winklevosses ’ failure secure coveted first-in-the-industry fund , ensuing months would see flurry decision delays existing applications , rejections revisions said rejections.The sheer volume news surrounding ETFs — general complexity asset compared simplicity trading bitcoin spot market — makes industry ’ pursuit one rich even abstruse topic.So let ’ see set record straight.What ETF Is What It Means BitcoinTo start , short explanation : ETF fund holds underlying asset assets , stocks , commodities , bonds , etc. , divided shares investors buy . In structure , ETF functions like hedge fund , primary difference ETF traded public market like shares stock , hedge fund not.With primer mind , unpack processes jargon constitute ETF ’ many working parts.Typically , ETF features four primary stakeholders : sponsor ( entity creates ETF ) custodian ( entity stores manages underlying asset/s ) authorized participants ( financial institutions accredited individuals create redeem block ETF ’ shares ) shareholders/investors ( purchase shares open market ) More less , authorized participants sponsors charge ETF ’ supply . The participants create redeem blocks shares ( called creation units ) directly sponsor ; typically , creation units settled in-kind , meaning purchased redeemed underlying asset . Once participants purchased creation units , units divided shares traded public exchanges.For bitcoin , ETF would function similarly ETFs commodities like gold silver . Its sponsor , likely trust sorts , would employ help custodian store physical bitcoins backing ETFs ( , case futures , futures contracts ) related cash flow , would also rely eager financial institutions jumpstart circulation purchasing shares trade regulated , legacy exchange like NYSE , CME Cboe.Many investors see bitcoin ETF hitherto undiscovered holy grail institutional-grade bitcoin investments , something could push market new heights . In broader market , ETFs considered low-barrier , low-cost alternative investment vehicles like hedge funds , per rationale , community members favor bitcoin ETF say would finally give institutional investors easy , reliable access crypto market . Supporting thesis , proponents often point impacts ETFs underlying gold market , noting bitcoin would likely experience similar price stimulation.Detractors ’ think good thing . They believe , encouraging flood institutional money , bitcoin ETF would drown market inflated valuations , argument critics markets made insisting ETFs distort prices liquidity . So argument goes : Why would create investment vessel could leave bitcoin susceptible inflationary threats created avoid ? The Playing FieldThe merits either argument another article entirely , perspectives helpful understanding many players pursuing ETF ’ much noise surrounding it.The following list looks past current applications , refiled restructured initial applications rejected SEC pulled sponsors.In chronological order : Winklevoss Bitcoin TrustFile date : July 2013Status : Rejected March 2017Sponsor : Winklevoss Bitcoin TrustCustodian : Gemini ExchangeListed Exchange : Bats BZX ExchangePrice Data Source : Gemini ExchangeCreation Unit Size : Basket 100,000 sharesSolidX Bitcoin TrustFile Date : July 2016Status : Rejected March 2017Sponsor : SolidX Management LLCCustodian : SolidX ManagementOther Custodians : The Bank New York Mellon ( cash funds ) Listed Exchange : NYSE ArcaPrice Data Source : TradeBlock XBX IndexCreation Unit Size : Basket 100,000 sharesThe Bitcoin Investment TrustFile Date : January 2017Status : Withdrawn September 2017Sponsor : Grayscale Investments LLCCustodian : Xapo Inc.Listed Exchange : NYSE ArcaPrice Data Source : N/ACreation Unit Size : Basket 100 sharesVanEck Vectors Bitcoin StrategyFile Date : August 2017 ( refiled December 2017 ) Status : Withdrawn September 2017 ( January 2017 ) Sponsor : VanEckCustodian : The Bank New York MellonListed Exchange : NASDAQPrice Data Source : N/ACreation Unit Size : N/AProShares Bitcoin ETF ProShares Short Bitcoin ETFFile Date : December 2017Status : Rejected staff level appealed review Commission August 2018Sponsor : ProShares Capital Management LLCCustodian : Brown Brothers Harriman Co.Listed Exchange : NYSE ArcaPrice Data Source : Cboe and/or CME bitcoin futuresCreation Unit Size : N/AGraniteShares Bitcoin ETF GraniteShares Short Bitcoin ETFFile Date : January 2018Status : Rejected staff level appealed review Commission August 2018Sponsor : GraniteShares Advisors LLCCustodian : Bank New York MellonListed Exchange : Cboe BZX ExchangePrice Data Source : Cboe bitcoin futuresCreation Unit Size : N/ADirexion Daily Bitcoin Bear 1X Shares , Direxion Daily Bitcoin 1.25X Bull Shares , Direxion Daily Bitcoin 1.5X Bull Shares , Direxion Daily Bitcoin 2X Bull Shares , Direxion Daily Bitcoin 2X Bear SharesFile Date : February 2018Status : Rejected staff level appealed review Commission August 2018Sponsor : Direxion Asset Management LLCCustodian : Bank New York MellonListed Exchange : NYSE ArcaPrice Data Source : Cboe CME bitcoin futures exchangeCreation Unite Size : Basket 50,000 sharesOther Info : Direxion ’ ETFs would give investors option short bitcoin well giving 200 % short leveraging option 125 % , 150 % 200 % long leverage option — ETF filing accommodates leveraged shares.VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Strategy ( refiling ) File Date : June 2018Status : PendingSponsor : SolidX Management LLCCustodian : The Bank New York MellonListed Exchange : Cboe BZX ExchangePrice Data : MVIS CryptoCompare Bitcoin Index ( MVBTC ) Creation Unit Size : Basket 25 sharesOther Info : ETF backed physical bitcoin , redeemed cashWinklevoss Bitcoin Trust ( refiling ) File Date : June 2018Status : Rejected July 2018Sponsor : Winklevoss Bitcoin TrustCustodian : Gemini ExchangeListed Exchange : Cboe BZX ExchangePrice Data Source : Gemini ExchangeCreation Unit Size : Basket 100,000 sharesBitwise HOLD 10 Cryptocurrency Index FundFile Date : July 2018Status : Pendinghttps : //www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1746379/000149315218010390/forms-1.htmSponsor : Bitwise Investment Advisers , LLCCustodian : N/AListed Exchange : TBDPrice Data Source : Bitwise ’ HOLD 10 Cryptocurrency IndexCreation Unit Size : Basket 25,000 sharesOther Info : Unlike ETFs , Bitwise ’ would based 10 cryptocurrencies index fund , bitcoin.The Winklevoss Standard Rationale RejectionThe Winklevosses first try first fail filing bitcoin ETF . Naturally , set precedent contenders follow , subsequent filings submitted frontrunner ’ shortcomings mind . For SEC , Winklevosses ’ first attempt become something touchstone evaluate worth came , first rejection order cited every rejection order SEC issued since.And ’ SEC keeps running problems.In sum , problems simple . You could boil three interconnected areas concern : risk fraud/manipulation , market size lack regulation.To create ETF new asset , applicants must propose rule change accommodate asset SEC ’ legal framework , places onus applicant prove asset underlying market consistent regulations laid Security Exchange Act 1933.As rejection would indicate , Winklevosses ’ preliminary attempt ’ convincing enough SEC. “ [ The ] Commission disapproving proposed rule change find proposal consistent Section 6 ( b ) ( 5 ) Exchange Act , requires , among things , rules national securities exchange designed prevent fraudulent manipulative acts practices protect investors public interest. “ The Commission believes , order meet standard , exchange lists trades shares commodity-trust exchange-traded products ( “ ETPs ” ) must , addition applicable requirements , satisfy two requirements dispositive matter . First , exchange must surveillance-sharing agreements significant markets trading underlying commodity derivatives commodity . And second , markets must regulated , ” order reads.SolidX ’ first crack ETF would scrapped verbiage , word word , nearly three weeks following Winklevosses ’ rejection.In 2013 , Winklevosses ’ ETF filed — 2017 summarily rejected — federally regulated markets bitcoin . Of course , Winklevosses ’ Gemini Exchange regulated via New York State Department Financial Services one much-coveted BitLicenses . But scale regulation inconsequential SEC , twins ’ first application fighting losing battle start.Though June 2017 , found opening . The Cboe CME exchanges launched world ’ first institutional bitcoin futures December 2017 . By proxy , also first fully federally regulated bitcoin products trade United States.So Winklevosses took another stab , submitting revised proposal petition review . This time around , twins ’ Gemini Exchange entered surveillance-sharing agreement Cboe ’ bitcoin futures market appease SEC ’ request former rejection . As name suggests , surveillance-sharing agreement self-regulatory accord struck two marketplaces market police fraud manipulation . Sharing data monitoring practices Gemini Cboe , , would seemingly satisfy SEC ’ major concern prior application.Still , SEC impressed . In filing , Winklevosses et al . argue bitcoin market ’ global nature makes bitcoin resistant conventional mark manipulation tactics . Ironically , argument backfired , SEC found global market , Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ’ possibly shield potential investors fraud , especially consider Gemini Exchange ( would source ETF ’ price data ) accounts sliver bitcoin ’ daily transaction volume. “ BZX met burden Exchange Act Commission ’ Rules Practice demonstrate proposal consistent requirements Exchange Act Section 6 ( b ) ( 5 ) , particular requirement rules designed prevent fraudulent manipulative acts practices , ” rejection reads.Looking Toward “ Futures ” The rejection rationale detailed would copy-pasted practically verbatim nine rejection orders would come following month , August 2018.These filings Direxion , ProShares GraniteShares , however , ’ source price data underlying spot market . In fact , contracts ’ physical bitcoin — would ETFs bitcoin futures themselves.The logic pragmatic little obvious . Seeing Winklevosses rejected second time even entered surveillance-sharing agreement regulated exchange , must gone far enough . If SEC worried regulation status integrity market , ETF ( pricing data ) must based regulated market , surveillance-shared it.So Direxion , ProShares GraniteShares followed VanEck ’ footsteps , first file ETF based bitcoin futures , bizarrely , mainstream futures market even existed ( proposal initially withdrawn SEC ’ request ) .Unlike counterpart physical bitcoin ETFs , products would divide shares Cboe ’ and/or CME ’ futures contracts , naturally sourcing pricing data markets well.These ETFs claim established surveillance-sharing agreement CME ’ Cboe ’ regulated futures markets . Even , agreements must “ market significant size related bitcoin , ” eyes SEC , CME Cboe ’ yet. “ While CME [ Cboe ’ CFE ] regulated markets bitcoin derivatives , basis record Commission conclude markets significant size , ” rejection notices read. “ Publicly available data show median daily notional trading volume , inception August 10 , 2018 , 14,185 bitcoins CME 5,184 bitcoins CFE , median daily notional value open interest CME CFE period 10,145 bitcoins 5,601 bitcoins , respectively , ” continues.With data mind , SEC says extrapolating “ meaningful analysis ” market volume difficult “ reliable data spot market , including overall size , unavailable. ” Of course , rejections made staffing level pending review Commission , staff 's decision n't exactly inspire confidence , could still overturned SEC 's senior decision makers.Precedents DisappointmentsAlmost arguments ETFs make way back spot market.If ETF prices data spot exchanges like Gemini , markets small scope bitcoin ’ global trading definitively defend fraud . If ETF prices data regulated derivatives market , ’ reliable way measure significance future ’ volume overall market.The SEC ’ gravest concern deliberating bitcoin ETF approvals related fraud manipulation ; market size , asset liquidity reliability pricing data also wrapped primary concern . And concerns n't even touch custody settlement difficulties offerings would hurdle redeemed shares “ in-kind ” bitcoin ( ’ reason ( ) filings since Winklevosses ’ opted settle contracts cash , instead ) .Ironically , biggest obstacle regulating ETF existence , , current dearth regulated entities structures bitcoin market large . In interview Bitcoin Magazine , SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce hit catch-22 SEC ’ rejection creates , well explaining feels rejections set disconcerting precedent SEC 's power vet denounce quality investment. “ If really want market orderly , '' said , `` ’ got let forces going bring order , ” like institution-grade product ETF.Peirce suggested rejection Winklevoss ETF particular set poor precedent . “ It plays bit thread securities regulations — federal state level — ’ inclination among regulators almost step shoes investor say whether investor making particular decision , based assessment actual product — case , actual asset . So yes , disturbing precedent , I ’ make assessments things , ” said interview.So far , ETF news punctuated overarching disappointment , number decision-pending files still crowding SEC ’ desk . As mentioned earlier , currently , ETFs pitched Direxion , ProShares GraniteShares review Commission ; VanEck SolidX ’ joint effort , well Bitwise ’ sweeping ETF popular coins , still reviewed.This September , Abra ’ CEO Bill Barhydt told CNBC would bet ETF approved “ next year , ” Peirce said “ bit optimistic ” one coming . Barhydt believes right suitor ’ called SEC yet , , ETF inevitable , Peirce thinks ’ enough interest product eventual approval.Until eventually becomes reality , though , industry stuck waiting SEC next — something ’ become constant 2018 ’ likely change anytime soon.Today , November 14 , 2018 , New York State Department Financial Services ( DFS ) announced approved application NYDIG Execution LLC , subsidiary NYDIG LLC , virtual currency license money transmission license . The approval so-called “ BitLicense ” “ Virtual Currency License ” application 14th kind required New York State law order company engage “ Virtual Currency Business Activity. ” Under BitLicense , NYDIG Execution LLC allowed offer secure custody trade execution services , well operate custodian virtual currencies , including bitcoin , bitcoin cash , ether , ripple litecoin.DFS Superintendent Maria T. Vullo approved request , stating , “ Today ’ approval demonstrates operating within New York ’ robust state regulatory system leads stronger fintech marketplace promotes innovation necessary compliance effective risk-based controls. ” First enacted August 2015 , BitLicense regulations caused outcry community . Some industry companies Circle pursued BitLicense , others itBit ( Paxos Trust Company ) received approval operate “ chartered trust company ” DFS oversight . However , many left state accomodating jurisdictions New York Business Journal called “ Great Bitcoin Exodus , ” citing overly burdensome regulatory hurdles , excessive disclosure requirements financial disincentives pursuing license applications.San Francisco–based exchange Kraken withdrew servicing New York residents state ’ new licensing requirements . In blog post titled “ Farewell , New York , ” founders Kraken stated , “ Regrettably , abominable BitLicense awakened . It creature foul , cruel even Kraken possesses courage strength face nasty , big , pointy teeth. ” The process granting Virtual Currency Licenses slow initially , Coinbase acquiring third-ever BitLicense January 2017 , 16 months final rules around virtual currencies adopted . However , 2018 seen rise number licenses granted , nine year , seventh awarded ATM operator Coinsource two weeks ago . NYDIG ’ license comes eight months proposed alternative BitLicense regulations put forth New York State Assembly . As writing , proposed legislation still committee.Gabor Gurbacs confident approval bitcoin exchange traded fund ( ETF ) inevitable . And ’ optimistic VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Strategy first deliver one world.The director Digital Asset Strategy VanEck/MVIS , Gurbacs , late , become leading voice space ’ ETF pursuit time industry chatter topic never louder . If ’ found extolling benefits bitcoin ETF Twitter , may come across interviews Anthony Pompliano ’ podcast Ran Neu-Ner ’ Crypto Trader show CNBC Africa. “ America wants bitcoin ETF , ” told Ran Neu-Ner , “ We ’ close . It really depends SEC whether ’ going approve it. ” To find ETF , would look like bitcoin alongside VanEck vying one , check November cover story.As confident Gurbacs may appear , might say director confident surefire predictions . Historical precedent ’ exactly favor , . The VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Strategy one two proposals , Bitwise HOLD 10 Cryptocurrency Index Fund , ’ seen decision . As filings , SEC rejected nearly every proposal come across desk , although last nine rejections , made staff level , still pending review Commission.Even odds , Gurbacs believes VanEck SolidX poised buck trend , especially since asset management firm set precedent Gurbacs thinks swing odds VanEck ’ favor : history bringing institutional products market.A History Firsts “ VanEck history building international stock gold investing , U.S. abroad , ” Gurbacs said interview Bitcoin Magazine.VanEck introduced first gold equity mutual fund back 1968 ( VanEck International Investors Gold Fund , still around ) , time global gold market accounted little $ 200 million gold fixed $ 35 per ounce . Half century later — gold standard currency backing obsolete U.S. — gold $ 1,200/ounce $ 7.4 trillion market cap considered “ global safe asset , ” Gurbacs put . He attributes growth store-of-value status gold enjoyed since ’ 60s institutionalization high-grade investment assets like equity fund ETF provide market.As favoritism toward gold might betray , VanEck ’ founder , John van Eck , actually direct student Austrian-American economist Ludwig von Mises , “ one earliest gold bugs U.S. ” In 21st century , VanEck ’ pursuit finite , globally recognized asset proving generational . VanEck ’ current CEO , Jan F. van Eck , John van Eck ’ son , pioneer sorts , well , leading company introduce Gurbacs called “ first non-traditional ETFs ” U.S. market . Under direction 2006 , instance , VanEck launched VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF , “ comprehensive portfolio global gold miners , ” according VanEck ’ website.These gold-focused products successors work John van Eck built world ’ first gold equity mutual fund philosophy open attitude toward fringe assets instilled firm ’ investment vision . Now , following father ’ footsteps , Jan F. van Eck taken bitcoin similar forward-looking interest , father gold decades earlier.Jan F. van Eck , among others wider investment community , sees bitcoin “ somewhat digital gold , ” Gurbacs said , makes sense VanEck going gold efforts win SEC ’ approval world ’ first bitcoin ETF.VanEck ’ interest bitcoin also makes sense consider market parallels old world predecessor . Much like cryptographic counterpart , gold ’ first investment vehicles originally scrutinized highly volatile , speculative assets , suffering stigma similar one bitcoin faced brief , nearly 10-year history. “ Back , gold ’ sexy . It like bitcoin years ago , ” Gurbacs quipped.A Bid Make Bitcoin AppealingThe Bitcoin community crypto market whole seems clamoring ETF . But far , SEC holding giving approval.Gurbacs finds agency ’ rejections stem set problems applicants time failed address , namely “ pricing , custody , liquidity manipulation underlying asset. ” The sourcing data past filings comes markets exchanges loosely structured SEC take seriously , underlying spot market still unregulated federal level. “ Regulators keen fact spot platforms like Coinbase , Gemini like technically regulated entities really meant brokers commodities , ” said Gurbacs . “ In regulators ’ eyes , entities ’ regulated , ” even though platforms like Gemini Coinbase regulated state level New York.The cryptocurrency industry ’ spot exchanges lack many investor protections traditional markets feature regulatory default , surveillance-sharing strategies SEC said key prerequisites getting exchange trading product approved.Gurbacs explained , U.S. , equities , commodities , futures ETF market make “ market data accessible regulators subpoena flag suspicious activity. ” In attempt appease SEC , applicants began pivot toward futures market attempt give regulator asking : market fully regulated federal law.VanEck actually started trend , applying first bitcoin futures ETF tail-end last year CME Cboe began trading futures ( SEC promptly asked firm withdraw application twice ) .The nine applications rejected staff level called revival Commission September 2018 took cue VanEck , pricing bitcoin futures ETFs now-live CME Cboe futures contracts.But futures draw prices underlying spot markets popular exchanges , something played SEC staff ’ initial rejection rationale . “ CME Bitcoin futures based CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate ( BRR ) , aggregates bitcoin trading activity across major bitcoin spot exchanges , ” CME website states . For part , Cboe sources pricing data Gemini exchange , Gurbacs points accounts “ small percent daily bitcoin trading volume good day. ” So , ETFs ’ pricing sources lack regulated market structure , transaction volume slim guard manipulation , SEC ’ thinking goes . And ’ pending review Commission , Gurbacs thinks , ultimately , ’ nothing novel enough filings convince SEC change mind. “ I ’ expect SEC walk back decision 9 ETFs none providers solved problems related market structure issues SEC clearly outlined . I ’ glad ’ reviewing jobs , I ’ see change. ” Forging Way ForwardTo avoid stumbling pitfalls competitors , VanEck careful follow SEC ’ directions . In sum , involved creating market structure structural integrity one pitched SEC filings. “ We ’ met regulators times made sure understand questions , spending years — literally years — answer questions build proper market structure : ’ right pricing , surveillance place , trade institutionally , hedge market manipulation , ” Gurbacs said.These steps involve guaranteeing institutional-grade insurance fund , setting proprietary custody arrangements undisclosed bank settling ETF ’ shares cash , rather in-kind bitcoin , Gurbacs put , “ unfortunately , U.S. prime brokerage system custody system set handle physical redemption bitcoin right now. ” Proving worth SEC also means VanEck show pricing sources differ competing applicants . To clear hurdle , VanEck built pricing source ground , based feedback SEC.According Gurbacs , source draws three established over-the-counter ( OTC ) pricing feeds regulated broker dealers affiliates regulated broker dealers , though ’ disclose information currently public . However , similar index one VanEck ’ subsidiaries , MVIS , created league CryptoCompare . MVIS also features indices many mainstream investment products , Gurbacs believes bitcoin pricing feed subjects fund “ rigorous practices , regulatory-driven disclosures client protection rules ” SEC wants see bitcoin ETF.The ETF EffectThe biggest underappreciated scaling platform Bitcoin financial system.Given VanEck ’ commitment fully addressing SEC ’ feedback , Gurbacs hopeful VanEck SolidX ’ filing first win regulatory agency , attributes optimism toVanEck ’ “ half century history U.S. regulators ” working bring products market.Toward end conversation , Gurbacs reiterated company ’ history crafting first-of-their-kind products , returning VanEck ’ work sponsoring first gold equity fund nod commodities ’ similarities bitcoin . He hit meteoric growth gold enjoyed result institutionalization , stressed bitcoin could experience similar trend.But asked clarify thinks bitcoin ETF would catapult asset new heights , Gurbacs hesitated . Instead , insisted ’ price effect ETF would , rather , mean legitimizing bitcoin freeing avenues adoption. “ That ’ tough . I ’ front : I like price prediction . I ’ think ’ important part . Providing access assets regulated globally accepted way important aspect efforts . I ’ hoping impact people previously ’ get involved buying bitcoin also get market ; ’ also help adoption. “ Bitcoin need ETF , would benefit ETF . An ETF would help bitcoin survive least 100 years . And I ’ kidding . There gold trading gold fund gold ETF , first product came , gold market grew tremendously , practically $ 200 million $ 7.4 trillion , toward end spectrum ( 5-10 years ) , volatility dampened gold established global store value — government hedge , hedge global markets . Bitcoin like gold . It needs financialization order get liquidity achieve status true store value . Financialization good bitcoin . It helps liquidity , helps adoption , helps scaling . The biggest underappreciated scaling platform Bitcoin financial system. ” Bitcoin maximalists crypto community faithful might take issue Gurbacs ’ final statement . Some made argument ETF fundamentally incompatible bitcoin ’ ethos . They argued instead helping Bitcoin , ETF would actually stain industry.It seems one area bitcoiners SEC find common ground , seeing ’ likely argue bitcoin subsumed traditional financial sector . But Gurbacs , holds “ ETF , ways trust-minimized trading vehicles , ” believes ’ common ground still sides ignoring. “ We built ETF stays closer core values Bitcoin : holding physical bitcoin , providing verifiable , issued supply reserves unaccounted for. ” He added : “ Bitcoin maximalists ’ talk middle ground Bitcoin fit U.S. capital market — regulatory side , arguments also always go ’ fit it. ” Rounding talk , Gurbacs echoed Hester Peirce ’ interview Bitcoin Magazine , insisting demand ETF high ignore . He also thinks SEC would harm good restricting free-market access sounder investment vehicle currently available market. “ The SEC ’ job keep fair orderly market protect investors . Regulators n't say ‘ bitcoin good asset therefore ’ going let ETF happen. ’ They evaluate whether disclosures right let market decide whether asset merit . I think regulators made merit based decisions , regulators might implied bitcoin merit . Given new asset class , ’ little afraid. “ Right regulatory environment approving ETF fosters grey-area activity . Lightly regulated trading platforms , often operate without investors regulatory recourse , force investors grey area , versus giving something like ETF , fund structure decades history fits proper regulatory regime customer protections . My biggest frustration : possible well-constructed , insured , liquid ETF ok — ’ ok random technology companies , often license , sell bitcoin U.S. ? It ’ kind weird . So , making decision letting ETF set higher standard , gray area activity fostered whole U.S. principle free market competition also violated , SEC ’ principles protecting investors ensuring fair orderly markets violated. ” With VanEck ’ current filing slated decision December 29 , 2018 — February 28 , 2019 latest , delay — Gurbacs might get wish . Even ’ , director insinuated firm continue wrestle institution-grade product , however long may take. “ We ’ continue engage fight fight part asset manager help digital asset space mature . So may short fight — I ’ know . But done gold ’ 60s , hopefully , ’ building right basis stay true bitcoin well integrate U.S. capital markets. ” Amun AG , startup Zug , Switzerland , received license Swiss authorities offer new cryptocurrency exchange-traded product ( ETP ) .An ETP blanket term denote security derives price underlying asset ( e.g . currency , commodity , stock ) traded regulated stock exchange . It could refer number exchange-traded investment options , including exchange-traded funds ( ETF ) , exchange-traded commodities ( ETC ) exchange-traded notes ( ETN ) .Anum referred instrument ETP , ’ unclear time whether characteristically ETF , ETC ETN.Amun AG stated ETP based collection top five liquid crypto assets , refers “ HODL5. ” The currencies contained within ETP bitcoin , ether , Ripple ’ XRP , litecoin bitcoin cash . The company purchase cryptocurrency using cash customers . The assets transferred custodial hands , company charge management fees roughly 2.5 percent.The fund also sources pricing MVIS , index institutional-grade price tracking developed VanEck.Amun ’ CEO Hany Rashwan explains , “ The Amun ETP give institutional investors restricted investing securities want set custody digital assets exposure cryptocurrencies . It also provide access retail investors currently access crypto exchanges due local regulatory impediments. ” The ETP traded SIX Swiss Exchange , country ’ official stock exchange . Based Zurich , platform earned well $ 100 billion first half 2018 estimated worth $ 1 trillion.Big league financial players U.S. struggled get cryptocurrency-based ETF track years without success . Some industry ’ biggest players , like Winklevosses ’ Gemini Exchange New York , submitted applications bitcoin ETFs slapped Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) . Currently , nine applications formerly rejected SEC ’ staff pending review agency ’ Commission , bitcoin ETF pitched VanEck collaboration SolidX awaiting decision.In August 2018 , American investors given first access exchange-traded note ( ETN ) called “ Bitcoin Tracker One ” Nasdaq Stockholm Exchange Sweden , first established 2015 . Unlike ETF , issues shares underlying asset , ETN akin bond . It unsecured debt note bought traded reaches maturity date , time debt note must repaid.Prior August 2018 , investors able buy ETN using either euros kora , Sweden ’ national currency , tracker ’ USD listing paved way western interest.Less month later , however , SEC suspended American access Bitcoin Tracker One Ether Tracker One , another ETN issued Swedish company XBT Provider AB . The SEC cited investor confusion primary reason blocking investors taking part either venture.The U.S. Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) given tacit permission mining pools donate political campaigns.The FEC released memo website November 13 , 2018 , provide background information formal meeting would take place November 15 . In , addressed recent request filed OsiaNetwork LLC FEC ’ advisory opinion.OsiaNetwork filed request September 10 , 2018 , asking confirmation “ permissibility OsiaNetwork ’ business plan. ” With little information publicly available startup , seems decision may dealbreaker whole company ’ existence.This business model stated quite simply OsiaNetwork ’ request “ enable individuals support federal political committees volunteering processing power internet enabled devices mine cryptocurrencies. ” And , FEC responded.In move may spell trouble OsiaNetwork , ultimately might add dynamism space whole , FEC decided “ although proposed cryptocurrency mining pool described request permissible Act Commission regulations , activities individuals fall within volunteer internet activities exception , would therefore result contributions OsiaNetwork participating political committees. ” In words , seems permissible mining pools undertake effort donate political campaigns , still possible OsiaNetwork set mining pools , able enter kind extended relationship wherein act sort middleman.OsiaNetwork able contribute campaigns , may preclude long-term relationship pool sets . The request specifically mentioned stipulations ideal donations , “ long political committees client OsiaNetwork. ” The FEC ’ decision ban kind relationship uphold private donations may ultimately provide flexibility interested donating cryptocurrency via mining pools . OsiaNetwork ’ plan make profit scheme apparently centered around establishing institutionalized actor mining pools nature , ’ possible transactions would work fine decentralized fashion.The Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange ( GBX ) granted license Gibraltar Financial Services Commission ( GFSC ) required operate regulated blockchain exchange. “ Securing authorization DLT provider Gibraltar affirmation tireless efforts position GBX among premiere Digital Asset Exchanges globally . Today ’ announcement renews ambition create world leading , institutional-grade token sale platform Digital Asset Exchange , ” Nick Cowan , CEO GBX , said statement.Cowan went explain exchange 's goal beginning build regulated exchange `` effective risk-based controls . '' While road long difficult , endorsement Gibraltar 's financial regulator testament exchange 's long held position `` evidence hard work '' brought far.Speaking far come , took exchange roughly 180 days attain coveted license commission.There series communications regulator followed initial risk assessment application . GBX required make presentation GFSC , detailing business plan exchange plans abide Commission 's Distributed Ledger Technology Regulatory Framework.The Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange , runs initial coin offering marketplace , subsidiary Gibraltar Stock Exchange Group ( GSX Group ) . It launched 2017 GSX Group initial coin offering ( ICO ) .GBX also offers crypto trading , opened public July 2018 . Dubbed GBX Digital Asset Exchange , platform allows investors trade bitcoin , ether , bitcoin cash , ethereum classic exchange 's native token Rock Token ( RKT ) . Similar Binance Coin works , GBX traders also use RKT Coin pay trading , listing sponsor fees platform.The platform also offers fiat token trading customers , particularly USD pairs , plans widen net accommodate fiat currencies exchange well list trading pairs. “ Gibraltar found right blend sensible supportive regulation , helped position jurisdiction lodestar global cryptocurrency space , allowing blockchain companies flourish . Crucially , Gibraltar realization pursuit innovation never come expense sustainability long-term development . I look forward seeing trend continue months years ahead , ” Cowan concluded.Speaking ongoing CoinDesk 's Consensus Invest conference New York , U.S. Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) Chairman Jay Clayton spoke agency ’ yet approved bitcoin exchange traded fund ( ETF ) . But rationale behind words nothing crypto-friendly audience ’ heard before.Clayton explained agency might approve bitcoin ETF anytime soon agency 's issues yet addressed market operators . Clayton singled theft manipulation cryptocurrencies two issues need sorted commission give blessings ETF , something prior rejection orders repeated ad infinitum.In rejection orders , SEC claims applicant failed “ demonstrate proposal consistent requirements Exchange Act Section 6 ( b ) ( 5 ) , particular requirement rules designed prevent fraudulent manipulative acts practices , ” continuing say “ novel systems intrinsic new market provide unique additional protections unavailable traditional commodity markets , ” namely “ traditional means identifying deterring fraud manipulation. ” These “ traditional means ” surveillance sharing agreements , something rejection orders stress one avenues product might win approval . In talk , Chairman Clayton opined surveillance , system used likes Nasdaq investigate manipulative trading activities , could keep tabs manipulative practices ensure fair pricing.He believes investors want certain upgrades fraud protection market surveillance , `` [ ] exist currently exchange venues digital currencies trade . '' Clayton also reiterated crux SEC ’ rejections talk ; namely , underlying market fraught manipulation allow mainstream investing product , would expose investors unmanaged risks. “ What investors expect trading commodity ’ underlying ETF trading makes sense , free risk significant risk manipulation . Those kinds safeguards ’ exist many markets digital currencies trade , ” SEC chairman explained panel session moderated Silver Lake Partner 's Glenn Hutchins.Market manipulation aside , issue custody another obstacle kept ETFs seeing light day . The custody digital assets needs improve , considering wave hacks crypto thefts occurred 2018 , Clayton asserted . `` We 've seen thefts around digital assets make scratch head . We care assets underlying ETF good custody , 're going disappear . `` On issue custody , 's flurry activity crypto financial institutions alike . Coinbase launched custody solution far back August 2018 , Fidelity , crypto arm Fidelity Digital Assets , started enterprise-grade custody solution October . Not left behind , American multinational investment bank Citigroup announced plans offer crypto custody solutions September . Gemini , Ledger ItBit also working floating similar service . With number options abound , SEC chair believes room improvement.So far 2018 , agency rejected ETF application Winklevoss Twins , along nine others , rejection staffing level , currently reviewed Commission . It also postponed decision VanEck SolidX ETF case till February 2019 latest . Even spite postponement ( SEC ’ revolving door rejections cautious stance bitcoin ETF ) , VanEck ’ director Digital Asset Strategy , Gabor Gurbacs , confident VanEck ’ filing checked SEC ’ boxes.On November 27 , 2018 , California judge turned back SEC ’ request injunction token company BlockVest , company U.S. Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) pursuing allegedly conducting unregistered securities offering . The judge , however , ruled BlockVest ’ token distribution , conducted via airdrop , given freely received without expectation returns , ’ constitute investment contract.While judge ’ ruling law-binding verdict , still victory BlockVest wider ICO industry , something ’ rarity SEC ’ mounting list token sale targets.Among regulatory developments , 2018 one extended game cat mouse U.S. Securities Exchange Commission number initial coin offerings ( ICO ) sprung investing exuberance 2017 ’ bull market . And SEC catching fair share mice.Back last year ’ unprecedented boom , saw crypto market ’ assets increase threefold , many ICOs attempted evade SEC ’ scrutiny self-labeling products utility tokens . If could prove tokens built serve function rather exist investment vehicle , could avoid securities classification continue sale without registering SEC.The SEC , though , ’ buy distinction.So far year , SEC come hard handful ICOs , broker dealers , funds even exchange , slapping fines acting unregistered entities . As though symbolic culmination enforcement actions year , SEC ’ recent damning charge leveraged EtherDelta , one space ’ popular decentralized exchanges houses many Ethereum tokens whose ICOs SEC views securities offerings.A New Phase EnforcementIn correspondence Bitcoin Magazine , Jake Chervinsky , associate Kobre & Kim law firm , explained believes SEC established baseline enforcement 2018 , one sets precedent agency views burgeoning ecosystem token offerings . “ I think ‘ phase one ’ saw SEC establish fundamental views legality common issues crypto industry prosecuting small number companies individuals various industry segments , including ICO issuers , exchanges , broker-dealers , token funds . The SEC ’ goal put everyone notice conduct may illegal — example , ’ clear SEC views ICOs conducted United States unregistered securities issuances violation 1933 Act. ” Chervinsky originally posited theory SEC ’ enforcement phases Twitter thread November . In thread , suggested 2019 see phase two ; conversation , explained SEC operating unspoken expectation token projects work agency operate legally , 2018 ’ enforcement examples done talking them. “ In ‘ phase two , ’ SEC expects everyone industry come forward voluntarily work SEC make sure ’ compliance securities laws . As SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said crypto companies Consensus : Invest 2018 : ‘ Get act together ! ’ ” For fail acquiesce , Chervinsky anticipates could made examples still. “ The SEC likely prosecute companies refuse comply voluntarily . In end , SEC ’ goal bring entire industry compliance securities laws , even means dozens hundreds different companies. ” Basically , SEC ’ rationale token companies excuse register agency . They operate assumption ’ treated like security , unless prove otherwise . But onus company show ’ fit mold , simply calling offering utility token ’ cut it.Moreover , token companies library enforcements charges consult doubt securities status . Chervinsky calls “ guidance enforcement , ” old dog ’ trick SEC used past . For new industry , Chervinsky believes SEC went easiest targets set firm examples outset. “ They chose ones simply easiest SEC resolve quickly efficiently , factual allegations public cases made useful guidance rest industry. ” These examples set loose standard token projects going 2019 “ crypto industry stakeholders negotiate settlements , ” Chervinsky holds . But cautioned “ orders binding precedent. ” Indeed , Twitter thread , Chervinsky elaborates , SEC , nebulous guidance better . If SEC plays loose , get set rules terms exercise enforcement discretion . Most cases , explains , settled privately , SEC would rather avoid open litigation , court rulings could lead legal precedents would lock SEC ’ jurisdiction rigid , codified confines.As Enforcement Ramps Up , Guidance Plays Catch UpStill , Chervinsky expects “ SEC provide additional guidance time goes , likely FinHub ‘ crypto czar ’ Valerie Szczepanik ” — though ’ also certain SEC ’ hold guiding torch regulation alone . The U.S. ’ legislature , says , needs part effect proper legislative changes would allow regulations , proxy , entities regulate , operate organically within mature system. “ I think Congress — eventually need — clarify federal securities laws apply digital assets . The foundation securities laws dates back 1930s , long anyone could imagined concept digital asset issued via internet use blockchain technology . This old legal framework simply ’ designed digital age , result , ’ provide regulatory clarity crypto industry needs move forward. ” So far , benchmarks moving regulation forward : Howey Test , metric measure whether asset security defined Securities Act 1933 ; DAO Report , report released SEC DAO hack 2016 ; prior enforcement actions ; , recently , SEC ’ Statement Digital Asset Securities Issuance Trading ( something Chervinsky said “ reads like comprehensive primer types securities violations SEC wants resolve industry ” ) .Much like outdated Securities Act , Chervinsky finds various references guidance robust enough substantiate actual regulation satisfy industry ’ need clarity . And even though thinks Congress bringing table already , SEC also help industry. “ The SEC lot regulate enforcement . The SEC could issue informal guidance explaining position many outstanding questions facing crypto industry , token transforms security non-security , company conduct ICO outside U.S. borders without implicating SEC ’ jurisdiction . The SEC could also pursue official rulemaking formalize positions digital assets . This would result enforceable rules — like Regulation D private placements Regulation S offshore securities issuances — crypto industry could rely moving forward. ” He added : “ ... Similarly securities laws unclear whether SEC jurisdiction cryptocurrency exchanges initial coin offerings located physically outside U.S. borders . Given SEC ’ appear likely provide additional clarity issues , burden may fall Congress step take action. ” Heading Into New Year , Industry Has More Questions Than AnswersOther legal experts agree Chervinsky SEC , way , left investors hanging sluggish regulatory action punctuated hard-hitting regulatory charges . Some even said new Statement Digital Asset Securities Issuance Trading lays minefield digital asset industry launching companies curate it.Less minefield labyrinth , Chervinsky believes SEC ’ guidance , like clarification ether , sold security , decentralized point one , could construct maze confusion counts fully decentralized — token company supposed get first place.Chervinsky notes “ July , SEC suggested digital asset could start life security evolve non-security becomes ‘ sufficiently decentralized , ’ law ’ contemplate transformation. ” Even , prosecution ICOs , broker dealers , funds exchange EtherDelta , Chervinsky believes SEC “ made example least one target key segments crypto industry. ” The piece missing , believes , traders — engage “ acts market manipulation , including pump dump schemes , wash trading , spoofing , outright fraud. ” He believes SEC ’ gone actors insufficient market data ’ agency ’ crosshairs soon enough . ( If read heart skipped beat , ’ worry ; ’ talking traders actively commit market manipulation fraud , everyday , Dick Jane traders ) .With pieces place , Chervinsky expects 2019 somewhat open season SEC decide shirk regulatory responsibilities . But ’ mean every shot killshot . With successive enforcement , questions opened avenues interpretation traversed.In Chervinsky ’ opinion , resolution fronts slow , painful march marked combination legal battles molasses-paced legislative drafting. “ The crypto industry ’ firm standard conduct allowed ’ illegal Congress passes new legislation SEC ’ theories tested court. ” Some standards making , recent court action California surrounding BlockVest suggests . As rest , industry hunker withstand brunt ’ become slow , blow-after-blow exchange evolving regulatory landscape . But , long take note bruising set , blows become less damaging ( less frequent ) time.Global leaders walked away latest G20 Summit rough game plan crypto regulation.This year ’ G20 Summit took place Buenos Aires , Argentina , November 30 December 1. International government officials , well world ’ largest corporations including Bank America , Inter-American Development Bank , World Trade Organization World Health Organization , gathered discuss topics ranging infrastructural development sustainable food sourcing.Among topics examined summit included creation open resilient financial system followed international laws supported sustainable economic growth participants , point subject cryptocurrencies brought up.Eager battle money laundering fraud financial market , leaders explained looking imprint stronger regulatory tactics cryptocurrency blockchain businesses. “ We regulate crypto-assets anti-money laundering countering financing terrorism line FATF [ Financial Action Task Force ] standards consider responses needed , ” summary summit reads.Members also explained would explore extradition individuals responsible stealing assets regions offenses took place . Leaders summit say ’ tasking relevant international organizations reporting back similar issues next meeting.It ’ unclear whether summit ’ member countries actually adopt measure . Crypto theft specifically discussed , ’ unclear participants referring virtual currencies simply fiat examining subject asset theft.In addition , summit members acknowledged global financial infrastructure becoming digitized sought take stronger measures sustaining finance strengthening financial inclusion otherwise non-participating regions . They endorsing G20 Financial Inclusion Policy guide , seeks provide voluntary policy recommendations countries organizations looking facilitate digital financial services.The summit also focused tax efforts , mentioning working “ globally fair , sustainable modern international tax system ” based tax treaties transfer pricing rules . They welcoming international cooperation pro-growth tax policies. “ We continue work together seek consensus-based solution address impacts digitalization economy international tax system update 2019 final report 2020 , ” summary continues read , though unclear whether solution apply cryptocurrencies digital fiat currency.One biggest issues facing cryptocurrency arena tax laws clear . Many attempts made encourage governing bodies , national abroad , clarify present tax laws surrounding crypto assets relative trades.2018 hallmark year U.S. Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) ’ enforcement cryptocurrency companies , , according one director , international collaboration regulatory agencies played supporting role SEC ’ recent regulatory actions.Steven Peikin , co-director Division Enforcement SEC , credited international collaboration useful weapon agency 's arsenal bringing fraudulent unregistered actors justice . Peikin made opinion known speech delivered Harvard Law School ’ Program International Financial Systems ( PIFS ) Regulators Securities Markets December 3 , 2018.Peikin leads team attorneys accountants investigate prosecute civil violations U.S. federal securities laws . According , division `` daunting task ferreting misconduct , appropriate , recommending civil enforcement actions variously seek injunctions cease-and-desist orders , penalties , disgorgement ill-gotten gains , suspensions bars bad actors , temporary suspension delisting securities . `` They involved cases like recent settlement charges music producer DJ Khaled Floyd Mayweather Jr. , charged touting crypto offerings . The team also charged reached settlement EtherDelta co-founder Zachary Coburn flouting federal securities laws operating unregistered national securities exchange.On topic division ’ track record enforcement , Peikin praised SEC 's `` collaboration international regulators law enforcement '' critical element made possible . `` Our investigations often involve witnesses evidence different countries , transactions cross international boundaries , resulting application multiple different legal systems . `` The SEC director also highlighted separate types securities law violations Initial Coin Offering ( ICO ) space collaboration counterparts overseas helped agency protect market dubious actors.The first group includes ICOs meet criteria security violation federal securities law registration failures . The second category fraudulent ICOs issuers use `` excitement around crypto asset space simply rip money investors . `` Late last year , agency obtained emergency asset freeze Dominic Lacroix , partner Sabrina Paradis-Royer company PlexCorps marketing selling PlexCoin unsuspecting investors August 2017 . The token sale case-and-point example type blatantly fraudulent activity SEC sought punish 2018.The founders promised absurd 1,354 percent profit less 29 days , raised $ 15 million global investors . “ We learned ICO counterparts AMF [ Authorité des marchés financiers ] Quebec , provided us important evidence support complaint motion emergency relief , ” Peikin said speech . `` Staff AMF provided declarations proceeding , court relied ruling defendants , '' continued.Peikin said agency would continue work global partners develops ongoing ICO investigations . His argument shares sentiment recently held G20 Summit Buenos Aires . At summit , world leaders came together discuss , among topics , need regulate “ crypto-assets anti-money laundering countering financing terrorism line FATF [ Financial Action Task Force ] standards. ” The U.S. Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) postponed decision approve disapprove VanEck/SolidX bitcoin exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) . Per official document published agency , new deadline review VanEck proposal shifted February 27 , 2019 , regulator claims would afford time needed review potential rule change further.The SEC stipulates commission must either approve disapprove proposal later `` 180 days date publication notice filing proposed rule change . '' However , special clause permits agency extend period 60 days . Since proposed rule change initially published Federal Register July 2 , 2018 , December 29 , 2018 , would made 180 days . The extension February 27 , 2019 , falls within 60-day special consideration.The statement SEC reads : “ The Commission finds appropriate designate longer period within issue order approving disapproving proposed rule change sufficient time consider proposed rule change. ” The director Digital Asset Strategy VanEck/MVIS , Gabor Gurbacs , remains optimistic despite delay financial regulator . He sent tweet saying today 's delay expected , SEC 's concerns worked rectified form `` improvements markets pricing , custody & surveillance . `` Speaking recent event New York , SEC Chairman Jay Clayton spoke commission might approve bitcoin ETF soon . Clayton argued agency 's concerns , market manipulations , surveillance , custody , yet addressed crypto operators. “ What investors expect trading commodity ’ underlying ETF trading makes sense , free risk significant risk manipulation . Those kinds safeguards ’ exist many markets digital currencies trade , ” Clayton remarked.The National Assembly France recently shot proposals ease pressure tax regulations crypto space.As reported Bitcoin.fr , recently existed series proposals present friendlier environment cryptocurrency firms France , none able pass lower house nation ’ legislature . The report listed several proposed amendments French tax code , many hardly seem like radical ideas . For example , Amendment 399 apparently intended clarify distinctions occasional usage crypto assets routine transactions , without reference trying take advantage either classification . A similar amendment defer payment capital gains taxes crypto assets converted fiat also failed.In addition , however , substantial measures specifically intended make cryptocurrencies attractive . One proposed amendment listed figures 5,000 , 3,000 305 Euros annual tax exemptions usage cryptocurrency . None passed . Another amendment aimed allowing cryptocurrency taxation laws closely resemble traditional capital gains tax laws shuttered unceremoniously well.France ’ tax policies late captured imaginations world ’ presses . French president Emmanuel Macron attempted enact policies austerity cuts social safety nets continuing raise taxes gasoline millions French citizens consider basic necessity travel hold job.The resultant “ Yellow Vest ” riots far able overwhelm government entirely present , serve grim reminder legislature French Republic collapsed entirely multiple times within last century close calls recently 1968 . In light current events , may simply French government feeling skittish showing favoritism tax policies.In words , rejection could little overall viability cryptocurrencies France . This extremely hot time French political scene , crypto bear market may proposed amendments favors.The British government recently released policy paper clarifying tax laws crypto assets.This fairly straightforward document released Her Majesty ’ Revenue Customs ’ ( HRMC ) website , holding sundry list important crypto space terms , relevant tax codes points intersection two.The report claims “ cryptoassets sector fast-moving developing time , ” much terminology described report may situationally accurate subject change . As result , prefaces information disclaimer “ views may evolve sector develops. ” The report launches fairly comprehensive list crypto-specific terminology act primer describing situations different taxes applicable . For example , “ HMRC consider buying selling cryptoassets gambling , ” instead claims “ vast majority cases , individuals hold cryptoassets personal investment. ” There great number situational circumstances outlined document wherein investor would pay taxes . It states “ [ ] liable pay Capital Gains Tax dispose cryptoassets. ” Additionally , describes scenarios crypto gains could fall income tax even inheritance tax , latter regards crypto assets property.The document also comes complete hypothetical scenarios contingency plans investors defrauded generally seems complete guide digital asset class ’ standing U.K.Dry texts , offering clarity , also point crypto ’ legitimization eyes government . As evidenced statutes like provision crypto inheritance , example , entire departments English bureaucrats coming see crypto assets another investiture money.India could making U-turn directives cryptocurrencies . Per reports New India Express , second interdisciplinary committee set Indian government considering making cryptocurrencies legal country stringent rules.This revelation comes months government panel suggested creation new regulatory framework within Reserve Bank India ( RBI ) bans digital assets declares crypto transactions illegal India.According unnamed senior official spoke New India Express , committee met twice , deliberations still ongoing. “ We already two meetings . There general consensus cryptocurrency dismissed completely illegal . It needs legalized strong riders . Deliberations . We clarity soon. ” The first interdisciplinary committee cryptocurrency set government India back March 2017 , including Ministry Finance officials . This committee consisted various banking state departments . Following recommendation committee , RBI directed banks financial entities country refrain transacting digital assets.However , second committee , convened Subhash Chandra Garg , Secretary Department Economic Affairs , set review resolutions first look viability cryptocurrencies Indian economy.Some members second committee also attended G20 summit Buenos Aires , crypto measures taxation increased regulation combat use cryptocurrencies money laundering discussed.The members meeting January discuss insights gained summit , presenting recommendations government. “ We also taken inputs cryptocurrency exchanges experts examining legal issues law ministry . It ’ complicated issue . Once aspects decided , clarity , ” senior official explained report.While committee might suggest softening stance cryptocurrencies , local government authorities handling sector kid gloves since ban enforced.Earlier year , developers India 's first bitcoin automated teller machine ( ATM ) founders country 's first crypto exchange , Unocoin , arrested local Bangalore authorities criminal charges , including criminal conspiracy , cheating forgery.For investors whose first time investing bitcoin 2018 late 2017 , high likelihood incurred substantial losses fiscal year 2018 ’ sold yet . On December 17 , 2017 , bitcoin hit all-time high $ 19,000 . Thereafter , fallen 80 percent hovers around $ 4,000 time writing . While losing money never end goal , certain measures investors take order minimize taxable income utilizing capital losses incurred bitcoin current year going forward.Before diving measures taken , first necessary address regulatory bodies set precedences view bitcoin similar assets . Although piece centered U.S. regulatory requirements applied bitcoin , worth noting many countries similar regulations internationally.Bitcoin Is PropertyAccording Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) , bitcoin considered personal property . As , tax laws applicable sale house car , similarly , security , also apply digital currency.Specifically , IRS refers taxes levied sale asset capital gains tax , two types . Long-term capital gains tax applies profits assets held year , short-term capital gains taxes apply assets held less year . Short-term capital gains taxed rate individual ’ ordinary income tax rate , 2018 somewhere 10 percent 37 percent , depending level income . On hand , 2018 , long-term capital gains tax rates either 0 percent , 15 percent 20 percent . The applicable rate used calculation dependent level income.However , article discussing opposite gains , probably profited 2018 ’ bear market . Capital gains tax rates relevant taxing profits losses . The good news IRS allows individuals lower taxable income applying losses.If You Sold Your Bitcoin LossPlenty people bought bitcoin bull run last year . Some “ bought dip ” various points way back , see price slide even lower . And many discouraged investors sold BTC loss along way . For short-term investors , opportunity claim back losses.Similarly , investor bought bitcoin time late September ( last time prices low ) December 2017 , likely losses 2018 used lower taxable income choose sell . This would lower amount taxes owe given year , long asset ’ bought back within 30 days ( i.e . wash sale ) .According IRS , maximum amount individual offset taxable income single year $ 3,000 . But , investor lost $ 3,000 , remaining losses carried following years $ 3,000 per year.As example , investor bought 1 BTC late December $ 17,000 sold $ 4,000 today , would recognize loss $ 13,000 . The investor , assumed regular taxable income , reduce 2018 taxable income maximum $ 3,000 . The remaining unused portion capital loss situation $ 10,000 . The IRS allows $ 3,000 leftover $ 10,000 carried next year offset capital gains may recognized end 2019.The Case HodlingWhile selling bitcoin loss could reduce taxable income short term , many proponents bitcoin would quick point case holding onto digital asset much stronger selling marginal temporary opportunity save dollars taxes.There many believe bitcoin eventually become store value , sound money , best days bitcoin ’ price yet come.However , unpredictable , even , bitcoin accomplish feat . Because impossible predict short-term price movement bitcoin , could argued case holding long time ( commonly referred HODLing ) points toward much higher future price bitcoin would make selling today , relatively small , offsettable loss , much greater loss years come.Last week , two largest banking regulators within European Union released reports calling uniformity regulations crypto assets Initial Coin offerings ( ICOs ) across continent.The EBA Calls Pan-EU Crypto RegulationsOn January 9 , 2019 , European Banking Authority ( EBA ) published assessment crypto laws .

Here 's rule : rules. ” Nick Foley , former support staffer Coinbase , also stated rules required crypto already — based mathematics . Foley took Twitter downplay prospect bringing complex regulations crypto space , calling regulations unnecessary . Rules like mathematics ? Sure . Crypto needs . Rules like `` KYC AML licencing taxation Patriot Act bitlicense bullshit ? '' No . Crypto n't need that.Huobi back Japan , time fully regulated exchange Japan 's Financial Services Agency ( FSA ) .Following merger BitTrade , Huobi Japan Holding Ltd. among first batch 17 receive registration FSA able relaunch Huobi Japan.Leon Li , Huobi Group founder CEO , called launch “ important milestone ” statement , adding Japanese market remains important group working “ regulators longstanding priority Huobi Group. ” Japan 's financial regulator directed cryptocurrency exchanges registered licensed exchange agency cease operations 2017.Huobi left time , hoping merge SBI Virtual Currency , deal fell through.Following Coincheck 's hack January 2018 , FSA ramped requirements exchanges , 160 applicants waiting line approval October 2018 .

He planning contribute views part Elections Canada consultations.In U.S. , 2014 FEC ruling said political campaigns organizations could accept bitcoin donations led BitPay partner CoinVox number fundraising agencies help process donations.Jared Polis , current Governor Colorado , Mick Mulvaney , current White House Chief Staff , among first U.S. legislators accept bitcoin campaign donations.B2C2 , cryptocurrency “ liquidity provider ” electronic OTC trading magnate , recently announced British regulators given U.K.-based subsidiary approval offer crypto space new investment derivative.According press release shared Bitcoin Magazine , British Financial Conduct Authority ( FCA ) authorized B2C2 OTC Inc. “ arrange deal Contracts Difference ( CFDs ) eligible counterparties professional clients. ” The release went claim “ FCA authorisation allow clients B2C2 OTC Ltd gain exposure cryptocurrency markets via firm ’ CFDs. ” Founder CEO Max Boonen elaborated using license “ introduce cryptocurrency CFD product , ” claiming “ eligible counterparties professional clients gain derivative exposure cryptocurrency markets , benefiting competitive pricing liquidity ’ accustomed receiving B2C2 avoiding risks associated crypto custody. ” A CFD investment vehicle allows investors make contracts directly brokers/banks , instead relying open position market .

On February 2 , 2019 , Wyoming State Senate also passed bill updating classification crypto assets , including clause formally label currencies.According text bill , crypto assets considered three different statuses legal purposes : digital consumer assets , digital securities virtual currencies . All three definitions specifically registered personal property rather private property , formally upholding stance jurisdictions overseas abroad taken.More significantly , however , bill also elaborates specific terms conditions three statuses . In addition respective classifications “ general intangibles ” securities , bill also states “ virtual currency intangible personal property shall considered money. ” In redefining legal status crypto way , formally opens possibility ordinary citizens treat crypto actual currency daily basis . This , turn , could provide impetus comprehensive tax code new business use cases.Wyoming cultivating reputation major crypto United States , bid angle blockchain hub nation . In addition enabling blockchain stock certificates bipartisan support January 2019 , Wyoming also helped make banking laws friendly blockchain companies last December . Many Wyoming legislators evidently , least , sympathetic making blockchain new Wyoming industry friendliness expected future.Yet another journey launch bitcoin exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) begun.According published notice , U.S. Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) begun reviewing proposed rule change bitcoin ETF filed NYSE Arca Bitwise . The Commission 45 days date publication make final decision whether approve , reject extend rule change . Should SEC require time review proposal , extend review period 90 days , gives reasons delay.Bitwise Asset Management New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) Arca announced plans launch physically held bitcoin ETF earlier year.The fund , dubbed “ Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust , ” filed SEC January , along rule change proposal .

It rejected applications ProShares , five ETF proposals Direxion , Gemini GraniteShares . Those ’ reject , delayed , submissions subsequently withdrawn.Most recently , VanEck SolidX withdrew submission Cboe BZX Exchange , delayed SEC multiple occasions . VanEck director digital asset strategy Gabor Gurbacs explained proposal “ temporarily withdrawn ” would submitted later date , citing government shutdown factor. “ We engaged discussions SEC bitcoin-related issues , custody , market manipulation , prices , stop . And , instead trying slip something , application pulled refile SEC gets going , ” VanEck CEO Jan van Eck told CNBC.Activist group Blockchain Advocacy Coalition ( BAC ) sponsored bill California ’ 19th State Assembly District , set allow legal cannabis businesses district pay state taxes using cryptocurrency . The bill proposed Assemblymember Phil Ting February 20 , 2019.If put law , would affect California 's many cannabis businesses.Logistical Barriers : Delivering Bags CashOne prominent driving factors behind bill , decentralized nature financial blockchain technology really chance shine , fact banks lack cooperation businesses . Citing conflict federal law , many financial institutions refuse let cannabis businesses open bank accounts , thereby cutting multibillion-dollar industry using digital money transfers. “ The current recommendation state California cannabis businesses use armored vehicles pay taxes , ” said Alexandra Medina BAC . “ That ’ inefficient risky . It ’ closer one might pay taxes gold rush , stage coach gunman , would expect California accept taxes 2019. ” This current approach logistical “ nightmare cities , state businesses , ” claimed . It ’ dangerous money couriers , forces revenue agencies “ count tens thousands bills , ” causing tax offices “ smell like weed fabric softener. ” So far , little progress made alleviate situation . “ The previous state treasurer convened working group solve issue , year later report solution , ” said Medina . The physical cash transport “ problem state tried failed solve. ” Opportunities Blockchain Open FinanceMedina called new bill “ great use case blockchain open finance. ” To end , Blockchain Advocacy Coalition help educate policymakers basics digital currency blockchain technology hopes getting bill passed.The group already hosted roundtables state ’ new treasurer , Fiona Ma , Governor Gavin Newsom . “ They tech savvy innovative leaders state , ” said Medina . “ Now really good time introduce something like this. ” In grander scheme , Medina believes “ California opportunity turn around lack regulatory clarity ” serve example states Union.Getting Bill PassedAt present , getting bill passed group ’ main concern . The bill recommends using stablecoin tax payments , current form prescribing specific stablecoin . For , according Medina , bill ’ supporters “ work create standards kind coins wallets state uses make sure highest degree stability safety state businesses. ” Medina claimed group already supported two bills signed law last year . This new bill start going assembly committee ( ) March April end May pass Assembly . Then repeat process Senate ; get committee Senate floor September 13 , 2019 . If processes go smoothly , governor signs law October 13 , 2019 , Medina expects bill implemented June 2020.Medina said BAC ’ previous campaigns , 50 businesses signed support letters initiatives , group “ would like even stronger showing year. ” She added group plans organize “ blockchain education day , industry advocates meet legislators 1:1 answer questions technology bill , ” vote reaches Senate.The Canada Revenue Agency ( CRA ) apparently specifically targeting bitcoin crypto investors part broader tax strategy keep tabs cryptocurrency investments , including purchase assets.Forbes reported story early March , detailing tactics CRA , include audits questionnaires . In addition subjecting cryptocurrency investors audits , many users also sent “ comprehensive questionnaires fill regarding bitcoin-related activity past years. ” Reportedly , sixty audits actively ongoing.These questionnaires notably included in-depth sections inquiring various services obscure user ’ identity transaction history . Known mixing services , protocols CoinJoin increases person ’ privacy allowing combine transactions several users , putting several layers obfuscation sender receiver . When transactions processed using tumblers mixers like , becomes nearly impossible tell exactly sent received what.Audited users also asked several in-depth questions ability purchase bitcoin crypto assets anonymously , directly referencing services Changely ShapeShift . Notably , ShapeShift implemented KYC account registration end 2018 , longer making anonymous exchange.Other anonymous services exchange bitcoin include LocalBitcoins , utilizing non-custodial transactions . Some users leverage LocalBitcoins buy crypto grid , settling trades using hard cash organizing site ( users enter trade site use off-site methods communication settle ) . When hard cash used way , long buyer seller ’ log trade website , record buyer owning said crypto assets.Incredibly , survey also asks users “ list personal crypto asset addresses associated custodial wallet accounts. ” The CRA ’ interest services seems related potential avoiding government scrutiny . The CRA ’ Project Oversight Director Jared Adams suggested Twitter services could used money laundering . According Forbes , CRA running dedicated cryptocurrency unit since 2017 , goals ranging auditing users general gathering information crypto asset space.According CRA ’ statements , agency “ committed helping taxpayers understand tax obligations using digital currencies , remind using digital currency exempt consumers tax obligations. ” It went state audits aimed “ highest risk files , ” hope “ [ promote ] fair tax system Canadians. ” This attitude exemplary recurring problem cryptocurrencies government agencies . The anonymity included technology design makes particularly difficult tax agencies collect accurate records digital currencies , cause friction space . Cryptocurrency research firm CoinCenter , example , believes U.S. ’ tax system crypto “ broken ” shows fundamental lack understanding assets function.A bill proposed Texas legislature require receivers cryptocurrency regular transactions verify identity cryptocurrency sender accepting payment . If passed , measure go effect September 1 , 2019.In current form , text bill brief , providing clues ambitious task carried . Apart definitions basic terms , bill ’ concrete requirement “ accepting payment digital currency , person must verify identity person sending payment , ” exception made parties already using “ digital currency allows true identities sender receiver known person access another person ’ digital wallet. ” The bill also lays vital groundwork developing tools eventually carry plan . It indicates , passed , would “ Texas Department Banking , Credit Union Commission , Texas Department Public Safety , State Securities Board ” collaborate develop identification tools , cooperateion law enforcement agencies.Regulators several countries ongoing struggle reckon technology integrate financial regulations legal systems . This Texas bill , instance , could incredibly difficult enforce , even cooperation several regulatory agencies , given censorship-resistance cryptocurrency transactions.Instead trying police development cryptocurrency , states attempted accommodate cryptocurrency state ’ financial business laws . On multiple occasions , Wyoming , example , shown willingness become regional hub crypto-asset businesses . In February , state ’ legislature enacted two cryptocurrency laws , one allows individuals businesses directly crypto-assets without needing intermediary custody , one deems “ virtual currency intangible personal property shall considered money. ” As somewhat incredible cross-party cooperation politically fractious times , many crypto-friendly initiatives Wyoming received bipartisan support , bills proposed jointly representatives major parties.CipherTrace Partners Maltese Regulators Manage Risk Financial CrimesCipherTrace , blockchain analytics company , partnering Republic Malta ’ sole financial regulatory agency ensure crypto transactions within country free money laundering similar financial crimes.As Times Malta reported March 11 , 2019 , Malta Financial Services Authority ( MFSA ) enlisted help U.S.-based company CipherTrace audit cryptoasset services operate within Malta ’ jurisdiction.The MFSA require potential cryptocurrency agents , like individuals operating exchanges , wallets ICOs , formally register MFSA . CipherTrace “ provide MFSA powerful oversight tools automate regulatory processes audit risk management virtual asset businesses licensed Malta , ” claimed CEO Joseph Cuschieri.Blockchain analytics companies , proliferated bear market , come public scrutiny late stated goal deanonymizing blockchain transactions privacy implications presents . One company , Chainalysis , made public statement privacy policies early March try pre-empt criticisms.Malta sits interesting crossroads particular issue result . Attempting position blockchain hub quite time , government passed laws attract crypto businesses , met degree success . With moves , however , risk financial crimes increased . As , Times Malta reported timeline Malta ’ approval crypto licenses “ [ depends ] due diligence assessment — including competence field anti-money laundering counter funding terrorism. ” CipherTrace , seems , latest several blockchain companies earn Maltese government ’ confidence . Using tools , MFSA could keep tabs number financial crimes.On March 9–10 , 2019 , Massachusetts Institute Technology hosted two-day event , MIT Bitcoin Expo 2019 . Put together student-organized MIT Bitcoin Club , conference welcomed Bitcoin voices every corner industry . One voices U.S. Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) Commissioner Hester Peirce.Peirce sat Gary Gensler , ex-chairman Commodity Futures Trading Commission , senior lecturer MIT Sloan School Management senior advisor director MIT Media Lab , discuss progress SEC ’ efforts regulate cryptocurrency industry . Notably , Gensler Peirce launched discussion regulators better protect investors fraud malicious actors.Before debate began , Gensler Peirce expressed appreciation emerging technology . “ It ’ new way tamper resistant data amongst consensus multiple parties , ” Gensler said . “ My research mostly around business blockchain technology … trying find real use cases traditional data structures ’ work well. ” Peirce expressed support space relation SEC ’ ongoing efforts properly regulate . “ We rules books enforce , hand , ’ want stop people things going make society better place live , going make people ’ lives easier , enable people interact ways able past. ” Later presentation , two veteran regulators went discuss government protect investors possibly regulatinged cryptocurrency exchanges.Gensler believes “ exchanges gateway get good public policy , particularly around AML laws , also around investor protection. ” He continued , “ In essence , ’ manipulated market frontrunning manipulation order books like. ” The discourse ongoing , significant takeaway regulators like Peirce SEC acknowledge , , perhaps current system rules ’ apply perfectly . How could securities-based regulations placed cryptocurrencies , even officially defined securities ? The SEC , according Peirce , working may alternative set rules exchanges violate rules listing unregistered securities . Bitcoin , security , falls neatly alternative rule set . And , though currently unclear exact precedents , Peirce ’ thoughts around subject MIT ’ latest Bitcoin Expo nothing short encouraging Bitcoin ’ regulatory future. “ People regulate interactions one another , ’ sort whole purpose Bitcoin idea … would community would able regulate . So problems arise , people community thinking deal problems. “ I think markets could regulate lived world allowed , ” Peirce added.Peirce made similar remarks SEC ’ awareness Bitcoin community ’ tendency self-regulate past.Gensler Peirce also discussed topic initial coin offerings ( ICOs ) done provide clarity people participating once-booming phase . Peirce went explain SEC already provided clarity investors want create company , raise funds investors distribute returns based company ’ performance . For individuals , existing securities rules apply tokens.There , however , countless number tokens claim used utility network belong , originate ICO accept funds investors exchange tokens . There still plethora unanswered questions around these. “ That ’ need better job , ” Peirce said , “ providing guidance change one thing another. ” Eventually , said , SEC wants remove big gray cloud hanging project ’ heads.Overall , uplifting theme entire discussion could summarized exchange Peirce member audience , addressing current system discourages equal opportunity retail participation.The audience member asked , “ It may hubristic , many us independently wealthy still believe make good investment decisions , right ’ excluded participating . How move accredited investor laws away wealth thresholds toward something ’ far reasonable accessible mainstream investors ? ” “ Our accredited investors rules … I personally think rules consistent country , ” Peirce admitted , “ people taking opportunities , taking talents intelligence applying make lives better . We ’ put artificial barrier place people ’ that. ” As far whether opinions translate legislature , time tell . The entire MIT Bitcoin Expo 2019 livestream recording viewed here.An Israeli court ruled March 17 , 2019 , banks ca n't enforce blanket ban accounts linked cryptocurrency . Instead , court said , banks need consider specific type scope crypto-related activity determining whether open account.The case involved lawsuit begun May 2018 Israminers , bitcoin mining company based Ukraine , Union Bank Israel . The bank refused accept deposits company 's account , ultimately shut account much money account related bitcoin.The bank 's position allowing crypto-related activity within accounts managed put risk facilitating money laundering . As result , decided early 2014 refuse provide services related virtual currencies.The bank argued court notified Supervisor Banks , Israeli government agency oversees banking industry , policy told would pose problem.However , March 17 , 2019 , ruling , judge Limor Bibi wrote bank 's policy broad , according Israeli newspaper Calcalist . It `` unreasonable , '' wrote , banks adopt `` sweeping policy '' ban activity related bitcoin cryptocurrency.That said , Bibi also wrote banks within rights refuse provide services customers operating crypto economy bank legitimate reason believe customers might seeking launder money.In short , , court upheld right banks refuse provide services crypto-related activities might violate law . But banks ca n't ban deposits accounts simply involve crypto.Broadly speaking , ruling aligns recommendations released earlier month Israel 's financial regulator regarding crypto economy . The report encourages government support crypto companies emphasizing importance disclosures oversight crypto activity.As anxiety grows around every new twist turn ongoing QuadrigaCX drama , along extensive QuadrigaCX media coverage , Canada ’ mainstream media calling government bring better oversight regulation cryptocurrency businesses , especially cryptocurrency exchanges.In response calls regulation calls crypto businesses regulatory clarity , Canadian Securities Administrators ( CSA ) Investment Industry Regulatory Organization Canada ( IIROC ) released discussion paper March 14 , 2019 , “ New Proposed Platform Framework ” would aim specifically tailor regulations special risks posed cryptocurrency exchanges.The CSA consultation paper , viewed , asks 22 questions requests comments crypto/fintech companies , market participants/investors crypto stakeholders regulations would best fit unique new cryptocurrency marketplace.When Is Crypto Exchange Securities Derivatives Dealer ? As number observers commented , round consultations mainly define new business cryptocurrency exchanges far go imposing old regulatory models new economic system.Calgary-based securities cryptocurrency lawyer Matt Burgoyne commented Twitter : “ There lot unpack new CSA consultation paper cryptocurrency exchanges . Exchanges must consider whether interactions users create derivative contract futures contract. ” He added , “ Non-security tokens trading Canadian exchanges may derivatives still subject regulation … really detailed set consultation questions , comments industry due May 15. ” Lawyer Evan Thomas , headed legal team Osler , Hoskin & Harcourt LLP produce summary CSA consultation paper , told Bitcoin Magazine : “ A big issue proposal clear legal matter Canadian securities regulators jurisdiction regulate platforms trading bitcoin crypto-assets securities. ” One goals stated Osler paper : “ To ensure CSA exceed jurisdiction cryptoasset industry , hopeful Platform regulation provide clarity regarding types cryptoassets related services subject securities regulation , tokens investment contracts derivatives non-custodial cryptocurrency wallets. ” Third Time Lucky ? The Canadian government conducted two previous consultation rounds cryptocurrency industry ( 2014 2018 ) Thomas , cautiously optimistic , notes new initiative direct response cases like QuadrigaCX. “ Earlier regulation directed combating money laundering terrorist financing . This proposed framework motivated investor protection concerns ; , trying protect crypto users use custodial exchanges risks like hacking , embezzlement market manipulation , ” Thomas explained.The ghost QuadrigaCX seen current discussion paper asks : What operational requirements put place prevent collapse like QuadrigaCX ? What measures affect market integrity , fair pricing , disclosure conflict interest business continuity planning ? Would Proposed Regulations Have Prevented QuadrigaCX Collapse ? It ’ interesting question whether proposed regulations discussion paper would prevented happened QuadrigaCX — answer likely no.Amber D. Scott , CEO Outlier Canada , cryptocurrency compliance consulting company , told Bitcoin Magazine without adequate enforcement resources , ’ unlikely new rules would affected outcome. “ Background checks beneficial owners executives useful sufficiently in-depth acted upon . The QuadrigaCX story interesting registered FINTRAC ( Financial Transactions Reports Analysis Centre Canada ) one point ( though 's clear whether front application beneficial owners ) . “ Similarly , proposed audits useful tools , I expect fooling auditors would possible , especially given experienced auditors also understand crypto assets stage. ” She added , many cases , impact likely greater cost compliance burden companies choose operate within frameworks , little . “ In estimation , important ( lacking ) resources needed investigate prosecute bad actors . Fraud already illegal. ” Clear Regulations Are Good Crypto BusinessDespite , number Canadian crypto exchanges , including Coinsquare Coinberry , said would welcome clear , fair regulations make easier compliant help bring financial mainstream.The Osler paper highlights positive benefits regulation including better relationships banking sector : “ By establishing regulatory regime Platforms , Framework may make easier Platforms obtain maintain commercial relationships banks financial institutions , remains ongoing challenge certain Platforms. ” In addition , clear regulations apply crypto asset securities dealers would opening businesses currently flying radar. “ The Framework potentially opens door Platforms transact cryptoassets securities derivatives operate within Canada compliant manner . Examples may include Platforms dealing security tokens tokenized assets , decentralized prediction markets so-called ‘ decentralized finance ’ ( DeFi ) activities. ” The proposed regulations apply crypto platforms located Canada , well foreign platforms Canadian participants , might eligible exemptions appropriately regulated home jurisdiction.The CSA federal government agency coordinating financial regulations Canadian capital markets IIROC industry ’ self-regulatory organization oversees investment dealers Canada ’ debt equity markets.Japanese regulators reportedly approved draft amendments country 's financial instruments payment services laws , introducing stricter regulations margin trading digital assets.A report local news publication Nikkei Asia Review noted amendments place cap available leverage crypto margin trading , pegging two four times initial deposit.The report , published yesterday , also claimed cryptocurrency exchanges offer margin trading register Japan ’ Financial Services Agency ( FSA ) within 18 months new rules implemented April 2020.Clamping Down Margin TradingMargin trading use borrowed funds ( often obtained financial broker exchange ) trade financial asset . The funds borrowed become collateral loan , upon interest paid.The practice margin trading cryptocurrencies become popular recent years thanks potential significant returns . Platforms BitMEX offered massive leverage margin trading , increasing appeal investors globally . But potential high yield investments also come downsides , including temptation make large , risky investments borrowed funds.Protecting Consumers Growing MarketAccording report , new rules allow Japan closely monitor exchanges concerted effort better protect consumers . Exchanges offer margin trading issue tokens Initial Coin Offerings ( ICOs ) would separated regulated differently , instance . The hope categorization enable FSA clamp scam investment opportunities , also providing healthy environment crypto industry continue growth.For time , Japan ’ reputation crypto growing , thanks seemingly progressive stance digital currencies.In October 2018 , FSA approved Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association ( JVCEA ) , self-regulatory body consists 16 licensed crypto exchange platforms country .

      "Roughly nine months ago, Bitcoin Foundation Chief Scientist Gavin Andresen made a rather interesting comment on Reddit in which he claimed, “I suspect many [cloud mining companies] will turn out to be Ponzi schemes.”There have been a few cloud mining scams uncovered over the past year or two, and it appears that another one could unravel in the near future. An anonymous source has provided information to Bitcoin Magazine regarding the possibility of a Bitcoin cloud mining ponzi scheme involving Bitcoin Cloud Services (BCS), which is currently one of the largest cloud-mining providers on the market. One of the common attributes of a Ponzi scheme in the Bitcoin world is a reliance on anonymous owners. BTC Cloud Services LTD is registered to Gabriel Kleiman and Esteban Amador Soto Martinez.While the first name does not bring up any identifying information online, the second name is associated with another bitcoin-related scam, bitcoincloudhashing.com. This information is available publicly on the bitcointalk forums thanks to Puppet’s Cloudmining 101 thread, but it hasn't stopped an estimated 4,300 users from signing up at Bitcoin Cloud Services. BCS also claims to be a silver member of the Bitcoin Foundation on their website, even though the foundation recently dropped the cloud mining company as a sponsor.Further, the pictures of a supposed mining facility on the Bitcoin Cloud Services website contain no information about the mining facility or its owners besides a single banner hanging in the background. Compare to the photo below from Genesis Mining showing CEO Marco Streng in one of the company's mining farms. The “company” also released a poorly made video based off the Photoshopped images in an effort to bring more legitimacy to their activities:The supporting evidence on the blockchainOne of the key pieces of data provided by the anonymous source is a spreadsheet compiled via publicly available data on the Bitcoin blockchain but we do not know the specific bitcoin mining software used. By watching Bitcoin Cloud Services’ payout address, the anonymous source was able to estimate the number of customers receiving payouts, along with BCS’s profits and losses. BCS seems to have started to operate at a loss near the end of April. How did BCS respond? By offering an extra year on their currently available mining contracts. Typical behavior of a Bitcoin cloud mining ponzi scheme.This offer could be an attempt to keep a Ponzi scheme going for as long as possible. After all, it will last only as long as new money is coming in. The back-of-the-envelope math based on the spreadsheet indicates that the operators could run off with as much as 2,500 BTC ($570,000 at current prices) with a bitcoin mining scam.If it looks like a duck...Going back to Puppet’s Cloud Mining 101 thread, it seems clear that he understands the likelihood that BCS is a Ponzi scheme. The thread lists seven different criteria that are usually found in a Ponzi scheme, and BCS fits the bill in six out of seven criteria. The only test that BCS seems to have passed is having pictures of their mining facility on their website. Of course, as Puppet notes in his thread, “Pictures can be faked.” This seems to be what has happened in the case of Bitcoin Cloud Services. Puppet currently has BCS listed under “Likely Ponzi scams that have yet to collapse,” and it’s unclear how long BCS will be able to keep up the charade. Up to this point, Puppet has been correct with 95 percent of his calls of a probable Bitcoin cloud mining ponzi scheme. Bitcoin Magazine has reached out to BCS for comment.In March of 2015, two federal agents who helped conduct one of the major investigations in the Silk Road case allegedly stole thousands in bitcoin confiscated from the online dark marketplace. The two agents, Shaun Bridges and Carl Force from the Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Secret Service, were charged with several offenses including wire fraud and money laundering.This week, Bridges, a special agent for the U.S. Secret Service for the Silk Road case, has come to an agreement with the prosecutors and pleaded guilty for the theft of confiscated bitcoin from Silk Road.Bridges took part in a Baltimore task force as a computer forensics expert where he contributed to an investigation which acquired enough evidence to accuse Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road for allegedly hiring assassins to murder six individuals that threatened the marketplace.During the operation, Bridges stole thousands in bitcoin by obtaining the passwords to Silk Road from the marketplace’s customer support representative and moved the bitcoin to his own personal account.Specifically, the prosecutors claimed that the stolen bitcoin were transferred into Japanese bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, to convert the bitcoin into U.S. dollars and then move it to his bank account.The bitcoin stolen by Bridges are said to be worth around $820,000, which is equivalent to around 3,565 bitcoin, at today’s bitcoin price.Bridges Pleads Guilty to TheftThis week, in a filing at the San Francisco federal court, Bridges agreed to plead guilty for the theft of bitcoin that once belonged to Silk Road and to two other charges: money laundering and obstruction of justice.“Mr. Bridges has regretted his actions from the very beginning,\" Bridges’ lawyer, Steve Hale Levin said. \"His decision to plead guilty reflects his complete acceptance of responsibility and is another step towards rehabilitation.”Back in March, however, Bridges and Levin strongly denied the accusations.“Mr. Bridges, a former law enforcement officer with an unblemished record, maintains his innocence. He will fight the charges in the appropriate place at the appropriate time,” Levin said at the time.The hearing date of the other agent behind the theft of bitcoin from Silk Road has been rescheduled to August, around the same time Bridges is required to submit a plea.In a February 17 letter, Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center President & CEO Allen Stefanek said, “…the amount of Bitcoins requested was 40 Bitcoins, equivalent to approximately $17,000.” This is the number of bitcoins that the HPMC transferred to a hacker or hackers in exchange for the decryption key to the malware locking them out of their IT systems. The hospital’s network was under attack for 11 days (February 5-15 ) before Stefanek paid the ransom. While headlines jested about a hospital staff reverting back to pre-1990s procedures when paper and pen were the data medium of the day, a technological regression on this order, when lives are at stake, required a calculation. Stefanek and the hospital had to decide whether people’s lives were worth 40 bitcoins. Ultimately, HPMC calculated their losses and liability and paid. This type of Bitcoin-based ransomware has been on the rise since 2013 when it is estimated that more than 200 malware programs were being released every minute of that year. Initially, there was CryptoLocker, the ransomware that demanded about $300 in bitcoins from the personal computer user before wiping their hard drives. In early 2015, security companies McAfee and Symantec warned of the CTB-Locker (Curve Tor Bitcoin Locker). This elliptical curve encryption ransomware, spread through spam campaigns, locks users out of their files. Paying a Bitcoin ransom is the only way to retrieve the 3,072-bit key. As of January 2016, hackers have been deploying ransomware against websites to shake them down as well. Reports estimate that malware-as-service is now becoming one of the fastest growing trades on the darknet markets. The FBI assumes that there are around 200 hackers responsible for the current malware fiasco. As more attacks are launched against personal computer users, websites, and even hospitals, the numbers of Bitcoin related ransomware attacks that are paid will increase, with the HPMC serving as a example for other hackers.  The comparatively paltry sum of 40 bitcoins recently ransomed from HPMC represents a new iteration in the morphing nature of ransomware targets: soft targets that have excellent insurance and will be inoperable without access to their data. By asking for a reasonable sum, the hackers are forcing the victims to pay the ransom and write off the cost as an operation expense. Stefanek explains in the letter, “The quickest and most efficient way to restore our systems and administrative functions was to pay the ransom and obtain the decryption key.  In the best interest of restoring normal operations, we did this.” A move like this can create potential liabilities in the future for HPMC because targets that pay the ransom are often retargeted, but it was imperative that the hospital have its EMR (Electronic Medical Record) service operable. The simplest solution to the problem is that systems, sites and files should all be backed up in secure locations offline as a fail safe against attack. Such services exist, but individuals and organizations typically don't think to use them until an attack already has occurred. Some believe entities such as hospitals should be required by law to be more responsible with patient data. Similar security weaknesses were exposed following the hack of Target’s TGT security and payments system in 2013. After that hack, consumers became aware of how lackadaisical the retail giant had been with their customer’s data. Increased Bitcoin ransomware attacks could result in resiliency in the area of Bitcoin’s “untraceability” and of private data management systems. Although Bitcoin has a reputation as a haven for criminals who wish to transact online in an anonymous manner, it doesn’t appear the currently available wallet options are very helpful for this potential use case of the digital cash system. In their second edition of the Bitcoin Wallet Privacy Rating Report, released Sunday, the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project (OBPP) has painted a rather dismal picture of privacy in Bitcoin wallets.The OBPP report says that many privacy-focused initiatives for Bitcoin “stalled out” in 2015. In the introduction to the report, OBPP contributor Kristov Atlas writes, “Improvements are desperately needed to keep Bitcoin independent and safe.”Ledger Takes the Top SpotAlthough Ledger can rejoice in the fact that it has created the most private Bitcoin wallet on the market, the fact that it scored only 50 out of 100 possible points should give every Bitcoin user pause. Ledger has released a variety of hardware devices, which have been integrated into multiple third-party wallets, but the OBPP’s report focused on the Ledger Nano and the company’s own wallet solution.In the report, it is noted that Ledger’s Chrome extension-based Bitcoin wallet does not contain advanced privacy features. In fact, it doesn’t even store a local copy of the blockchain. Ledger’s positive marks appear to have come from its ability to assist users in avoiding address reuse and managing multiple accounts within the same wallet.Coinbase Places Last AgainCoinbase is the service that placed last in the OBPP’s original review of Bitcoin wallets in the spring of last year, and the a16z-backed company has taken the bottom spot again in 2016. Of course, it should be noted that Coinbase offers a variety of services that make it difficult for them to provide high-levels of privacy to its users. In fact, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong recently wrote a Medium post titled \"Coinbase is not a wallet\" about how the company is more of a retail exchange than a wallet provider.In the OBPP’s report, the custodial nature of Coinbase’s consumer wallet is pointed out as a major flaw. Although Coinbase is required to follow Know-Your-Customer (KYC) guidelines because it also handles fiat money, the report claims some privacy improvements, such as discouraging address reuse, can be made without disrupting the company’s KYC responsibilities.Coinbase is able to offer mainstream users unique features, such as USD balances, which make it easier for some individuals to interact with Bitcoin as a payment system. Some will say it doesn’t make sense to include Coinbase, which is essentially a Bitcoin bank, in a report about wallets, but it’s important for users to be aware of the privacy-related consequences of using this type of custodial wallet.Is Privacy in Bitcoin Dead?This report from the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project will definitely be an eye-opener for individuals who believe they can use Bitcoin privately with a variety of wallets. Perhaps the most troubling aspect of the report is that the world’s two most popular Bitcoin wallets, Blockchain and Coinbase, both scored in the bottom four of all wallet providers.One of the only bright spots of the report is Samourai, which is ranked sixth in Bitcoin wallet privacy. The report notes a number of promised features that will eventually be integrated into the relatively new wallet option and adds, “The wallet is off to a strong start in 2015, and threatens to usurp Darkwallet for the spotlight in 2016 as the defacto choice for privacy-minded users.”Andrew Poelstra is a mathematician at Blockstream and was recently part of a panel discussion on improvements for Bitcoin at the 2016 MIT Bitcoin Expo. During the panel, Poelstra discussed Confidential Transactions, which is a privacy-enhancing feature he has been working on with Blockstream co-founders and Bitcoin Core contributors Greg Maxwell and Pieter Wuille.One of the main reasons Blockstream is working on Confidential Transactions is to preserve the censorship-resistant properties of Bitcoin and other blockchains.Scalability Is Not the Only Problem with BitcoinAlthough scalability solutions have been a major area of contention lately, Poelstra understands this is not the only real problem. During his recent appearance at the MIT Bitcoin Expo, Poelstra pointed out the issues related to the public nature of Bitcoin transactions:“Lately, we’ve been talking about scaling and centralization, but that’s not the only problem with Bitcoin. This one may be a bit attractable, which is that all transactions are public and all of the information in all the transactions are public. This allows a lot of analysis to happen . . . [People] can infer a lot about transactions just from the amounts and also the shape of the transactions.”Indeed, there are a number of different startups working to deanonymize the Bitcoin blockchain every day. In the past, Stash co-founder and Open Transactions creator Chris Odom has stated these companies could go out of business as more privacy-enhancing features are enabled on the blockchain.Centralization of Mining Threatens Censorship ResistanceAt the core of Bitcoin’s value proposition is censorship resistance. Bitcoin has value because it can be used to complete transactions that are likely to be censored on other payment networks. Andrew Poelstra is committed to preserving this aspect of the technology.The centralization of mining is one of the current weak points in Bitcoin due to the attack vector opened up when the people who are processing transactions can possibly identify transactions they or regulators don’t like. Poelstra hit on this point during the panel discussion at the MIT Bitcoin Expo:“One reason we’re worried about the centralization of mining is that miners are, sort of, gatekeepers to what transactions can go in the blockchain and what can’t.”This desire to weaken the negative effects of Bitcoin mining centralization is what pushes Poelstra and others to work on Confidential Transactions. With Confidential Transactions, privacy is improved by cryptographically masking the amounts associated with Bitcoin transactions. When this privacy-enhancing feature is used, onlookers are unlikely to be able to figure out which addresses are change addresses, which means it’s difficult to tell which Bitcoin address is receiving a payment.Confidential Transactions Can HelpCoinJoin, originally proposed by Greg Maxwell, has been around since 2013, but there are still some major issues with the privacy-focused tool. Poelstra mentioned how Confidential Transactions can improve CoinJoin during the panel discussion:“It’s very difficult to do a CoinJoin in a way that improves privacy, and it’s also very difficult to measure how much privacy we get. By hiding amounts, we allow combining transactions in a way that we no longer have this clear correlation. [With Confidential Transactions], I have a couple of outputs, Mark has a couple of outputs, and nobody can see the amounts. When we put them together, now it’s just a pile of outputs with no one else associated.”Keeping scalability in mind, Blockstream has been focused on making Confidential Transactions as efficient as possible. When Confidential Transactions is combined with CoinJoin, it becomes much more difficult to censor transactions as a miner because there is more difficulty associated with identifying the individuals behind specific transactions.Many people in the Bitcoin community see OpenBazaar as the next iteration of darknet marketplaces, but the first version of this network will not be suitable for those attempting to sell goods or services in an anonymous manner. During a recent guest appearance at the Coinscrum Members Club, OB1 CEO and OpenBazaar project lead Brian Hoffman discussed anonymity on the OpenBazaar network, and he noted that these features have been deferred to a future section of the development roadmap.At one point during the Q&A session, Hoffman stated, “Right now, it’s fairly obvious, based on your connection information, where you are or where you’re running it from and things like that.”Privacy and Anonymity Are Key Features for OpenBazaarAlthough OpenBazaar will not offer anonymity to its users by default in its first full release, the team behind the project view this feature as a fundamental aspect of the protocol. During his recent appearance at the Coinscrum Members Club, Hoffman said, “I think [anonymity] is, without a doubt, one of the most important, fundamental things that we need to have in OpenBazaar.”Hoffman added:“If you hear anybody say that we don’t care about that, it’s patently false. We definitely do. It just becomes a matter of how you do that gracefully without scaring off any other clearnet type users.”Hoffman also noted that a roadmap for incorporating more anonymity into OpenBazaar has been developed.Growing OpenBazaar on the ClearnetThe plan to avoid anonymity for now should not be viewed as a dismissal of the need for this type of functionality. Instead, the deferment of these features to a later date is part of a grander vision. Hoffman described the OpenBazaar developers’ perspective on anonymity during his recent Coinscrum Members Club appearance by asking a question:“What is the best way to bootstrap a decentralized, private marketplace without basically inviting all of the darknet marketplaces to just shift their stock onto this and scare the crap out of any potential normal user from joining OpenBazaar?”Hoffman then explained that deferment of anonymity for users would be the best strategy to help the network attract more buyers and sellers over the long term:“We’ve basically deferred it to a little bit later in the development process. This, we hope, will give us time to establish a baseline of nodes on the network and liquidity of items without overwhelming it with just darknet items.”While it’s possible that portions of the OpenBazaar network could become the new, decentralized hub of darknet commerce, the developers behind the project also want to see the general public use the platform for legal commerce.Technical Reasons for DefermentIn addition to the strategic reasons for temporarily avoiding anonymity, the OpenBazaar team is also currently avoiding Tor integration for technical reasons. Hoffman explained:“One of the reasons we’ve also deferred it technically is that we’re using a UDP network. If you’re not familiar with that, it’s not compatible with Tor, which is kind of the primary [anonymizing network].”Hoffman said the team is also looking at i2p as a possible option for anonymizing users. He added that some of the i2p developers are already starting to collaborate with the OpenBazaar team.ProtonMail, the world’s largest encrypted email provider, announced that the service is leaving beta and will be allowing open registrations. ProtonMail is also launching its free iOS and Android mobile applications globally in the Apple App store and Google Play store.ProtonMail  features end-to-end encryption, which makes it practically impossible for governments, or even ProtonMail itself, to gain access to user messages, ensuring the highest level of security and privacy. The service encrypts and decrypts all data on-the-fly on the client side, which means that emails between ProtonMail users are never stored as plaintext, and therefore the government can’t force their release.“Strong encryption and privacy are a social and economic necessity. Not only does this technology protect activists and dissidents, it is also key to securing the world’s digital infrastructure,” says ProtonMail co-founder Andy Yen. “This is why, all things considered, strong encryption is absolutely necessary for the greater good.”The development of ProtonMail started in 2014 at CERN ‒ just like the development of the Web itself ‒ in response to growing concerns about governments spying on peaceful citizens’ email. “I am very concerned about the privacy issue, and I was wondering what I could do about it,” Yen posted to a CERN Facebook group. ProtonMail raised its first $550,000 with crowdfunding, followed by a $2 million seed round from Charles River Ventures and Fongit. Today, ProtonMail is one of the fastest-growing companies in Switzerland with three offices globally, and was ranked last year by Business Insider as the hottest startup in Switzerland.The decision to open up ProtonMail is motivated by an increasing trend toward more and more surveillance around the world and growing efforts to undermine online privacy. “We understand that governments have concerns when it comes to terrorism and encryption, but undermining our collective security by weakening cryptography is the wrong approach,” notes the announcement.“The best way to ensure that encryption and privacy rights are not encroached upon is to get the tools into the hands of the public as soon as possible and widely distributing them,” added Yen. “This way, we put the choice in the hands of the consumer, and not government regulators. The past decade has been marked by a massive erosion of privacy and we’re working to reverse this trend. Encrypted communications is the future and ProtonMail is committed to making online privacy a reality again for all Internet users.”Anyone can open a ProtonMail account without releasing personal information. Interestingly, the sign-up procedure ‒ like ProtonMail itself ‒ works well over Tor. “Creating your free secure email account takes less than 2 minutes in most cases,” notes the ProtonMail signup page. The free service includes 500 megabytes of storage, and paid services have been launched recently. The cheapest premium plan, at $5 per month ($4 per month if paid annually), includes 5 gigabytes of storage and a custom domain. Current payment options are credit cards, PayPal and Bitcoin.The Bitcoin payment option complements the anonymity of the signup process and the possibility to sign up and use ProtonMail over Tor. Taken together, these features mean that anonymous users can have premium ProtonMail accounts.ProtonMail is a Swiss company with servers located in secure data centers in Switzerland, and is protected by privacy-friendly Swiss laws. In 2015, Bitcoin company Xapo relocated its corporate headquarters to Zurich to take advantage of the same privacy-friendly laws. Xapo’s primary deep cold storage vault was already located in Switzerland.This is one of many parallels between ProtonMail and Bitcoin. ProtonMail wants to put privacy back into the Internet, which is increasingly controlled by governments and corporations as shown by the current dispute between Apple and the FBI over encrypted communications. Bitcoin, which in theory permits private payments on the Internet, is also increasingly controlled by governments and corporations in ways that can void privacy. However, there are initiatives such as Zcash that promise to put private payments back into the Internet.\"ProtonMail and Bitcoin actually have a long history together,” Yen told Bitcoin Magazine. “Back in 2014 when PayPal instituted a payment block against us, we relied on BTC donations to keep the service running.\"\"We view the Apple case as very troubling, and unfortunately, Apple is likely to lose this one in the court of opinion since the FBI picked their case very carefully,” added Yen. “However, Apple is not Lavabit [an encrypted webmail service, used by Edward Snowden, which was shut down by the US government], and if the world's largest tech company is standing on the side of privacy, the entire movement just gained a very powerful ally.\"Bitcoin was embraced by many for its libertarian ideals of economic liberty and individual sovereignty. But it has now effectively been dragged into the current, and very public, privacy debate between Apple and the FBI.Last week, President Barack Obama said he believes a balance must be sought between privacy and security. As one example of the risks of strong encryption, and seemingly referring to cryptocurrencies, Obama pointed out that if government can't access phones, “everybody is walking around with a Swiss bank account in their pocket.”To find out where Bitcoin's industry representatives stand on this issue, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Bitcoin Foundation director Bruce Fenton Coin Center director of research Peter Van Valkenburgh, and senior fellow at the libertarian think tank Cato institute and former Bitcoin Foundation board member Jim Harper.Encryption and Law EnforcementThe current debate on encryption started when recent acts of terrorism in San Bernardino, California brought about a highly publicized showdown between Apple and the FBI.After a San Bernardino couple, Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people, the FBI found Farook’s iPhone 5C was locked with a password and data encrypted. The action of the FBI to seek the decryption from the terrorist Farook’s iPhone brought Apple into the California district court of Judge Sheri Pym, who ruled Apple should offer “reasonable technical assistance” to law enforcement, and must provide a tool that would allow federal agents to beat a security feature that prevents the phone from erasing after some failed unlocking attempts.Apple CEO Tim Cook, however, worries that creating a patch to enable entry through a back door threatens the ability to maintain privacy for its hundreds of millions of customers worldwide.This sentiment was echoed by Bitcoin industry representatives.Bitcoin Foundation director Bruce Fenton – who also organizes the industry's Satoshi Roundtable – took over as director of the foundation last year.Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, he stated:“There are those who believe privacy is a right and there are those who believe that it is not. I don't support efforts to erode privacy under claims of defense from imaginary threats.”Jim Harper, who at Cato works to adapt law and policy to the information age, wholeheartedly agreed.“Weakening encryption for terrorism investigations, money laundering prevention and tax collection would cost more in lost security for everyone than it would benefit us through greater security, crime control and fattened government coffers,” Harper said. “I've personally been working for several years to strengthen Fourth Amendment doctrine in the Supreme Court. My work may help courts recognize that conscripting Apple into writing code that breaks its security is a Fourth Amendment seizure of Apple's resources, and an unreasonable one.”Implications for BitcoinSeveral Bitcoin wallet apps currently offer “zero knowledge security” which ensures user data by generating private keys completely client side.But what happens if Pandora’s Box is opened? What if encryption is weakened or even broken by state agencies?Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, sees trying to break the encryption protecting one phone as having “extremely damaging implications” for the rights of many millions of people worldwide, with possible effects on their physical and financial security.Obama, meanwhile, seemed to suggest that this kind of financial security should in fact not be absolute. He believes a balance must be struck, suggesting encryption should be weakened to allow government agencies access to encrypted phones in certain cases.Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center, doubts any technical trade-offs are possible at all.“You can't weaken encryption,” he explained. “You can only weaken the ability of American companies to compete in the development of secure technologies, and the ability of law-abiding American citizens to have secure tools. If Americans don't build and maintain these tools, then people in other countries or in the underground economy will. Outlawing the use or development of these tools will only hasten the demise of our legitimate institutions as they would continually fail to compete with international or extralegal institutions that are not hobbled by impractical restrictions.”But what if it is indeed technically possible to completely shut state agencies out of phones? Should that be considered a problem? Should we as a society be concerned about citizens walking around with Swiss bank accounts in their pockets, as Obama suggested?Fenton doesn't believe so.“My first reaction to the president's statement was: 'So what?' Why should the federal government care if people have a bank account in their pocket? That is a technological achievement, and, in itself, is nothing close to a crime that government should be concerned with,\" Fenton said.He added:“It is concerning when politicians reach far from concerns about crimes that have actual victims to areas which are more about restricting freedom than protecting citizens. I think we do need to worry about the trend of government officials who push the idea that citizens having privacy and control of their own money is somehow a bad thing. It's only in recent years, with the proliferation of credit cards and online banking, that government has become so presumptive about their rights to our privacy. I think this is much more dangerous than whatever drawbacks that privacy may have.”Tax ImplicationsThe main reason Obama used the Swiss bank analogy is probably tax evasion. Using Bitcoin, it becomes increasingly easy for users to hide vast amounts of wealth, which enables citizens to avoid certain forms of tax evasion.Industry representatives actually shared this concern – or at least believe the concern is valid.Though, according to Fenton:“The tail should not wag the dog regarding taxes and Bitcoin. Commerce, innovation and jobs come first. The IRS for decades had to deal with cash-based economies where it was very difficult to track real income and revenue. They should adjust and do whatever they need to do to adapt to new technology; we should not delay or impede innovation for concern that the IRS may have a harder job.“Harper believes potential tax evasion issues will eventually call for alternative solutions.“In decades or perhaps even a century, Bitcoin or successor currencies and transaction mechanisms may narrow the field of taxable transactions,” he said. “Fully digital transactions will be too fluid to catch or may lack a recognizable physical jurisdiction. This will push tax collection toward physical things like housing, durable goods, and disposable goods. It's all a long way off, though, I'll emphasize.”Money LaunderingAnother problem often brought up regarding Bitcoin is money laundering. Increased anonymity and the inability of law enforcement to block or regulate the flow of funds enables criminals to use Bitcoin for nefarious purposes.Fenton:“People like New York State's former Superintendent of Financial Services Ben Lawsky, who's responsible for the BitLicense, seem to take it as a given and indisputable fact that money laundering is a horrible crime. I challenge that notion. In most cases of money laundering there is no clear victim, no person or people who were actually harmed. Opportunists make the leap of saying that things like terrorism will be more prevalent because of money laundering, but this is hogwash. Terrorism is more of a risk because of things like bad foreign policy than money laundering. Could technologies like Bitcoin make life easier for criminals? Of course. Just as shoes, the Internet and mobile phones do. New technologies make things easier for everyone. Regulators and thief supporters would be better off spending time focusing on violators of the law than on technologies.”Harper agreed:“I don't worry about degrading governments' power to curtail money laundering because it is a regulatory crime, not a genuine wrong. Money laundering controls probably cost more in compliance expense and curtailed trade (especially internationally) than they provide in security, crime control and quality-of-life benefits. We're worse off as a society because of money laundering laws and the financial surveillance that supports them.”As such, the question is what the Bitcoin community can do to protect itself against potential weakening of encryption or breaches of security. Should Bitcoin companies and users accept certain trade-offs, or should they move to protect themselves?Harper prefers the latter.“Our best defense is going to be shifting to open source, non-proprietary communications and transaction tools. Such tools don't have a head office that can be bought off, bullied, or required by law to render themselves insecure. It's going to be hard to make that shift, but there's no time like the present to get started,” he said.        Zcash, which is an implementation of the zerocash concept, is often referred to as the first form of truly anonymous digital cash. While Bitcoin been called a haven for criminals by many misinformed individuals, the reality is Satoshi Nakamoto’s creation is a mostly-transparent ledger.Although Zcash enables the highest level of privacy currently allowed by cryptography, there are still some potential issues (mostly unrelated to privacy) for the financial-anonymity protocol to overcome. Zcash CEO Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn recently discussed some of these issues on Epicenter Bitcoin.Privacy Preserving Spends Take a Minute or Two to GenerateThe main issue with Zcash right now is that generating a new privacy-preserving spend is somewhat inefficient. Zooko, as he is commonly known, explained this issue during his recent Epicenter Bitcoin appearance:“The current alpha code that we have running on a testnet ‒ it takes like about a minute or two of CPU time to generate a new privacy-preserving spend and only like a few milliseconds, I think, to verify. The latter part is for the good for performance, and that’s really important because all the full nodes and the miners have to be doing verifications all the time. The former part is pretty bad because it takes a whole minute or two on like a high-powered, supercomputer 64-bit laptop CPU.”Zooko also added that privacy-preserving spend generation likely requires more than 4 gigabytes of RAM, although he also mentioned that they don’t have precise measurements on RAM requirements quite yet.In regard to the consequences of the current system requirements involved with privacy-preserving spends, Zooko stated:“That is totally prohibitive for certain use cases like generating a new spend on your smartphone, for starters. Also, anything that’s got a real low-latency requirement where you get incoming money you receive and then like a millisecond later you need to spend that money to someone else right away ‒ that’s totally impossible with the current protocol.”With the current version of Zcash, there are definitely efficiency and usability tradeoffs. Having said that, this system is also intended to give users the highest level of financial anonymity and privacy.Getting Around Zcash’s Efficiency IssuesAlthough Zcash’s privacy-preserving transactions are somewhat inefficient, the digital currency’s users also have the ability to make traditional, transparent transactions, which are similar to Bitcoin transactions. Zooko explained that using a hybrid of privacy-preserving and transparent transactions on the Zcash blockchain can still offer many advantages over a traditional Bitcoin transaction. “The existence of the privacy-preserving transactions means that they break the links of the chain of transaction history,” the Zcash CEO noted.Zooko also explained how a combination of private and non-private transactions would work in greater detail:“There might be ways around it because if you have a buffer of money you can spend it using a privacy-preserving payment, so there’s no linkage between where it came to you. Then, you can privately spend it to a new address. So, there’s no linkage in the blockchain between where you got it and that new address that currently controls it. Then, you could do a non-private spend of it directly from that address.”Having said that, Zooko also stated this type of usage of the Zcash blockchain will not offer the greatest level of privacy for its users. He stated:“Earlier I said, ‘Zcash offers the maximum possible privacy that cryptography can provide.’ And that is true ‒ if all you ever do with it is the privacy-preserving spends. Then, you’re putting as little information as possible into the blockchain.”Missing Out on Some of Bitcoin’s FunctionalityIn addition to Zcash’s efficiency issues, the “HTTPS for money” also cannot enable many useful features of Bitcoin in its subset of privacy-preserving transactions. Zooko explained:“There’s a bunch of functionality in the Bitcoin ‒ or the globally transparent protocol ‒ that we can’t do with a privacy-preserving spend ‒ like multisignature transactions. Those are really important in Bitcoin. There’s a lot of really cool things being built with multisignature transactions.”He then clarified his point further:“Zcash can do multisignature transactions using the globally transparent subset of the protocol, but when you want to do a privacy-preserving spend, you can’t do multisignature.”Although there are still some issues with the Zcash protocol, it’s clear that the availability of a truly anonymous cash system is desired by the vast majority of the digital currency community. This sort of cryptographically-ensured privacy should become more usable over time. Perhaps the currently-available testnet version of Zcash should be viewed as an early preview of what’s to come in the future of privacy-conscious digital currencies.Bitcoin was seemingly dragged into the very public debate on privacy and encryption recently. Specifically, President Barack Obama  warned that if the government can't access phones, “...everybody is walking around with a Swiss bank account in their pocket,” which appeared to refer to cryptocurrency.Last week, Bitcoin Magazine  reported on Bitcoin's industry representatives and their positions on encryption, privacy, Bitcoin's role in tax evasion and money laundering and more. In part two of our coverage: What do the actual builders of these pocket-sized “Swiss bank accounts” think?Bitcoin Magazine reached out to  Electrum developer Thomas Voegtlin,  Breadwallet CEO Aaron Voisine,  Mycelium developer Leo Wandersleb and  Ledger CTO Nicolas Bacca to see where they stand.BrokenThe debate on encryption and privacy caused by the ongoing dispute between Apple and the FBI took a sharp turn this week. The United States Department of Justice had long claimed it was unable to access encrypted iPhones without help from Apple, but this turned out not to be true.Although the Department of Justice did not explain how they got access to the phone, the Bitcoin wallet developers Bitcoin Magazine spoke to were not surprised that they could.Ledger CTO Nicolas Bacca speculated: “To get access to the data, the FBI probably relied on some kind of physical attack involving the flash memory. Swapping the flash memory or disabling writes could get you infinite retries, so you can brute force the access code. The operating system doesn't handle that securely.”Bacca also pointed out that Bitcoin itself is much more secure than a typical iPhone.“I believe Bitcoin is less at risk against physical attacks compared to other cryptosystems, because you always get a way to invalidate a possibly compromised key - just send the coins to a different address if you notice quickly enough. The issue is properly qualifying how long is that.”BalanceWhile the FBI demands Apple help the government agency access encrypted iPhones, the tech company maintains that weakening encryption could result in a privacy disaster. Obama, explaining his position last week, argued it's important to find the right balance between privacy and security, suggesting weakened encryption should be an option.But this option was firmly rejected by all wallet developers Bitcoin Magazine spoke to.Electrum developer Thomas Voegtlin explained:“In the physical world, you can design a door that is difficult to break. This means that someone may be able to force that door, but not covertly, and that is why we have a balance between privacy and security. But computers are devices that tend to make things binary. In the world of computing, you either do have the key, and opening the door is very easy, or you don't, and it is impossible. If we give a special key to the government, they will be able to open millions of doors with that key, with no effort, and without attracting attention. Nothing will prevent someone from misusing that key, and eventually the key will be leaked and fall into the wrong hands. A technological backdoor is the modern equivalent of the  Ring of Gyges.”Ledger's Nicolas Bacca agreed.“As a society I believe we should be extremely worried about calls to weaken encryption,” Bacca said. “Practically, it cannot be done for a single target, as any 'NOBUS' backdoor turns into a global risk when it's discovered. Ideologically, we already had a clear demonstration that letting agencies run loose with that kind of absolute power was a pretty bad idea. Politically, I believe it can lead to important economic collateral damages, which is another good reason to avoid doing it.”Voisine agreed with this assesment as well. Moreover, the Breadwallet developer argued that strong encryption is itself a balancing factor against the widespread data monitoring, not a factor that itself requires balance.“Privacy is core to the human experience. Imagine if your landlord or your extended family knew exactly how much money you had at any given time, and how much you spent and when. It would be a disaster. Privacy is a leveler that allows parties with otherwise unequal bargaining power to negotiate on equal footing. It’s even required by law in many situations, such as with the finances of publicly traded firms. Intentionally weakened encryption is absolutely something that we should all be worrying about. In a future world with the potential for ubiquitous surveillance, strong encryption available to individuals will be the counterbalancing force,” Voisine said.TaxationPerhaps the main reason Obama cited the Swiss bank account example was to point out that strong encryption could allow citizens an easy escape from certain types of taxation. More specifically, Bitcoin users can potentially store significant amounts of wealth on their phones without government agencies knowing about it, or even being able to touch it.Mycelium developer Leo Wandersleb, however, questioned whether that should be considered a problem at all.Wandersleb:“So Obama is worried that government might not have ultimate power over its citizens' assets? Help me, why again does he assume the right to have that power? I'm not a U.S. citizen, so excuse me if I'm not too firm with regard to the Constitution and its amendments ... but I know of nothing that would say 'all property is yours unless the government doesn't agree.'”Electrum's Voegtlin took a slightly more moderate position.“I am not an anarchist, and my involvement with Bitcoin is not motivated by anti-government ideology. I believe in a society with government, with taxes and law enforcement. I write Bitcoin software because I believe that the benefits of cryptocurrency, for society and for our economies, far outweigh the risks. However, we should not be denying there are risks. New technologies always carry new risks.”But the answer to combating these risks is not to encroach on encryption, Voegtlin pointed out. Rather, he believes the risks should be mitigated through alternative means.Voegtlin:“I think that law enforcement and taxation will need to adapt to cryptocurrency. In 2011, Pirate Party founder Rick Falkvinge  proposed that, in a world with Bitcoin, governments should tax consumption, rather than wealth or income. I believe that level of thinking is appropriate.”Voisine, too, believes the answer will eventually be looked for in alternative methods of taxation.“There are many tax revenue streams that are difficult to avoid even with the leveling power of privacy putting the individual on a more equal footing with the state. Two examples are use taxes and property taxes. As the industry grows and the world moves their wealth into Bitcoin, I think we will see a gradual shift toward more heavy reliance on these types of income streams by the state. This has the added benefit of making the true cost of state services and programs more transparent. Privacy for individuals and transparency for the state is a wonderful thing.”SecurityPerhaps unsurprisingly, Bitcoin wallet developers have no intention of weakening the security or decreasing the privacy they offer. Rather, most intend to increase both the security and privacy of their products where possible.Mycelium currently uses a server-based model, which means governments could potentially pressure the wallet provider to give up certain privacy sensitive information or provide false transaction data to users.But Wandersleb explained the wallet intends to improve this:“We are working on removing ourselves from the equation. Our new wallet will not depend on our servers, so there will be no single point of failure. It will also be open source, so even if we were forced to weaken our product, others could choose to distribute reliable versions. Lastly, Mycelium works with hardware wallets that provide a very good protection against broken operating systems.”Bacca's Ledger is one of the companies working with Mycelium to realize this solution. Bacca explained:“We are building additional security layers directly on the phones when we can, and we're also building a new hardware wallet device, Ledger Blue. This provides open applications development on a Secure Element, which a phone can use over Bluetooth low-energy. That would be close to the hypothetical doomsday device referred to by Obama.”And Voisine, too, emphasized that privacy and security remain top priorities for Breadwallet.Voisine:“A Swiss bank in every pocket empowers the individual in incredible ways we've never seen before. It's time that this option becomes available to the whole world, not just the wealthy and politically connected, and we are going to give it to them.”Segregated Witness has entered its  final testing stage before roll-out on the Bitcoin network. That is  good news, most importantly because the innovation introduces a capacity increase to allow for more transactions on the network, while it also solves  transaction malleability.And, it introduces script versioning ‒ an extension to the Bitcoin protocol that allows for an entire new category of innovation.One of these imminent innovations has been on the top of several Bitcoin developers’ wish-lists for some time: Schnorr signatures.With the impending release of Segregated Witness, implementation of the Schnorr cryptographic signature algorithm might follow soon after, potentially improving Bitcoin's scalability, efficiency and privacy, all in one go.Here's how.SignaturesFirst, a brief re-cap: what are signatures?At the heart of Bitcoin lies the mathematical trick called “public key cryptography,” a cryptographic system that uses two kinds of “keys” (really strings of numbers): private keys and public keys.A private key and a public key are mathematically linked. But while it's very easy to produce a public key from a private key, it's practically impossible to produce the private key from a public key. It's a “one-way street.”In order to spend bitcoins from a particular Bitcoin address, one must prove “ownership” (or: knowledge) of the private key that refers to the public key associated with that address. And to prove ownership of a private key, without having to reveal that private key, a cryptographic signature is used.A signature is created by performing a calculation using the transaction data and the private key. And here's where the magic of public key cryptography comes in: Knowing the public key, anyone can see if the correct private key was used to create the signature. Without ever needing to know the private key itself.The “owner” of the private key can therefore sign a transaction and spend bitcoins without worrying that someone else can take that private key and steal the bitcoins; the private key is never exposed, and the signature is only valid for that specific transaction.(For a more elaborate explanation of public key cryptography in Bitcoin, see  this article. Or, just keep reading. While the basic signature concept matters, the details are not crucial for the purpose of this article.)SchnorrSo what, then, are Schnorr signatures?Schnorr, named after its inventor Claus-Peter Schnorr, is a signature scheme: the series of mathematical rules that link the private key, public key and signature together. Many cryptographers consider Schnorr signatures the best in the field, as they offer a strong level of correctness, do not suffer from malleability, are relatively fast to verify, and ‒ importantly ‒ support multisignature: several signatures can be aggregated into a single, new signature.However, until now it has not been possible to utilize Schnorr in Bitcoin. Another type of signature scheme, Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), is baked into the Bitcoin protocol, and changing that would require a hard fork.That's where Segregated Witness comes in.With Segregated Witness, all signature data is moved to a separate part of the transaction: the witness, which is not embedded in the “old” Bitcoin protocol. And thanks to script versioning, almost any rule applied in the witness can be changed through a soft fork. Including the type of signature scheme used.This opens the door for Schnorr.CapacityThe Schnorr property that stands to benefit Bitcoin most is multisignature aggregation.Many Bitcoin transactions include multiple inputs, referring to the addresses bitcoins are sent from. (This can be compared to how cash payments often consist of multiple smaller bills and coins to pay a larger sum of money.) Right now, all these inputs require their own signature, which means all these signatures must be included in a transaction, all must be transmitted over the network, and all must be included in a block.With Schnorr, however, all inputs will instead require only one combined signature to represent all these different signatures. This offers an obvious data advantage, as only one signature must be included in a transaction, only one must be transmitted over the network, and only one must be included in a block. This means there's more room for transactions.For example:Segregated Witness, as proposed by Bitcoin Core, offers a (roughly) 75 percent discount on all data included in the witness rather than the original block. One megabyte of witness data is therefore “weighed” as .25 megabyte, which would leave room for .75 megabyte transaction data in the original block, for a total of 1 megabyte.If aggregated Schnorr signatures reduce the total size of witness data, say from 1 megabyte to .5 megabyte, this .5 megabyte would then be discounted to 0.125 megabyte, leaving room for up to 0.875 megabyte in the original block. (A capacity increase of about 17 percent.)The exact amount of added room depends on the types of transactions included in blocks. But rough estimates by Bitcoin Core developer Eric Lombrozo suggest that Schnorr signatures could eventually increase total capacity 40 percent or more – that’s on top of the added 60 to 100 percent already offered by Segregated Witness.MultisigThe capacity increase as described above is true for regular transactions, as many transactions include more than one input. But the advantage can be even greater in the case of multisig transactions ‒ transactions where a single input itself requires several signatures (typically from different people).As with normal transactions, no more than a single signature needs to be included in any multisig transaction. No matter how many signatures are required, no matter how many people involved.This opens the door to vastly more complex smart contract constructions, for a fraction of the data normally required. Whether it's two-of-three, three-of-fifteen or hundred-of-hundred types of multisig transactions, all will carry the same amount of signature data as a typical single-signature transaction.PrivacyAnd third, Schnorr signatures could offer another interesting benefit: incentivized privacy.As mentioned, one transaction can include multiple inputs. Most commonly, these inputs refer to addresses that are all controlled by the same person. (As per the multiple bills and coins example.)But a privacy-enhancing trick invented by Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell,  CoinJoin, allows different users to combine all their transactions into a single transaction. That one transaction will include multiple inputs coming from different payers, which sends money to multiple outputs, belonging to different payees.(This can be compared to a group of people throwing their bills and coins together in a basket, which they use to go shopping in different stores to buy the products all of them want. Each individual will get the goods that individual paid for, but it's unlikely any individual's “own” bill paid for the product that individual bought.)If done right, CoinJoin is a great way to improve privacy on the Bitcoin protocol, as it becomes unclear which inputs paid which outputs exactly, let alone which person paid which person.CoinJoin is not a new concept. But up until now CoinJoin was typically a bit of a hassle. As such, most people don't bother. And since most people don't bother, those who do bother could automatically be marked as suspicious; potentially defeating the purpose of using CoinJoin in the first place.But Schnorr signatures can add a new advantage to CoinJoin. It enables all participants in a CoinJoin transaction to not only combine their transactions, but to also combine their signatures. And doing so means the size of the transaction would actually be smaller than all individual transactions combined. Which, in turn, means miners would typically charge a smaller fee to process the transaction.With Schnorr, therefore, CoinJoin would not only increase privacy, but also – importantly – lower the costs for everyone involved. Indeed, there would be a cost benefit to use the most private option, which might just make it the go-to option for everyone – vastly increasing Bitcoin privacy for all.Although one may assume that the demand for privacy in Bitcoin and other blockchain-based systems is coming from crypto-anarchists and libertarians, the reality is that a huge push for concealing transactions on the blockchain is coming from the traditional financial industry. During a recent cryptocurrency event at the Cato Institute, Zcash CEO and longtime cypherpunk Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn made the point that banks, clearinghouses, payment processors and everyone else he’s talked to in the financial industry are the ones who are asking for more privacy on the blockchain.Financial Industry Willing to Help Bring Privacy to BlockchainsDuring a panel focused on financial privacy at the recent Cato event, Zooko made it clear that the vast majority of the push for enhanced privacy on the blockchain is coming from banks, but this was not a dismissal of the push for privacy coming from users. Zooko claimed that the increase in privacy solutions for blockchain technologies over the past six to 12 months is a reaction to the demand coming from various financial institutions.“There is a lot of demand among users, but I don’t know how much they’re willing to stump up. Whereas the financial industry appears [ready to do so],” Zooko said.Why Is the Financial Industry Demanding Privacy?Zooko pointed to two main reasons that banks and other financial institutions need privacy for any blockchain they’re going to use:Banks are thinking about using blockchains to lower their costs, but they also understand that this technology could disrupt their industry. The idea of saving money is obviously attractive, but the disruptive properties of public ledgers are forcing financial services companies to pay close attention to the blockchain ecosystem.Financial institutions understand that the pervasive lack of privacy in shared ledgers is a roadblock for the use of blockchains in their industry.In Zooko’s view, all of the use cases that make sense for the financial industry, such as trading and settlement, require flexible layers of privacy that allow specific individuals or organizations to have access to data related to each transaction.“For both regulatory and business reasons, if you’re going to have a shared database of financial information, there is no use case that I’ve found yet where it’s OK for everyone who accesses the database to be able to read all of the financial information in the database.”Removing Read-Access from the BlockchainZooko also noted that the true innovation of Bitcoin was the way it altered how read-and-write-access works for financial ledgers. He explained:“Bitcoin was really innovative because it made write-access cryptographic instead of centralized ‒ that’s basically the most important thing about Bitcoin. At the same time, it made read-access ubiquitous ‒ everyone can read everything all the time. So this next step that we’re on the cusp of is making read-access cryptographic ... and that appears to be necessary for the applications of blockchains to all of these different [companies in the] financial industry.”Zooko added that his own company’s Zerocash-based blockchain will allow the creator of a transaction to choose who else can see the details of that transaction on the public ledger. Confidential Transactions and Enigma were two other privacy-focused blockchain improvements mentioned by Zooko at the event.The Lightning Network may well be Bitcoin’s primary solution to the issue of scalability, but many skeptics believe there are unresolved issues with this layer-2 system for the blockchain. The possibility of too much centralization via so-called “supernodes” is one of the common criticisms of the Lightning Network, and attached to that is the fear of these new, mostly -centralized payment hubs having the capacity to censor transactions.Bitcoin Magazine recently reached out to BitGo Engineer and Statoshi.info creator Jameson Lopp to get his thoughts on the possible privacy issues associated with the Lightning Network.Lightning Network May Offer Better PrivacyAlthough a loss of privacy is sometimes mentioned as a possible, negative aspect of the Lightning Network, the reality is that it may offer better privacy than the current base layer of the Bitcoin blockchain. This is mainly due to the fact that the blockchain is an open, mostly -transparent ledger that can be viewed by anyone via a block explorer.Lopp made this point during an interview with Bitcoin Magazine:“I expect that privacy will actually be better on the Lightning Network than on-chain because transactions are not broadcast to the entire network. It will be much harder to collect analytics on the Lightning Network because routing nodes only know the hop before and the hop after when routing, not the entire route.”Although not perfect, the Lightning Network does offer the advantage of keeping information related to specific transactions away from an open, transparent ledger. Whether the Lightning Network can offer better privacy than a traditional bank account (where only the bank and the parties involved in a transaction know about it) is an unknown at this point.Will Nodes Be Forced to Comply with AML and KYC Laws?One of the main concerns associated with a Lightning Network that has a few entities running nearly all of the nodes is that these nodes will be forced to comply with Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. To this point, Lopp responded, “I understand the AML/KYC fear, but routing nodes are non-custodial.”Lopp went on to explain that BitGo has based its business around being non-custodial because it means it doesn’t have to deal with all of the regulatory issues associated with holding user funds.The BitGo engineer also noted that the Lightning Network could still operate in an environment where the laws are changed to fit that regulation-avoiding model. Lopp believes that, much like the Internet, users could simply go around nodes with onerous requirements for routing payments. He added, “In that [scenario], we'll still see plenty of non-compliant nodes.”A Never-Ending Battle of Privacy vs. SurveillanceIt’s possible that the battle between privacy and surveillance will never end. Having said that, those attempting to break privacy on the Internet are usually responding to new technologies created by privacy-minded individuals and organizations.At this point, it appears that an attack on the level of privacy offered by the Lightning Network would be similar to an attack on the Tor network. Lopp told Bitcoin Magazine, “I imagine that they would need to be a well-funded attacker in order to be able to watch a significant portion of traffic.”Blockstream’s Rusty Russell and Lightning’s Olaoluwa Osuntokun have been working on bringing onion routing to the Lightning Network, and it’s clear that privacy is given the utmost respect by the developers working on this project.“I foresee a Tor-style arms race in the future on two fronts,” Russell told Bitcoin Magazine. “One will be the battle against analytics (such as timing attacks) and bugs. The other will be against centralization, which as Bitcoin is learning, is a hard problem that, which is mainly met by (1) making it easy to decentralize, and (2) making sure people are aware of the danger.”There are always tradeoffs between privacy and usability. Zcash appears to be the most privacy-conscious blockchain today, but there are a few issues with the system when it comes to efficiency. Open Transactions could also be used to implement truly anonymous digital cash, but the federated server model in that system is not as secure as a blockchain (or even the Lightning Network) when it comes to control over one’s funds.Bitcoin right now is not really anonymous. While Bitcoin addresses aren't necessarily linked to real-world identities, they can be. Monitoring the unencrypted peer-to-peer network, analysis of the public blockchain, and Know Your Customer (KYC) policy or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulation can reveal a lot about who's using Bitcoin, and for what.This is not great from a privacy perspective. Bitcoin users might not necessarily want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own, while businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors – to name some examples. Additionally, bitcoins being traceable, possibly “tainted,” and potentially worth less than other bitcoins is at odds with fungibility. This could even challenge Bitcoin's value proposition as money.But there are potential solutions to increase privacy, and improve fungibility. One of these solutions is “Confidential Transactions.”BackgroundAs opposed to most digital financial infrastructure, all typical Bitcoin transactions are recorded on the public blockchain, visible for anyone to see. This is required to validate transactions without any centralized authority, but also makes it trivial to trace how many bitcoins are sent from which addresses to which addresses.To enhance privacy, it is possible to hide the amount of bitcoins transacted. An early version of this concept, then referred to as “bitcoins with homomorphic value,” was first proposed in 2013 by hashcash inventor and current Blockstream president Dr. Adam Back. The idea was later picked up by Bitcoin Core and Blockstream developers Gregory Maxwell and Dr. Pieter Wuille and Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra. This eventually led to the implementation of Confidential Transactions in Blockstream's testnet-sidechain, Alpha.How It WorksConfidential Transactions combine and utilize several cryptographic tricks, most notably Borromean ring signatures and Pedersen commitment schemes.Without diving too deep into the cryptographic specifics, these tricks are applied so that only the sender and the receiver of a transaction are aware of the amount transacted. Everyone else would see only that bitcoins are transacted, but not know how many.The clever thing is that, while some or all amounts are masked for “onlookers,” these onlookers can still use the masked amounts for certain types of calculations. Specifically, all inputs of a transaction can be added up, all outputs can be added up, and the two sums can be compared to ensure they’re equal ‒ all while never revealing any of the masked amounts, nor the sums. As such, nodes can verify that no bitcoins were created out of thin air, without knowing how many bitcoins were actually sent.(On a side note, one of the amounts is always visible: the mining fee. That's to ensure miners can't award themselves too many fees, and has no further consequences from a privacy perspective. Other amounts can be made visible as well, if the sender or receiver so chooses.)Soft ForkPerhaps surprisingly, Confidential Transactions would be more or less compatible with the current Bitcoin-protocol. While the specifics need to be fleshed out, the solution can be rolled out as a soft fork ‒ though it might be a bit “hacky.”Here's how.To ensure that “old” (non-upgraded) and “new” (upgraded) nodes would remain in sync, bitcoins used in a Confidential Transaction would first have to be “pass through” an “anyone-can-spend” address. This is a Bitcoin address that anyone can spend from, even without the corresponding private key or signature.Or so it seems to old nodes.New nodes would recognize the address as the first step in a Confidential Transaction, and would accept only transactions from that address that do include the correct signature. As long as a majority of hash power applies these rules, the bitcoins on the anyone-can-spend address cannot be stolen by anyone who doesn’t control the corresponding private key. (Old nodes might wonder why no one is spending the freely available bitcoins. But they also wouldn't mind that no one does; from their perspective, no protocol rules are being broken.)Here's where it gets interesting.If a Confidential Transaction is made from the anyone-can-spend address, both old nodes and new nodes see that transaction. But they see something different. New nodes would recognize the transaction as a Confidential Transaction, and, for example, check that there are no bitcoins created from thin air. Old nodes, meanwhile, would be tricked into thinking it's a zero-bitcoin transaction: they would believe no bitcoins left the anyone-can-spend address at all.This logic holds for each subsequent transaction. New nodes would see new transactions, and know that some amount of bitcoin is probably moved from address to address – though they'd have no idea how many. Old nodes, all the while, see “zero-bitcoin transactions,” and believe all the bitcoins are still sitting in the anyone-can-spend address. (Old nodes might wonder why people are sending empty transactions to each other. But again, they wouldn't mind.)The reason this won't cause havoc (specifically due to incompatible UTXO-sets) is that bitcoins received through a Confidential Transaction can initially be spent only as a Confidential Transaction. They are “locked up” in the anyone-can-spend address for now, and cannot visibly move over the Bitcoin blockchain at all.In order to be able to spend these bitcoins in a normal transaction again, they must first “pass through” the original anyone-can-spend address. The receiver of a Confidential Transaction would have to send them back to the anyone-can-spend address, and from there start moving the coins in clear sight on the blockchain again.Once they start moving in clear sight again, new nodes would check that not too many coins are being moved, while old nodes would simply assume the coins are moving for the first time since they were “locked up.”As such, the anyone-can-spend address effectively functions as a cloaking device. Passing through the anyone-can-spend address makes the amounts of subsequent transactions invisible to all nodes. The bitcoins would “re-appear” only after they’ve made it back to the original anyone-can-spend address.Downsides and Trade-offsUnfortunately, Confidential Transactions are no silver bullet for privacy.Most obviously, while Confidential Transactions mask amounts, onlookers can still see which address is paying which address.But there are potential solutions to solve this as well.For one, it's trivial to create false negatives and pay zero bitcoins to several addresses to obfuscate where the bitcoins really went. Additionally, Confidential Transactions could be particularly useful in combination with CoinJoin, which combines sending and receiving addresses from several transactions into a single, large transaction.Another potential weakness of Confidential Transactions is that masked amounts are really only masked for that particular transaction. This can be rather pointless if a subsequent transaction is not a Confidential Transaction. The information from later transactions can sometimes be used to retroactively calculate how many bitcoins must have been involved in the Confidential Transaction.(For example: If Alice sends an unknown amount of bitcoins to Bob, and Bob subsequently sends 5 bitcoins to Carol and 2 to himself as change, it obviously means Alice sent 7 bitcoins to Bob.)This means that Confidential Transactions are really useful only if such use is widespread. But that brings us to a perhaps even bigger problem: Confidential Transactions are quite resource-heavy. A Confidential Transaction is about 20 times bigger than a normal transaction, while it even increases computation thirtyfold. As such, the cost of each Confidential Transaction would be significantly higher compared to typical transactions, which provides a disincentive to people actually using them – diminishing their usefulness for everyone else as well.On top of that, the sheer size of Confidential Transactions puts them at odds with either scalability (as the Bitcoin network would be able to handle fewer transactions), or decentralization (as fewer users would be able to run a full node and verify all transactions), or both.And last but not least: It's not clear that everyone agrees Bitcoin should be more private or fungible, which might further complicate rolling out potential soft forks like these.Microsoft has announced that it is collaborating with Blockstack Labs, ConsenSys and developers across the globe on an open source, self-sovereign, blockchain-based identity system that allows people, products, apps and services to interoperate across blockchains, cloud providers and organizations.The United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals include giving everyone a legal identity by 2030. As a first step, the U.N. wants to develop scalable identity systems by 2020. The inaugural \"ID2020 Summit ‒ Harnessing Digital Identity for the Global Community,\" held at the United Nations headquarters in New York on May 20, brought together policymakers and technology companies to develop an action plan.“While we don’t profess to have solutions to these overwhelming problems today, we can start where the open source community is best: collaboration,” said Yorke Rhodes III, blockchain business strategist at Microsoft. “To progress toward these goals, we have been working with partners to address identity using the self-owned or self-sovereign qualities of blockchain technology.”The Microsoft strategist said that the Redmond, Washington, giant is working with Blockstack Labs and ConsenSys to leverage their current Bitcoin and Ethereum-based identity solutions, Blockstack and uPort. Through this open source collaboration, Microsoft and its partners intend to produce a cross-chain identity solution that can be extended to any future blockchains or new kinds of decentralized, distributed systems. In the coming weeks an open-source framework for developers will be made available on Azure.Blockstack ‒ an open source blockchain application stack ‒ permits building decentralized, serverless apps by plugging into Blockstack's services for identity, naming, storage and authentication.According to the Blockstack team, Blockstack is the largest, most popular blockchain identity system, with 50,000 registered identities that come with profiles and globally unique names. Identities can be registered for people, companies, websites, software packages and more. Profiles can contain both private and public information, which is attested to by the user and can be verified by peers and select authorities.“Microsoft will make it easy to deploy new Blockstack servers and infrastructure on the Azure cloud and plans to integrate Blockstack with some internal systems for identity and authentication,” notes the Blockstack blog. “With the Blockstack technology users are in complete control of their usernames and data and don’t need to trust any third party for their information. We appreciate Microsoft’s committed to making the internet a more secure and user-centric place and to promote open-source software development.”In November Bitcoin Magazine reported that Microsoft had partnered with ConsenSys, a blockchain startup focused on Ethereum technology, founded in October 2014 by Ethereum Foundation’s co-founder Joseph Lubin. In December, Microsoft and ConsenSys announced Ethereum Blockchain as a Service (EBaaS) on Microsoft Azure, to provide a single-click cloud-based blockchain developer environment to Azure Enterprise clients and developers. In October, ConsenSys revealed that it was working on an identity management system  called uPort . “[We] have started to integrate an ID and persona construct across all of our dApps,” noted the ConsenSys blog. “Soon a uPort persona will enable access to any dApp ConsenSys or other developers build. ConsenSys has begun efforts to work with various partners towards standardization of these components.” The company added that user-owned ID and data will be crucial for realizing the compelling vision of Web 3.0.“We’re also collaborating with ConsenSys on a cross-blockchain solution for global namespaces,” notes the Blockstack blog. “We believe that a global identity system should not be dependent on any particular blockchain and users should be able to migrate from one blockchain to another, if needed. Along these lines, we plan to work with ConsenSys to add Ethereum support to the Blockstack server.”Redmond Magazine notes that there are many unofficial identity systems in the social media world, including the systems operated by Google, Facebook and Microsoft itself, as well as various emerging blockchain-based platforms that have been proposed for the online world. But the U.N. and the companies that participated in the inaugural ID2020 Summit are more ambitious: They want to develop globally recognized identity systems for the real world.One-fifth of the world’s population ‒ one and a half billion people ‒ are without proper identification, and 50 million children are born every year without a birth certificate and a legal identity. These numbers are growing, which underlines the importance of the U.N. goal of giving everyone on the planet a solid and tamper-proof digital identity based on common, interoperable standards. According to John Farmer, director of technology and civic innovation at Microsoft, blockchain technology can offer three key features to an identity system: It's an immutable, trustless, and transparent agreed-upon network.“[We] can imagine a world where an individual can register their identity in a cross blockchain fashion, providing a single namespace for lookup regardless of blockchain of choice,” concludes the Microsoft announcement. “[We are] excited by the potential societal benefits that can be derived from an identity that transcends borders, blockchains, organizations and companies.”Bitcoin right now is not really anonymous. While Bitcoin addresses aren't necessarily linked to real-world identities, they can be. Monitoring the unencrypted peer-to-peer network, analysis of the public blockchain, and Know Your Customer (KYC) policy or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulation can reveal a lot about who's using Bitcoin, and for what.This is not great from a privacy perspective. Bitcoin users might not necessarily want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own, while businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors – to name some examples.Additionally, bitcoins being traceable, possibly “tainted,” and potentially worth less than other bitcoins is at odds with fungibility. This could even challenge Bitcoin's value proposition as money.But there are potential solutions to increase privacy, and improve fungibility.One of these solutions is BIP 151, a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal designed to encrypt data among Bitcoin nodes.The ProblemTraffic over the Bitcoin network has always been unencrypted. Transactions and blocks are sent from node to node in plain sight, as are Bloom filters, which are often used by Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) nodes. All this data can, therefore, be seen by Internet Service Providers (ISPs), open-WiFi providers and anyone monitoring the Bitcoin network.This has obvious downsides. In the case of full nodes (and miners), information on where transactions and blocks originate can link Bitcoin addresses to IP addresses, which can be used to de-anonymize users. Moreover, ISPs and open-WiFi providers can potentially use the data to block certain transactions, for instance if they send bitcoins to a blacklisted address.Most SPV-wallets (or lightweight clients – and in particular those based on the Bitcoinj-library) have an additional problem. To check funds, these wallets send out so-called Bloom filters, a mathematical trick that aggregates data into a compact package. Unfortunately, this has proved insecure from a privacy perspective: The packages can be used to reconstruct which Bitcoin-addresses belong to the wallet-user.While there are some solutions available to encrypt data between nodes already, most obviously Tor and VPN, these are not ideal. For one, these solutions don't work “out-of-the-box” ‒ they require extra software and sometimes special ports. Second, users typically need to rely on infrastructure and people outside of the Bitcoin system (and in particular Tor exit nodes). And there's typically a hit to performance as well.The SolutionBIP 151, designed and recently proposed by Bitcoin Core developer Jonas Schnelli, is a straightforward solution: It encrypts traffic between nodes.To avoid potential security risks posed by the much more common TLS/SSL cryptographic standard, BIP 151 proposes to use a cryptographic standard known as “ChaCha20/Poly1305@openssh.” This standard is already used by OpenSSH and the Google-API, among other projects, and is generally considered well-proved. It offers the added advantage of speeding up network traffic; Bitcoin messages currently include a SHA256-hash (another cryptographic standard) of the content, which is relatively “heavy” to compute.With ChaCha20/Poly1305@openssh, anyone monitoring the network could still recognize packages as Bitcoin data. But they would not know the content of the data. This automatically improves privacy. Additionally, it becomes harder to censor specific transactions or blocks: ISPs or open-WiFi providers can only censor all Bitcoin-data, or none of it.RealizationWhile BIP 151 was proposed quite recently, and the review process has just started, there is as of yet little reason to think it can't be safely deployed on the Bitcoin network.In fact, since BIP 151 has no impact on Bitcoin's consensus layer, any miner, node or wallet on the network can opt in to the solution at any time – even if some other miners, nodes or wallet don't. (If one or both connected nodes don’t apply BIP 151, the data is simply transmitted in plain text – which does, of course, mean the privacy and censorship-resistant benefits don’t hold up either.)However, the solution might not be completely airtight. It could, at least in theory, be possible, for example, to analyze the encrypted data and conclude how big the message is. Comparing this with the data as it appears in mempools or on the blockchain might reveal which data was sent from a specific node. But all in all, this problem is probably negligible – and it would still be impossible to censor specific content pro-actively.And, of course, BIP 151 doesn't in itself make Bitcoin private or fungible; it's a mere part of the puzzle. Perhaps the most relevant improvement to be rolled out alongside BIP 151 is a solution for node authentication to ensure a connected peer is a genuine node, not an ISP or WiFi-provider disguised as one. Schnelli is currently working on a solution to ensure node authentication as well.Bitcoin right now is  not really anonymous. While Bitcoin addresses aren't necessarily linked to real-world identities, they can be. And it’s possible to learn a lot about who’s using Bitcoin, and for what, by monitoring the unencrypted peer-to-peer network or analysis of the public blockchain, as well as through Know Your Customer (KYC) or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations.This is not great from a privacy perspective. Bitcoin users might not necessarily want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own, while businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors – to name just a few examples.Additionally, selected bitcoins being traceable, possibly “tainted” and potentially worth less than other bitcoins is at odds with  fungibility. These privacy-related issues could even challenge Bitcoin's value proposition as money.But there are potential solutions to increase privacy and improve fungibility.One of the oldest tricks in the book is coin mixing. More recently, this trick was dusted off, improved and re-introduced in the form of “coin shuffle” protocols.Traditional MixingThe concept of mixing coins is not too complicated.If two or more people wish to obfuscate the trails of the coins they control, they can simply exchange their coins with one another. Each participant of such an exchange will end up controlling coins with a history that's not theirs, while ridding themselves of any coins that do reflect their own activity.The most straightforward way to mix coins is for users to simply connect, for instance on an internet forum, and agree to send each other specific amounts of coins. However, this option has obvious downsides. Not only must two or more users wish to exchange coins at more or less the same time (and be able to find each other) ‒ they must also trust each other not to run off with coins after receiving them.Alternatively, users can mix coins through a dedicated mixer, typically hosted on a central server. This concept is straightforward, too: users send coins to the mixer, and the mixer sends different coins back – usually minus a mixing fee. Several of these mixers already exist, such as  bitmixer.io. Some dark net markets use built-in mixers, too.Unfortunately, centralized mixers suffer from obvious weaknesses. For one, the counterparty risk still exists: Whoever controls the mixer must be trusted to actually send bitcoins back. Meanwhile, the privacy and fungibility problem is not entirely solved either: Whoever controls the mixer knows exactly which coins were exchanged for which coins, and can therefore re-establish the trail.There’s an alternate solution in CoinJoin. CoinJoin allows users to obfuscate their Bitcoin trails to the outside world by essentially combining several transactions into a single big transaction. This makes it unclear which addresses sent bitcoins to which addresses since all “to” and “from” addresses are lumped together.But with CoinJoin, trails are not necessarily obfuscated for all participants in the transaction. After all, in order to create a CoinJoin transaction, (some) participants must be able to see which addresses are sending bitcoins to which addresses.This is the problem CoinShuffle protocols solve.CoinShuffleCoinShuffle was a major breakthrough when it was first proposed by researchers from Saarland University in 2014, because it had the potential to decentralize mixing to the extent that no one needed to trust anyone else.As with typical CoinJoin transactions, CoinShuffle allows different users to submit output addresses to be included into a single transaction in order to obfuscate trails.The innovation introduced by CoinShuffle is that users can submit an output address, without revealing to anyone else which specific address they submitted. As a result, all participants will know which addresses are receiving bitcoins – but no one will know from which addresses these bitcoins are sent.This is achieved through a clever protocol.In short, all participants generate a unique public key (a random string of numbers) with which others can encrypt data, and a corresponding private key with which they themselves can decrypt it. Along a predetermined (and random) order, all participants pass their public keys around, in such a way that one user ends up with all public keys, one user ends up with all-but-one, all the way down to the user who actually got none of them.The user who got all of the public keys then encrypts his output address with all of the public keys, one for one, in the right sequence. These are layers of encryption that can only be decrypted with all the private keys, one by one, in the right order. This package is handed to the next user, who has all the public keys except for one.This user decrypts this package with his own private key; he “peels” one layer of the encryption-onion, but still can't tell which output address is “hidden underneath.” Additionally, he encrypts his own output address with all the public keys (but one), and passes both encrypted packages on to the next user. This next user has no idea which package originally came from which user. But he can peel another encryption layer off of both. And, of course, he can encrypt his own output address with all public keys that he got, and pass three encrypted packages on to the next.This goes on until the very last user, who gets packages containing all the other output addresses, encrypted. But at this point, all the packages have only one layer of encryption left; and this last user can decrypt all of them at once. He then adds his own output address into the mix, constructs one big CoinJoin transaction, and sends it back to all participants to sign.At this point, all participants can simply verify that their output addresses are  included in the transaction, sign it and broadcast the transaction. (It doesn't really matter who broadcasts, exactly.) No one will ever know who provided which output address.The much-used  Mycelium Bitcoin wallet might soon include an implementation of the CoinShuffle protocol, that Mycelium has named  Shufflepuff.CoinShuffle++While CoinShuffle works as intended, the protocol requires a significant number of steps to complete, which makes it somewhat impractical for day-to-day use. The same researchers from Saarland University, therefore, more recently proposed an improved solution:  CoinShuffle++. CoinShuffle++ essentially does what CoinShuffle does, but faster and better.Where participants in CoinShuffle generate public and private key pairs, participants in a CoinShuffle++ transaction create “mutual secrets” ‒ also unique strings of numbers. Each participant shares such a string with every other participant, but each shared secret is shared only among two of them; no more, no less.All participants then “mask” their own output using all the secrets they share. But importantly, these shared secrets are used as both negative values as well as positive values for each pair of participants. (If one participant masks his output with the shared secret 12345, the other participant masks his output with -12345.)This allows for a nifty trick, as descibed in the Dining cryptographers problem. Once all participants share their masked outputs, they can combine these in such a way that all shared secrets cancel each other out. What's left, at that point, is the grand combination of all outputs – unmasked.The next challenge is to extract the specific outputs from the combination of all outputs. That's where another mathematical trick comes into play: so-called  Newton Identities. The technical details of this trick are unfortunately beyond the scope of this article, as it wanders far into the complexity of advanced mathematics. But it is essentially accomplished using several different redundant encodings of the message, which participants can apply to locally extract all the original output addresses – without knowing who provided which address.And importantly, this can be done in a single go, to make it much faster and more efficient than the original CoinShuffle protocol. According to the Saarland University researchers, up to 50 participants may complete the CoinShuffle++ protocol in about 15 seconds; potentially even fast enough for typical point-of-sale situations.Trade-Offs and WeaknessesLike most other anonymizing solutions, CoinShuffle protocols improve privacy and fungibility. But they are insufficient to provide full anonymity and fungibility in and of themselves – nor are they free from any weakness.As one drawback of both CoinShuffle protocols, they can be frustrated by dishonest participants. If even just one of the participants wants to block a successful “shuffle” he can insert “fake” (encrypted) data in the process (or not partake in his part of the process at all).It is, however, possible to trace the participant trying to frustrate the protocol. As such, the protocol can trivially be restarted without this specific participant. This increases the total time for all mixing, but mixing will complete.Additionally, many of the weaknesses that pertain to typical CoinJoin transactions hold up for shuffle protocols as well. Most important, if the different amounts sent in the collective transaction aren't equal, it might be possible to figure out which inputs and outputs correspond – defeating the purpose entirely.Likewise, if all of the “participants” are really one and the same entity pretending to be several – a  Sybil attack – no amount of mixing will make any difference: that one entity can simply connect the only inputs and outputs that aren't his.Bitcoin right now is not really anonymous. While Bitcoin addresses aren't necessarily linked to real-world identities, they can be. Monitoring the unencrypted peer-to-peer network, analysis of the public blockchain and know your customer (KYC) policy or anti-money laundering (AML) regulation can reveal a lot about who's using Bitcoin and for what.This is not ideal from a privacy perspective. To show some examples; Bitcoin users might not want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own, while businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors.Additionally, bitcoins being traceable, possibly “tainted” and potentially worth less than other bitcoins is at odds with fungibility. This could even challenge Bitcoin's value proposition as money.One solution to increase privacy and protect fungibility is to exchange bitcoins for fiat currency without being required to identify yourself.The ProblemExchanges, brokerages, money transmitters and other service providers that serve as the “on-ramps” and “off-ramps” between bitcoin and fiat currency, form an important part of the Bitcoin ecosystem. But from a privacy and fungibility perspective, a heavy reliance on these companies is not ideal: Practically all fiat-facing bitcoin-companies are required to apply AML/KYC-checks on their customers.Moreover, these checks can be (and are sometimes) combined with wider blockchain-analysis, pertaining to the past trail of bitcoins, to in some cases even monitor where bitcoins move to after leaving these services. This allows for extensive mapping of the Bitcoin ecosystem. (In a recent blog post, R3CEV Director of Market Research Tim Swanson even described this as a “de facto Kimberley Process”.) There are some ways to avoid these kinds of checks. Most obviously, users can exchange bitcoins for fiat outside of any exchange, for example, at Bitcoin meetups. But it becomes a bit more tricky online: Users need to trust their counterparty or maybe a dedicated middleman to actually send the bitcoins or wire the fiat currency. Alternatively, converting bitcoins to fiat currency can be done by purchasing Bitcoin debit cards such as Cryptopay or BitPlastic. Converting fiat currency to bitcoins, vouchers such as the Bitupcard may also offer a solution.Most of these options, however, are rather expensive, clunky or both.Local ExchangeA perhaps more sophisticated solution is the use of exchanges that don't require identity-checks; there are several.The earliest of such alternatives is the Finland-based exchange LocalBitcoins, launched in 2012. As opposed to typical exchanges, LocalBitcoins is a platform that does not touch fiat currency itself. Instead, users send the fiat through typical wire transfers or other methods. And, as the name of the website suggests, users can also meet up locally and trade bitcoins for cash on the spot. This allows LocalBitcoins to be more lenient when it comes to AML/KYC-policies – although some sellers do require their counterparty to identify themselves through the LocalBitcoins-platform to some degree. (In the United States, some LocalBitcoins.com sellers have been charged under anti-money laundering laws.)Building on this concept in 2014, the Mycelium mobile Bitcoin wallet introduced Local Trader: a Bitcoin exchange built right into the wallet. Mycelium users who want to buy or sell bitcoins for cash can make an offer on the Mycelium platform where they indicate a price and maximum distance they’re willing to travel. Once a match is made with another trader, they can meet up and complete the trade locally, typically with cash. The Bitcoin side of the trade is taken care of in-app, which also includes a reputation system.Decentralized ExchangeHowever, even if the fiat side of the trade is handled locally, LocalBitcoins and Mycelium types of solutions still rely on a central intermediary to some extent: LocalBitcoins and Mycelium. And in the end, these companies can be required to apply AML/KYC-types of regulation as well - or be shut down entirely. (LocalBitcoins had to cease its operations in Germany back in 2014.) An interesting alternative, therefore, is fully decentralized exchanges that rely on no central intermediary to process fiat or Bitcoin transactions.A first attempt at establishing a decentralized exchange was Coinffeine, launched in late 2013. Coinfeinne partly solved the counterparty risk – the risk of a trading partner not paying up – through a combination of security deposits and an incremental trading protocol. In short, both parties in a trade, deposit a specific amount of bitcoins into a two-of-two multi-address, requiring a signature from each to unlock. Subsequently, the trading partners trade in incremental amounts: no single trade is bigger than the security deposit. As such, neither trader has an incentive not to pay their part: they would lose their security deposit worth the same amount if they did.Coinfeinne is a novel idea, but it doesn't hold up as nicely in practice. The security deposits leave room for certain types of fraud or extortion. A victim might, for instance, prefer to get half of his deposit back rather than nothing at all. Additionally, trading in incremental amounts is not exactly user-friendly nor fast, especially if it takes a wire transfer to complete each time.More recently, the decentralized Bitcoin exchange Bitsquare launched. Bitsquare solved the counterparty problem with dedicated arbiters, as well as – again – security deposits. These deposits are locked up along with the traded bitcoins in a two-of-three multisig address where the third key is held by a dedicated and mutually agreed upon arbiter. As such, the buyer is incentivized to send the fiat currency; he'll lose his deposit otherwise. And once he receives the fiat curremcy, the seller is incentivized to release the bitcoins for the same reason. If either attempts to cheat, the arbitrator helps the victim get his bitcoins. To prevent bank-chargeback fraud, Bitsquare limits trades to a maximum between .75 and 1.5 each, for now.Bitcoin, right now, is not really anonymous. While Bitcoin addresses aren't necessarily linked to real-world identities, they can be. Monitoring the unencrypted peer-to-peer network, analysis of the public blockchain and know your customer (KYC) policy or anti-money laundering (AML) regulation can reveal a lot about who's using bitcoin and for what.This is not great from a privacy perspective. Bitcoin users might not necessarily want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own, while businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors, to name some examples.Additionally, bitcoins being traceable, possibly “tainted,” and potentially worth less than other bitcoins is at odds with fungibility. This could even challenge bitcoin's value proposition as money.But there are potential solutions to increase privacy and improve fungibility.One solution to address this issue – Stealth Transactions – was introduced in 2014; and a new twist on this concept – Reusable Payment Codes – was proposed last year.The ProblemIn part to increase privacy (there are security benefits as well), it is recommended that Bitcoin users generate a brand new address for each transaction they receive. While this is not an airtight solution in itself, this can make it significantly harder to connect addresses to real world identities ‒ both on the sending and the receiving end of the transaction.However, this also means that the receiver must share a new Bitcoin address with the sender each time a transaction is to be made. This can be a bit of a hassle and in some cases even impossible (think of donation addresses posted on websites). And it’s not ideal from a privacy perspective either: If the new addresses are shared over an insecure channel, privacy is potentially lost entirely.Stealth Transactions, first proposed in 2014 by Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd, are designed to solve these problems. They use several cryptographic tricks, mostly based on Diffie-Hellman key exchange, to let users accept payments on addresses they never generated, nor have even seen before.Under the HoodThis is how Stealth Transactions work “under the hood.”[Authors note: Since completion of this article, it was brought to my attention that there are actually several slightly different ways to construct Stealth Transactions. The strategy described here is only one particular option.]Stealth Transactions require the sender and receiver of a transaction to have a (basically non-Bitcoin-related) cryptographic public and private key pair, each. We'll call these the “stealth private keys” and the “stealth public keys.” These “stealth keys” are used in several ways.The first way is a fairly basic use-case of cryptography, which is, for example, used to encrypt emails. In short (and a bit simplified), the sender can take the receiver's stealth public key and use it to encrypt a message. The receiver – and only the receiver – will be able to decrypt this message with his stealth private key.(This works the other way around as well, of course: The receiver could encrypt a message for the sender – but that's not really relevant for Stealth Transactions.)The second trick is slightly more complex. But, again, in simplified form, both stealth private keys can be combined through a mathematical formula, to create a Bitcoin private key. This Bitcoin private key can, in turn, be used to generate a corresponding Bitcoin address. So, using each other’s stealth private key in combination with their own, both sender and receiver can generate this Bitcoin private key and Bitcoin address.And there is a third trick, in simplified form: This Bitcoin address (but not the corresponding Bitcoin private key) can also be derived from one of the stealth private keys and one of the stealth public keys. As such, either the sender or the receiver can generate the Bitcoin address by combining their own stealth private key with the other's stealth public key.In PracticeTo make a Stealth Transaction, these three tricks are cleverly combined:Possibly even before any payment was going to be made, the receiver generates a stealth key pair. It's this stealth public key that he,for example, posts on his website as a donation address. (As such, it’s also called the “Stealth Address.”) He doesn't share his stealth private key with anyone at all.When the sender wants to pay the receiver, he generates a “throwaway” stealth private key for himself; specifically for that one transaction. (It’s actually a “nonce”; just a random string of numbers – but has the same effect.) He then takes the receiver's stealth public key (or Stealth Address) and combines this with his own throwaway stealth private key, to generate a Bitcoin address and sends bitcoins to this Bitcoin address. (Well, almost... but let's assume that for a moment.)At this point, no one can spend the bitcoins on this address because no one knows (nor is able to generate) the corresponding Bitcoin private key.But here's the heart of the trick: the sender can allow the receiver to spend the bitcoins by sharing his throwaway stealth private key with him. With that throwaway stealth private key, the receiver would have both stealth private keys required to generate the Bitcoin private key.Interestingly, this is accomplished all at once, within the transaction that funds the Bitcoin address. Specifically, the sender includes a so-called OP_RETURN “message” in that transaction. This message consists of his throwaway private key, but encrypted using the receiver's public key, so no one but the receiver can decrypt it.To receive this transaction, the receiver monitors the blockchain for OP_RETURN transactions and tries to decrypt all of them. Once he finds a decryptable OP-RETURN message, he also finds the throwaway stealth private key to combine with his own stealth private key, with which he can generate the Bitcoin private key to spend the bitcoins in that transaction.The receiver will have received a secure payment on an address he didn't even own until the actual payment was made. Meanwhile, the outside world might not even know it was a Stealth Transaction; all they see is a normal Bitcoin-transaction with an undecipherable OP_RETURN message attached.Reusable Payment CodesWhile Stealth Transactions offer a novel solution, the requirement to monitor the blockchain for OP_RETURN transactions do limit their potential. Specifically, light wallets typically don't store the entire blockchain and are, therefore, unable to receive Stealth Transactions. (DarkWallet, the only wallet that allows for Stealth Transactions so far, “outsources” this task to a server, which is not ideal for privacy.)Reusable Payment Codes, introduced by Bitcoin developer Justus Ranvier in late 2015, are designed to solve this problem. They use another Bitcoin innovation designed by Bitcoin Core developer Dr. Pieter Wuille: The Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) key creation and transfer protocol. In short, this protocol allows for the creation of a series of seemingly independent Bitcoin private keys and addresses from a single seed.With Reusable Payment Codes, the sender sends a so-called “extended public key” to the receiver through an otherwise normal transaction. With this extended public key and the (“stealth”) public key as published by the receiver, the sender is able to generate a series of Bitcoin addresses to send bitcoins to. The receiver, meanwhile, can use this extended public key to combine it with his own (“stealth”) private key to generate the corresponding Bitcoin private keys.As such, the sender can send an almost unlimited amount of transactions to the receiver, to addresses that can only be “linked together” by the sender and the receiver. Onlookers will see normal Bitcoin transactions ‒ not knowing they all go to the same receiver; all while the receiver hasn’t published any of them anywhere.However, since light wallets don’t monitor the blockchain, the initial “notification” transaction to serve as a “piggy back” for the seed-data is recognizable, as such, to the outside world. This might reveal who is transacting if the addresses can be linked to real-world identities. Even then, it would reveal only who is transacting; not how much or on which subsequent addresses.In a new partnership, LexisNexis Risk Solutions, a global big-data technology and analytics firm, has integrated its anti-money laundering data into Elliptic’s Bitcoin transaction monitoring and compliance products. As a result, clients of Elliptic’s blockchain intelligence service can obtain more meaningful insights by automatically screening Bitcoin entities for links to sanctions, enforcement, politically exposed persons, adverse media and state-owned companies, as well as “exposing money launderers, human traffickers, terrorists and drug dealers who use Bitcoin to make dark web purchases.”“The lack of financial transparency on Bitcoin entities continues to stymie the ubiquitous adoption of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies,” notes a joint press release. “That reality, though, is soon to be short-lived.”Elliptic, a blockchain security and compliance company established in London in 2013, strives to be  “the global standard for blockchain intelligence” by transferring the rigorous security and compliance standards of traditional finance to the world of digital currencies. “We identify illicit activity on the Bitcoin blockchain and provide actionable intelligence to financial institutions and law enforcement agencies.” In July, for example, Elliptic and the Internet Watch Foundation announced a partnership to monitor and report Bitcoin transactions related to child pornography.LexisNexis Risk Solutions, part of RELX Group, combines cutting-edge technology, data and advanced analytics to provide information that helps customers across industries and government predict, assess and manage risk. It is used by one hundred of the top U.S. banks and the firm also works with eighty percent of U.S. federal agencies, assisting with regulatory compliance and mitigating business risk, such as identity fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion, International Business Times reports.“This alliance demonstrates how data, technology and analytics can be used in innovative ways to foster financial transparency from China to Germany to the U.S.,” said Thomas C. Brown, senior vice president of U.S. Commercial Markets and Global Market Development at LexisNexis Risk Solutions.“More banks, Fintech startups, payments companies and eCommerce businesses can further consider the usefulness of the permissionless blockchain because as of today they are able to deploy best-of-breed money laundering screening against Bitcoin. As a result, the virtual currency potential evolves to a new level — from possible conduit for money laundering to trusted technology along the economic value chain.”Detecting money laundering is complicated because, of course, those who engage in illicit activities put all sorts of smokescreens in place and often have enough money to spend on counter-detection measures. For example, according to data provided by Elliptic, the largest dark marketplaces facilitate more than $250 million in annual sales.“For the first time, Bitcoin companies can leverage bank-grade risk management practices to identify Bitcoin entities that appear on sanction and watch lists from around the world,” said Dr. James Smith, Elliptic CEO and co-founder. “Having this enriched data set built natively into Elliptic’s products takes Bitcoin AML and KYC controls to the next level.”Smith added that leading Bitcoin companies globally are using Elliptic products to assess risk on more than $1 billion in Bitcoin transactions each month. “By integrating LexisNexis Risk Solutions’ robust watchlist data, we are making it safe for a new wave of financial institutions to handle Bitcoin and bank Bitcoin companies,” he said.Its new partnership with LexisNexis has created a service to bring bank-grade anti-money laundering (AML) controls to Bitcoin transactions, making the virtual currency more attractive to those who might want to use it for legitimate transactions, Reuters reports.According to both companies, Bitcoin operators need to demonstrate strict compliance with AML and KYC (know your customer) if they want to be taken seriously in the financial world at large, and therefore the new monitoring solution can help in mainstreaming the emerging distributed ledger economy. However, it’s to be expected that those who want to escape detection — not always for illicit reasons — will increasingly resort to non-Bitcoin alternatives able to provide enhanced privacy.In June 2015 Bitcoin Magazine covered the launch of “The Bitcoin Big Bang,” an interactive visualization that plots the emergence and interconnectivity of the key players in Bitcoin since its genesis in 2009. It was described as a breakthrough in Bitcoin transaction monitoring and compliance. According to the company, monitoring and compliance services help digital currency businesses to gain credibility and establish good relations with banks and mainstream financial operators.Of course, operators such as Elliptic and Chainalysis, a Swiss company that provides similar services, are often criticized by parts of the Bitcoin community, especially libertarian early adopters. However, it seems likely that monitoring and compliance services are here to stay and grow.In the aftermath of the recent theft of more than $65 million worth of bitcoins from Bitfinex, parts of the Bitcoin community have been wondering what role BitGo’s multisig-focused security offering may have played in the whole ordeal.According to the company’s website, BitGo handles more than 10,000 Bitcoin transactions per day and helps its users transfer more than $1 billion worth of value per month. Many exchanges, such as Bitstamp and Kraken, use BitGo’s services.Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Bitstamp Head of Business Development Vasja Zupan to get the exchange’s thoughts on BitGo in light of the recent hack.Sticking with BitGoWhen asked whether Bitstamp has had any second thoughts about its use of BitGo’s multisig architecture, Zupan was quick to come to the blockchain security company’s defense. “For now, Bitstamp does not see any reason for second thoughts about using BitGo’s technology,” he said. “We believe that proper implementation, regular audits, and overall strong security policies make all the difference.”Zupan went on to point out that Bitstamp was the first exchange to implement the combination of cold storage with a multisig hot wallet. “We are confident in our system,” he added.Differences with the Bitfinex SetupWhile some traders may be concerned Bitstamp is using the same security offering used by Bitfinex during the hack, Zupan attempted to ease these worries by pointing out that Bitstamp’s multisig implementation is “fundamentally different from that of Bitfinex.”“Bitstamp uses BitGo exclusively for its hot wallet, where only a small amount of bitcoins are kept (below 2 percent),” Zupan continued. “The vast majority of our bitcoins are stored offline in cold storage.”Bitstamp was the victim of a hack in January of 2015. More than $5 million worth of bitcoin were stolen in the theft. The good news was that, unlike Bitfinex, the vast majority of Bitstamp’s funds were held in cold storage. Ironically, it was this hack that prompted Bitstamp to partner with BitGo for its multisig security offering.Zupan also discussed other aspects of how his company’s exchange is structured to reassure traders that its system is secure.“Aware that monitoring is crucial in the industry, we are the first virtual currency exchange to get formal oversight in place,” he said. “A key component of this is our recently acquired licence, which requires constant external financial audits, code reviews and penetration tests, examinations and the regular reporting of our financial balances. This provides the security our users require.”“In our view, this unfortunate incident only serves to further confirm the importance of compliance, corporate governance, regulatory monitoring and auditing for virtual currency services,” Zupan added. “We, of course, hope that this issue will be resolved quickly and with a positive outcome for Bitfinex and its customers.”Reasoning Behind Bitfinex’s Storage SetupOne of the main questions being asked of Bitfinex in the aftermath of the hack is why it decided to eliminate the cold storage aspect of its storage setup. This question was at least partially answered by Bitfinex’s Zane Tackett on the Whalepool Teamspeak server over the weekend.“There were a lot of reasons for why we went with this implementation with BitGo; one, a big one, was transparency,” said Tackett. “Everyone has their own wallet that they can watch on the blockchain. They can see their bitcoin at any time, and we settle it once per day.”Tackett argued that since Bitfinex offers such a high level of transparency, it is unable to cover things up when funds are lost or stolen. The details of how the exchange will secure its bitcoins in the future are unknown at this time.The Sandia National Laboratories, a major United States Department of Energy research and development facility, with campuses in Albuquerque, New Mexico and Livermore, California, managed and operated by the Sandia Corporation (a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin), is joining the war on Bitcoin anonymity.Sandia researchers have created a set of requirements for an analysis tool that can be used to fight the use of bitcoin by criminals. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology (S&T) directorate requested that Sandia set up a graphical user interface or a front end on the Sandia research environment so DHS agents can test the algorithms Sandia is using in actual investigations. The result of Sandia’s work could eventually be delivered to other federal law enforcement agencies.It’s worth noting that Sandia, adopting a position that is now becoming widespread among financial operators, institutions and administrations, is persuaded that Bitcoin is here to stay and is poised to have a disruptive but positive impact on the economy. The problem is that the potential for anonymity offered by Bitcoin has been and continues to be exploited by criminals to escape detection.“In many ways, figuring out how to effectively combat illicit Bitcoin commerce and reduce its perception as a tool of criminals can encourage more people and companies to adopt Bitcoin for legitimate purposes,” said Sandia researcher, Andrew Cox, who is leading the project.“Our job was to understand how Bitcoin works,” added Cox. “Bitcoin is a new, semi-anonymous currency that holds the potential to change the way all sorts of transactions work in a way that might really benefit the economy. Some of the potential benefits include making monetary transactions much more efficient and thereby driving down the costs of doing business, making transaction histories more transparent, which could help both financial markets and financial regulation and, depending on who you ask, reducing the risks associated with inflation and reliance on centralized monetary institutions. All that being said, it has been clear that criminals have been pioneers in using Bitcoin. They use it for drugs, for guns, child pornography and all sorts of terrible stuff.”A solution is abandoning Bitcoin and re-using specific aspects of its underlying blockchain technologies to create non-anonymous digital currencies with some of the other desired features of Bitcoin — cheap transactions permanently recorded in a tamper-proof ledger. This is the approach followed by “permissioned blockchains” and current plans for central bank issued digital currencies.However, it’s not certain that a permissioned, centrally controlled blockchain could leverage the network effect that powers Bitcoin. Legendary cryptographer Nick Szabo and other experts are persuaded that banks should embrace the crowd-sourced power and resiliency of permissionless blockchains like Bitcoin.Another solution is to de-anonymize bitcoin transactions with blockchain network analysis tools such as those developed by companies like Elliptic and Chainalysis. In fact, bitcoin transactions are not anonymous. The full transaction history of any bitcoin address, including every transaction associated with that address, is permanently recorded in the tamper-proof public blockchain and is open to analysis. The illusion of anonymity stems from the pseudonymous nature of bitcoin addresses, which are not explicitly associated with their owners, although blockchain network analysis can often de-anonymize bitcoin users. This is Sandia’s approach.According to Cox, there is no “silver bullet” algorithm to effectively de-anonymize Bitcoin. To do so would involve cross-referencing anonymous data with other, traditional sources of investigative data to identify suspects. “To be successful, the reality is it’s going to take different types of algorithms and additional types of investigative techniques including good old-fashioned police work,” said Cox. “They’re all going to have to be combined.”The Sandia team set up a research testbed to experiment with algorithms that can de-anonymize illicit Bitcoin users, including a mix of traditional and novel investigative techniques. Of course, the criminals try to evade detection by using different bitcoin addresses, but the Sandia research results show that known methods often reveal that the same users are using the different Bitcoin addresses.“It doesn’t mean that we get their actual names because there aren’t any names associated with Bitcoin,” said Cox. “But it will show that some transactions are controlled by the same user.” Then, when one of the transactions is de-anonymized and linked to a criminal, law enforcement will be able to refer back to the rest of the associated Bitcoin addresses they need to deal with. “Our clients are happy about the requirements we’ve developed and the research we’ve done on what types of tools and capabilities are needed,” concluded Cox.The researchers are now in the process of generating their own methods by characterizing transactions of Bitcoin users and applying machine learning methods to uncover patterns of interest.The dark web has started to embrace Monero, a privacy-conscious alternative to Bitcoin.First, the operators of SIGAINT, a commonly used dark web email provider, decided to host a full node for Monero light wallets. Then, an eight-month-old darknet market called Oasis decided to allow vendors to accept Monero. Finally, Alphabay, the largest darknet market in operation right now, announced the first phase of Monero implementation on their platform.Why Monero?Staff members at Alphabay and Oasis say that customers and vendors have simply demanded the Monero option. “It's a lot more secure than Bitcoin, especially when it comes to obfuscation,” said an anonymous member of the Alphabay support staff.Although the darknet marketplaces tend to get negative press, the reality is that many of them bend over backwards for their customers; at least until they (some of them)  exit scam. “We have received a lot of requests about it; we've studied the cryptocurrency, and we've decided to implement it,” said an Oasis staff member. “This is what we do when users (both customers and vendors) suggest that we implement or change features. We love to hear back from everyone.”The hidden service set up by the operators of SIGAINT acts in a manner similar to Electrum for those who are familiar with that particular Bitcoin wallet. The hidden service allows individuals to use lightweight Monero clients as opposed to running a full node on their own. When visiting the hidden service via the Tor Browser, information about Monero is shown, including the following message:\"The SIGAINT operators firmly believe that Monero is the next logical step in Darknet commerce. It solves most of the privacy problems that plague cryptocurrency systems such as Bitcoin.\"Bitsquare and ShapeShift.io appear to be the two options for obtaining Monero via Tor at the moment.Why Not Dash or Zcash?In addition to their reasons for supporting Monero, the SIGAINT operators have reasons not to prefer other options, such as Dash or Zcash. In the case of Dash, the site operators are wary of possible collusion by that digital currency’s supernodes. With Zcash, the operators are concerned about the company’s registration in the United States, the fact that mixing is done on an opt-in basis and the possibility of secret inflation initiated by the maintainers of the system.The site operators also claim CoinJoin is not enough to maintain transaction unlinkability in Bitcoin. In a Reddit comment, Bitcoin Core contributor Luke-Jr seemed sympathetic to this viewpoint. “Only a fool would use Bitcoin as it is today for darknet,” he stated.The staff members of Alphabay and Oasis seemed less inclined to talk about other privacy-centric digital currencies. “Haven't read about [them] yet,” said an Alphabay staff member when asked about Dash and Zcash.One staff member from Oasis, which runs on donations, made it clear that they’re mainly interested in keeping their customers happy:“Users requested the Monero implementation; we wouldn't have done anything without their request. There are tons of other cryptocurrencies out there and we obviously cannot implement them all. We will always be based first on our users’ feedback.”What Does This Mean for Bitcoin?Bitcoin’s main value proposition is as a fungible, bearer ecash that cannot be censored or tracked, but it’s unclear whether Monero will be able to chip away at the leading digital currency’s nearly $10 billion market cap. The price of Monero roughly doubled in the aftermath of these darknet announcements before coming back down to the 0.007 BTC area.Although staff members from Alphabay and Oasis did not seem philosophically married to Bitcoin in their comments to Bitcoin Magazine, Monero faces many challenges on the road toward more widespread adoption on the dark web or as a store of value. Even Riccardo Spagni, a well-known Monero developer, does not tell people they should buy Monero. Instead, he views it as a place of experimentation for features that cannot currently be tested on Bitcoin. It’s possible that this sort of testing will take place on Bitcoin sidechains in the near future.Even in a scenario where Monero gains traction on the dark web, it’s unclear if that would be enough for it to become a preferred store of value. Bitcoin still has a much longer track record and a much more liquid market, so it’s possible that darknet market customers and vendors will use Monero as an appcoin more than anything else, even if moving in and out of the Monero system would harm their privacy.The push toward Monero on the dark web is a development worth watching, but it’s not the first time a darknet market has accepted an alternative, privacy-conscious digital currency. Two small markets accepted Dash (then called Darkcoin) in late 2014, but the altcoin was not able to gain any traction on the dark web. Time will tell if things will go differently for Monero.Bitcoin right now is not really anonymous. While Bitcoin addresses aren't necessarily linked to real-world identities, they can be. Monitoring the unencrypted peer-to-peer network, analyses of the public blockchain and Know Your Customer (KYC) policy or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations can reveal a lot about who's using Bitcoin and for what.This is not great from a privacy perspective. For example, Bitcoin users might not necessarily want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own; similarly, businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors.Additionally, the fact that the transaction history of each bitcoin is traceable puts the fungibility of all bitcoins at risk. “Tainted” bitcoins, for example, may be valued less than other bitcoins, possibly even calling into question Bitcoin's value proposition as money.There are potential solutions that may increase privacy and improve fungibility in Bitcoin. But most of these solutions are either partial, works-in-progress or just largely theoretical.To reclaim their privacy right now, therefore, some bitcoiners have begun to utilize one of its competitors: the altcoin Monero.The Bitcoin ScenarioPerhaps the main reason Bitcoin does not offer a whole lot of privacy is that different transactions are easily linked together.This is because all Bitcoin transactions consist of inputs and outputs. Inputs refer to addresses bitcoins are sent “from” and outputs refer to addresses bitcoins are sent “to”. Naturally, then, outputs from one transaction become inputs in the next. The receiver of one output and the sender of the subsequent input are usually the same person.Moreover, since most transactions are made by one person only, all input addresses typically belong to that same person as well. Meanwhile, that one person usually sends bitcoins to only one other person per transaction. That means that if there are two different outputs, one of these must be a change address, used by the sender to send excess bitcoins back to himself.All these links in the chain make individual bitcoins traceable; it’s possible to determine in which transactions a certain bitcoin was previously used, thereby potentially harming fungibility and decreasing privacy, as all these links allow blockchain analysts to figure out which bitcoins likely belong(ed) to whom.The Monero ScenarioAs opposed to the majority of altcoins, Monero is not based on Bitcoin’s code-base or protocol. Instead, the cryptocurrency, launched in 2014, is based on the CryptoNote reference implementation, an altcoin that was designed from scratch.Monero was created by the pseudonymous developer thankful for today, who was himself effectively “fired” by the community less than a month after Monero’s launch, as the project was forked away from him. It has since been led by a core team of seven developers, including Riccardo “fluffypony” Spagni and Francisco “ArticMine” Cabañas. Its native curreny, XMR, is one of the top altcoins by market cap, and is now accepted as payment on several dark net markets.In Monero, the basic structure of Bitcoin transactions still holds up: each consists of inputs (“from”) and outputs (“to”). But there are two key differences. For one, outputs can only consist of rounded decimal numbers. So instead of an output worth 15.7 XMR, there will be three outputs, worth 10, 5 and 0.7 XMR. And the change outputs are also rounded. So if the input was worth, say, 60 XMR, the change outputs will be worth 40, 4 and 0.3 XMR for a combined output total of 60. Six outputs (40, 10, 5, 4, 0.7 and 0.3), where only the sender and receiver know which ones are payments and which are change. This already makes blockchain analysis a bit harder.But this is really only the setup of the trick.Ring signaturesThe actual magic comes from a cryptographic signature scheme called “ring signatures,” based on the older concept of “group signatures.” Ring signatures exist as several iterations and variations, but all share the property of obfuscating which cryptographic key signed “which” message, while still proving “that” a cryptographic key signed “a” message. The version used by Monero is called “Traceable Ring Signatures,” invented by Eiichiro Fujisaki and Koutarou Suzuki.Taking the example above, where an input worth 60 XMR was used to create six outputs, Monero utilizes ring signatures as follows.The sender who created the 60 XMR input must have previously received these 60 XMR as an output of an earlier transaction. After all, he can only create a 60 XMR input if he controls a 60 XMR output first.But with ring signatures, the sender can obfuscate “which” 60 XMR output he controlled. Instead, he can take several 60 XMR outputs from different transactions, and bundle them together in such a way that proves he owns “one” of these outputs — without revealing “which one”. And since Monero only works with round numbers, there should be plenty of 60 XMR outputs available on the blockchain to mix with.As a result, Monero transactions are almost completely unlinkable. At best, blockchain-analysts can calculate the odds that transactions are linked, based on how many outputs were used in the mix to create an input. (This is configurable by the sender, with a minimum of three.)And Back Again...So how does any of this help Bitcoin or Bitcoin users?Simple: Monero is used to “unlink” Bitcoin transactions in much the same way that Monero transactions are themselves unlinked.Specifically, Bitcoin users sell bitcoin for XMR, ideally on a Tor-friendly exchange that does not require AML/KYC, like Shapeshift or Bitsquare. Later, they simply sell these XMR back for bitcoin on a different platform, which can also be done on XMR.to. If the buys and sells are spread over time a bit (since low transaction volume on Monero can be a slight giveaway in some cases), this leaves virtually no link on any blockchain at all.In what’s turning into the “year of the hack,” security issues are increasingly top of mind for those working in the Bitcoin and blockchain space.Security expert Pamela Morgan is CEO of Third Key Solutions, attorney at Empowered Law PLLC, and board member of C4. She and her partners at Third Key Solutions, Andreas M. Antonopoulos (CTO) and Richard Kagan (Business Advisor), provide advice and security solutions for wallets, exchanges, crowd sales, and new innovative Bitcoin and blockchain projects.Bitcoin and Blockchain \"More Secure Than Ever Before\"In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Pamela Morgan noted the contradiction that, despite recent events, Bitcoin and blockchain technologies may actually be more secure now than ever before:“Bitcoin is more secure than it has ever been and it keeps getting stronger. The same is true for several other blockchains that increase their security as they mature and broaden their reach. But this is seemingly contradicted by frequent hacks affecting many users.”“The contradiction lies in a subtle but important difference: Funds controlled directly by individuals in a decentralized manner and secured by decentralized blockchain protocols are extremely secure.”“On the contrary, when a single entity concentrates control of funds from many individuals with custodial (aka hot) wallet accounts or poorly implemented large cold storage wallets, they become an extremely attractive target — a honeypot for attackers.”Security Becomes an Important Priority for EthereumOne such entity, the Ethereum DAO, suffered a cyber attack in June (losing one-third of its total funds) and the subsequent split into Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.This tested Ethereum’s vulnerabilities and, among other measures, resulted in the hiring of Martin Holst Swende, a former NASDAQ information security specialist.Swende will work with Ethereum Foundation-funded projects to enhance their security and will be responsible for Ethereum’s overall security during its ongoing development, working with smart contract developers and creating a special security website.“Unintended Consequences Such as the Re-entrancy Bug”We asked Morgan about her take on the unprecedented Ethereum DAO attack. She told us:“Rapid and disruptive innovation is inherently risky. You don’t get to the moon without blowing up a few rockets and we won’t get to secure, large-scale smart contracts without blowing up a few DAOs. The same basic mantra of business applies here too — fail fast, fail cheap. The DAO achieved the former.”“Writing smart contracts that control funds securely is difficult. Over time, the security-critical components will mature through many iterations and many losses. Even though the Ethereum platform is past its beta, every new smart contract and component should be treated as pre-alpha software.”“Smart contracts need to mature and the Ethereum platform doesn’t magically make them robust. Both the platform and the contracts will mature through iteration together. The funds controlled by smart contracts should be proportional to their degree of maturity and testing.”“Too much money was invested too quickly in an immature and overly complex contract. Complexity is the enemy of security. The flexibility introduced by a Turing complete, high-level smart contract language brings with it unintended consequences, such as the reentrancy bug that was introduced in the DAO contract.”Bitfinex: One for the BooksThe August hack of Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange Bitfinex, one of the top bitcoin traders globally, to the tune of roughly $70 million, sent a chill through the digital currency world and shook any complacency around the security of bitcoin exchanges.Some experts have tied the hack to a shaky bitcoin price and wonder if it will take a while to restore confidence; others believe that Bitcoin’s security has been affirmed since Bitfinex was able to avoid a shutdown and Bitcoin's blockchain retained its security and functionality in spite of the hack.In his response to the Bitfinex attack, Stefan Thomas, one of the original Bitcoin developers and Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer said, “There’s no history of how to write secure code. It is not surprising that it would be easy to miss typical problems.”Morgan commented:“The architecture of a bitcoin service provider, such as an exchange, holding funds for tens of thousands of users is inherently flawed. Re-centralizing data, in this case bitcoin keys, is the opposite of the decentralized architecture of Bitcoin itself.”“Multisignature technology has been widely misunderstood as a security “fix” but multisig is simply a tool. Two entities controlling the keys and funds of 100,000 users is a bit better than one entity, but not as good as 100,000 points of control.”“No one knows how to secure large concentrations of data. The data breaches of companies like Yahoo, Target, Best Buy and even the NSA demonstrate this point. The very same issues of scale apply to bitcoin data. The difference between a bitcoin theft and identity theft is that bitcoin users feel the sting immediately.”Staying One Step Ahead of the Hack with Formal Verification“Formal verification” is the new buzzword in the security business. Morgan thinks it is likely that eventually, “most smart contracts will incorporate formally verified components to build a strong foundation, and use more flexible coding practices for the rest of their contracts.”“Formal verification is an interesting methodology that rebalances the tradeoff between flexibility and security,” she added. “Many programmers will find it difficult to write code that can be formally verified; but for core services, such as deciding who owns a contract and who controls funds (authentication, authorization, policy) formal verification could deliver much more secure code.”“Decentralized Consensus is the Innovation that Matters.”A number of developers have argued  that the security flaw in blockchain technology is its requirement to achieve distributed consensus on new security measures.Updates to software in blockchain are inhibited because a majority who run the software must agree to the rollout.However, Morgan takes a different view:“We already have systems that are centralized, controllable and can be censored — like Ripple. They are not novel. They are not disruptive. They are business-as-usual with the word “blockchain” painted on as a thin veneer of innovation. Decentralized consensus is the innovation that matters.”“Overall, I attribute the hacks in our industry as symptoms of growing pains in a fast moving space. Certainly some are caused by sloppiness, bad actors, and the re-introduction of centralization, but I believe most of it is simple human error in the face of unexplored territory and complexity. We simply don’t understand all the risks and there’s only one way to learn — real money, real risk, real people.”“Eventually security functions smart contracts will be built by combining battle-hardened and mature modules for common functionality — much like cryptographic libraries and random number generators, people will not write their own. Until then, we try, we test, we fail and we try again. As these systems iterate and mature, they become more and more secure, more useful, and therefore more valuable.”Bitcoin right now is not really anonymous. Monitoring the unencrypted peer-to-peer network, analyzing the public blockchain or Know Your Customer (KYC) policies and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations can reveal a lot about who is using Bitcoin and for what.This is not great from a privacy perspective. For example, Bitcoin users might not necessarily want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own; similarly, businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors.Additionally, the fact that the transaction history of each bitcoin is traceable puts the fungibility of all bitcoins at risk. “Tainted” bitcoins may be valued less than other bitcoins, possibly even calling into question Bitcoin's value proposition as money.But privacy and fungibility can be improved. An older method to break a link of transactions — CoinSwap — was recently revived and improved upon, with promising results. TumbleBit, as the new solution is called, is set to realize a completely private and trustless mixing service — and even offers increased scalability as a bonus.CoinSwapA key problem for privacy and fungibility is that Bitcoin-addresses are trivially linkable. If Alice pays Bob a bitcoin, blockchain analysis reveals that their addresses did the transaction.To break this link, Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell proposed CoinSwap, first introduced on the Bitcointalk forum in 2013.The idea behind CoinSwap is very simple: it uses an intermediary for payment. If Alice pays one bitcoin to an intermediary, and this intermediary pays a different bitcoin to Bob, Alice will have effectively paid one bitcoin to Bob, but no link exists between their addresses on the blockchain.The problem is that this intermediary can steal funds. If Alice pays the intermediary a bitcoin, the intermediary can simply decide not to pay Bob, and instead keep the bitcoin.This is solved with Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs). Alice and the intermediary set up a special type of payment channel, while Bob and the intermediary set up a payment channel as well. Through clever Bitcoin tricks that include embedding dedicated cryptographic keys in transactions, these payment channels are effectively linked. Bob can claim one bitcoin from the payment channel between him and the intermediary, but only in such a way that the intermediary can also claim a bitcoin from the payment channel between him and Alice. No one can steal funds.(The specifics of HTLC is beyond the scope of this article; for more details see ‘Understanding the Lightning Network, Part 2: Creating the Network’.)CoinSwap breaks the link of transactions on the blockchain. But, unfortunately, that doesn’t solve all privacy and fungibility issues just yet. Most importantly, the intermediary still knows that Alice transacted with Bob. The intermediary can re-establish the link.These issues are what the new TumbleBit improvement solves.TumbleBitTumbleBit was proposed by Boston University’s Ethan Heilman, Leen Alshenibr, Foteini Baldimtsi, Alessandra Scafuro and Sharon Goldberg last summer, and was recently presented at the Scaling Bitcoin workshops in Milan.TumbleBit resembles CoinSwap, but adds three important features.First, it adds anonymity in numbers. TumbleBit allows many users —  many “Alices” and many “Bobs” —  to set up payment channels with the same intermediary. And all Alices can send bitcoins to all Bobs through that intermediary.Second, the payment channels between the intermediary and all Bobs are replaced by sophisticated cryptographic puzzles. If Bob can provide the solution to the puzzles, he can claim —  say — a bitcoin. The trick is that Alice buys the answers for these puzzles from the intermediary for a bitcoin. She then sends the answer to Bob as payment, which Bob will happily accept since he can claim a bitcoin with it.And importantly: all this is done through several layers of cryptography. This ensures that the intermediary does not know which solution he sold to which Alice, nor do the Alices know which puzzle solution they gave to Bob. As such, once the Bobs claim their bitcoins, the intermediary sees that puzzles are solved. But due to the anonimity in numbers, the intermediary cannot link any of the Alices to any of the Bobs.And third, the Alices and Bobs can fund their payment channels with the intermediary such that they can make several payments. And again, any Alice can pay any Bob; it doesn’t need to be the same Bob each time. This makes the intermediary a useful payment hub.Furthermore, these puzzle-solving transactions between all Alices, the intermediary, and all Bobs, never hit the blockchain. Rather, once everyone is done transacting, the end-state of all payment channels is recorded on the blockchain once, to let everyone take their funds out. TumbleBit is a scalable second-layer payment hub on top of a privacy-friendly solution.RealityLast but not least: TumbleBit can be realized without requiring any changes to the Bitcoin protocol.The team from Boston University has already coded a proof of concept and run successful tests on the blockchain. While the software is not quite ready for production use yet, it is open source and free for anyone to use and contribute to.Furthermore, TumbleBit really only requires a single party to establish the service. In fact, it would be better if only one (or very few) parties offer it: if everyone uses the same TumbleBit service, that one service offers great anonymity in numbers. (Since it’s completely trustless, centralization is not an issue.)And since fees are trivially implemented in the design, moreover, there is even an incentive to establish a TumbleBit server. It seems it’s only a matter of time before someone realizes this potential.Bitcoin right now is not really anonymous. Monitoring of the unencrypted peer-to-peer network and analysis of the public blockchain, combined with Know Your Customer (KYC) policies and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulation, can reveal a lot about who is using Bitcoin and for what.This is not great from a privacy perspective. For example, Bitcoin users might not necessarily want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own; similarly, businesses may not want to leak transaction details to competitors.And the fact that the transaction history of each bitcoin is traceable puts the fungibility of all bitcoins at risk. “Tainted” bitcoins may be valued less than other bitcoins, possibly even calling into question bitcoin's value proposition as money.But this can be improved. Perhaps one of the most promising solutions is designed to be an integral part of one of Bitcoin’s highly anticipated scaling layers: the lightning network. Utilizing the “Sphinx” protocol, lightning payments will be routed over a Tor-like anonymity network to offer privacy and protect fungibility.Payment Channels and the Lightning Network: A Brief RecapThe lightning network essentially consists of bi-directional payment channels, creating a peer-to-peer network.Bi-directional payment channels increase privacy even without the lightning network. Two users — let’s say Alice and Bob — can open a bi-directional payment channel and transact over this channel through a private medium. Only once they are finished transacting will they broadcast the final state of the channel to the blockchain. This public transaction reveals how much money Alice sent to Bob — or the other way around. But there is no way to tell whether this was through ten transactions, a hundred small transactions, or maybe even a thousand transactions back and forth. This ambiguity is a boon for privacy.Unfortunately, a disadvantage is introduced when these bi-directional payment channels are all linked to create a peer-to-peer network. If Alice pays a third user — Carol — through Bob, Bob will know that Alice paid Carol, and how much. While Alice and Carol still have relative privacy in relation to the rest of the world, they do not have privacy in relation to Bob. And if there are two or more intermediaries —  not only Bob but also Dan — both Bob and Dan learn about the transaction between Alice and Carol.Not ideal.SphinxThe current lightning network specification includes a solution to mask routing data from all intermediaries, based on Sphinx.Designed by academic researchers, George Danezis and Ian Goldberg, Sphinx is a protocol to relay anonymized messages over a peer-to-peer network. The solution was first proposed in May 2009, and had nothing to do with the lightning network or even Bitcoin. It was Lightning Labs’ Olaoluwa Osuntokun who realized Sphinx could be utilized and, in collaboration with Blockstream’s Christian Decker, modified the protocol to better fit the lightning network.Sphinx shares similarities with the well-known anonymizing communication tool, Tor (the Onion Router). As with Tor, any data package sent with Sphinx — including the receiving IP address – is encrypted. This encrypted package is then itself encrypted a couple times over until it consists of several “layers” of encryption (hence the “onion” metaphor for Tor).Using clever cryptographic tricks, all these layers of encryption are applied so that each intermediary along a route toward the final destination of the package can unwrap only one layer. This layer reveals to each intermediary where the package must be forwarded to, but nothing else. (Compared to Tor, Sphinx uses improved cryptographic algorithms and creates a constant-size data package to better obfuscate a node’s position in the route.)On lightning, the payer determines a path over the peer-to-peer network and wraps a payment package in layers of encryption. And, apart from just relay information, each intermediary also unpacks some additional data. This includes amounts, fees and more, along with allowing all intermediaries to set up a step in the payment chain. (In a future version of the lightning network, this may be extended with a protocol called “Hornet” to further streamline the whole process — but this is not strictly needed for the lightning network to function.)Importantly, all intermediaries only learn from which channel they receive bitcoins, and to which channel they must forward the payment. The intermediaries have no idea whether they are the first step in the chain, the last step, a step somewhere in the middle, or perhaps even the only step. Whoever originally sent the transaction, and the one who ultimately receives it, remain known to only the sender and the receiver.Whenever channels close, the advantages offered by bi-directional payments channels are clear — on steroids. While everyone gets to see how many bitcoins Alice sent to Bob over the duration of the channel, again, it remains unknown whether these were ten transactions, a hundred small transactions, or maybe even a thousand transactions back and forth. Moreover, Alice may not even have sent much of the money to Bob at all: perhaps most payments from Alice to Bob were actually routed to Carol, or to someone else, anywhere on the network.While Silk Road popularized the industry back in 2011, AlphaBay is the now the most widely used darknet market in existence. Usage statistics are hard to come by when it comes to Tor hidden services, but in an interview with Deep Dot Web earlier this year, the site’s head administrator claimed many vendors from the now-defunct Evolution marketplace have moved over to AlphaBay.The popularity of AlphaBay is also obvious on the darknet markets subreddit, a popular forum of choice for those who shop on the darknet.Bitcoin Magazine reached out to AlphaBay to get their thoughts on Bitcoin scaling and two privacy-focused altcoins: Monero and Zcash.On Bitcoin CongestionMany Bitcoin-related companies have had to deal with an increase in support tickets due to the increased congestion on the network this past year, and AlphaBay has not been spared this headache. “It has become an issue when there is [a] backlog on the blockchain, as many newbie users complain about missing deposits while they are in fact unconfirmed,” a member of the AlphaBay support team told Bitcoin Magazine.Although various improvements to privacy and scalability were discussed at a Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Milan this past October, AlphaBay does not currently have any plans to run a Tumblebit hub or a Lightning Network node. “We have our own proprietary tumbling platform,” said the support representative.It should be noted that the code for these projects are still works in progress. While the upcoming social media app Yours has implemented their own micropayments solution, a more elegant version of the Lightning Network will be possible if or when Segregated Witness is activated on the network. Tumblebit does not require any changes to the Bitcoin protocol, although it would be improved by Segregated Witness. At least two implementations are currently in development.Are AlphaBay Users Paying with Monero?After AlphaBay and Oasis (another darknet market) integrated Monero payments in late August, the market cap of Monero grew from around $25 million to over $170 million in a couple of weeks. The market cap has now settled around $110 million.While Oasis appears to have pulled an exit scam (they ran away with users’ money) since their Monero announcement, AlphaBay is still alive and kicking. An AlphaBay support representative told Bitcoin Magazine that Monero accounts for 2 percent of AlphaBay’s business.According to MoneroStats, there were less than 500 transactions per day on the Monero network before the darknet markets took an interest in the Bitcoin alternative. Now, there is usually three times that amount. It’s unclear how much of that transaction growth is due to real usage and how much is an increased number of speculators moving their coins between exchanges.Zcash Worth ConsiderationZcash has launched since AlphaBay adopted Monero, and many are wondering if this could be the next altcoin tested out by the darknet markets. The Zcash market cap is currently less than a tenth of Monero’s.When asked whether AlphaBay will adopt Zcash, a support representative told Bitcoin Magazine, “In the future we might. It looks like a good alternative.”In the quest for privacy and fungibility in Bitcoin, two researchers (from Saarland University in Saarbrücken, Germany and Indiana’s Purdue University) presented a promising privacy enhancement proposal last week. ValueShuffle, as the protocol is called, describes a method to mix bitcoins and at the same time hide the amounts involved in the mixing process.It’s a potent combination, as Tim Ruffing, one of the researchers, explained:“The combination of these two privacy-enhancing technologies, while not requiring any trusted third party, is what makes ValueShuffle unique.”CoinJoin and CoinShuffleRuffing wrote the ValueShuffle draft white paper with Pedro Moreno-Sanchez; these are the same two researchers who previously proposed the CoinShuffle protocols, along with their PhD advisor, Aniket Kate, then at Saarland University.Leveraging CoinJoin, first proposed by Bitcoin Core and Blockstream developer, Gregory Maxwell, CoinShuffle is a method to merge several transactions into one, with no need for a trusted party. As such, a single Bitcoin transaction can send bitcoins from many people to many people. This potentially obfuscates the trail of coins, as it’s no longer clear exactly who paid whom.The obfuscation is only potential, however, because the amount of coins involved in a transaction can be a giveaway. If one transaction sends five bitcoins from address to address, and another transaction sends seven bitcoins from address to address, merging these into one transaction would not obfuscate much. Simply matching the amounts reveals who sent bitcoins to whom.“With our initial CoinShuffle proposals, this can be solved if everyone uses the same amounts,” Ruffing explained. “If everyone involved in the mix sends exactly one bitcoin, the sending and receiving addresses can no longer be matched. But this is also quite a limiting factor. Any remaining coins must go to some change address without being anonymized, which is cumbersome, and may even break privacy if not used properly. And for technical reasons it also means you cannot use CoinShuffle to make a payment directly; you can only send bitcoins back to yourself.”Confidential TransactionsWith ValueShuffle, the problem of matching amounts is solved by hiding the amounts involved in a transaction.This is accomplished using another proposal designed to increase privacy in Bitcoin: Confidential Transactions. Developed by Blockstream, Confidential Transactions is currently implemented in Blockstream’s Elements Alpha sidechain, which is active on Bitcoin’s testnet.Using clever cryptography, Confidential Transactions ensures that no one can see how many bitcoins are involved in a transaction, nor how many were sent from which address to which address. Nodes can, however, verify that the total number of bitcoins sent matches the total number of bitcoins received. As such, they can be sure no bitcoins were created out of thin air.The combination of CoinJoin and Confidential Transactions has long been considered a powerful solution. As CoinJoin obfuscates which addresses sent bitcoins to which addresses, Confidential Transactions obfuscates the amounts, to break all links. With ValueShuffle, all this can be done without requiring a trusted party to merge the different transactions into one.“Plus, it allows users to make payments directly through ValueShuffle, rather than having to send themselves mixed bitcoins first,” Ruffing said.Segregated WitnessThus far, however, the Confidential Transactions building block is not part of the Bitcoin protocol.“But it may be in the future,” Ruffing said. “It can be rolled out with a backward compatible soft fork, which would be even easier if Segregated Witness is activated first. On top of that, ValueShuffle could benefit from Segregated Witness in other ways. Since Confidential Transactions are relatively expensive compared to normal transactions, the witness “discount” will help. And if Schnorr signature aggregation is deployed through Segregated Witness as well, that would be another boon for efficiency.”If Confidential Transactions does become part of the Bitcoin protocol — either through Segregated Witness or as an independent soft or hard fork — not much stands in the way of ValueShuffle. The solution would not require additional protocol changes; it would just require wallets to implement the solution. And, ideally, a server to host the mixing protocol.“Technically, it can be done without a central server, but it wouldn’t be very practical. And keep in mind that a central server wouldn’t need to be trusted with users’ private keys or privacy, and they’re easily replaced if something goes wrong.” Ruffing said. “As for wallets, Mycelium has already implemented a version of CoinShuffle. And ValueShuffle is even easier to implement, because it’s based on the simpler and more efficient CoinShuffle++ protocol.”It appears the United States Postal Service is determined not to be the courier of choice for drug dealers any longer.Judging by a recent job listing sent to the information security community, the United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) — the law enforcement arm of the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) — wants to sniff out users of darknet markets that send their packages by mail. Applicants for the job, listed as “Investigative (Internet) Analyst”, are expected to know their way around bitcoin — the currency of choice on the darkweb — a as well as other tools typically used by darknets, like Tor.Although the job listing doesn’t appear to be published online any more, according to Deep Dot Web the USPIS is specifically looking for applicants able to unmask pseudonymous users of dark net markets:“Candidates shall be capable of performing a prioritized assessment of the data to identify the most critical and reliable data in order to identify bitcoins, locations, accounts, services, travels, email addresses, IP addresses and other pattern of life data in an effort to determine physical attribution of an Internet identity.”And, according to Motherboard:“The analyst shall be capable to use technology solutions to actively search, analyze and prioritize the various market places and cyber-criminals to identify high value targets for the USPIS investigators.”Darknet Going ForwardDarknet markets are eBay-like market places that operate on darknets such as Tor and I2P, most commonly operating as digital black markets. The vast majority of purchases are illegal drugs, but weapons, stolen credit card details and other illegal goods are traded as well. Since pioneering darknet market Silk Road was closed down in 2013, and founder Ross Ulbricht sentenced to life in prison, buying and selling of illegal contraband has only increased.Shipment of the illegal goods is exclusively done by mail. In most cases, at least in the United Stated, this is done with USPS. As a federal agency, USPS is bound by the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution. This prevents the postal service from inspecting packages without a warrant, attaining which in turn requires probable cause. Providing this probable cause is — presumably — where the investigative analyst would come in.That said, even now, the mailing system is probably the weakest link in darknet market operations. Where online communication is protected with encryption and Tor, and bitcoin (or monero) payments can be mixed and tumbled, packages still require physical addresses — and can be intercepted.Indeed, the USPIS does already regularly provide assistance in darknet investigations. Perhaps most notably,  the USPIS is said to have played an active role November 2016's \"Operation Hyperion,” one of the most extensive police operations focused on the darknet to date, where thousands of users of these marketplaces were identified.The job listing suggests the USPIS will ramp of these and similar efforts in the future.Some of the most popular Bitcoin services on the internet may have leaked sensitive user information, including passwords.Cloudflare is a popular content delivery network that effectively acts as a sort of digital shield, a proxy that offers millions of websites DoS protection and other services. Some of the biggest websites on the internet use Cloudflare, including several well-known Bitcoin companies, like Coinbase, Kraken, LocalBitcoins, Poloniex and moreAny data sent to and from these websites essentially passes through Cloudflare. This includes passwords, as well as cookies, authentication tokens and other sensitive information.Last week, an exploit now known as “Cloudbleed” — a reference to the Heartbleed security bug — was discovered by Google Project Zero security researcher Tavis Ormandy. A major flaw in Cloudflare’s infrastructure, caused by what is known as a “buffer overflow,” basically spilled data all across the internet. Whenever anyone requested data from a particular website or mobile app protected by Cloudflare, Cloudflare could randomly send data from completely different websites along with it.“We fetched a few live samples, and we observed encryption keys, cookies, passwords, chunks of POST data and even HTTPS requests for other major Cloudflare-hosted sites from other users,” Ormandy wrote in his blog entry.The vulnerability is significant in scope as well as length. It could have been exploited anytime between September 22 and February 20, while the period of greatest impact was between February 13 and 18. And as a potentially bigger concern, some search engines may have even cached the sensitive data as well, meaning it’s publicly available to anyone.The good news is that the odds of sensitive data falling into the wrong hands so far seems relatively small. “We have also not discovered any evidence of malicious exploits of the bug or other reports of its existence,” Cloudflare itself wrote in their incident report.However, the bad news is that there is no way of knowing exactly what data may have leaked. Users of services that may have been impacted, therefore, should assume their data is no longer secure and change their passwords immediately. (This of course also includes passwords on non-Cloudflare websites that have been used across multiple sites.)It seems less likely that accounts protected with two-factor authentication are vulnerable, though it may depend on the specific implementation; resetting it is still advisable. Those that use API keys should be reset too.Cloudflare has since patched the bug, and some search engines (like Google) are removing any such data from their caches that they can find.TumbleBit, one of the most promising privacy advancements built on top of Bitcoin, will be implemented in the upcoming Breeze Wallet.The Breeze Wallet is a bitcoin wallet in development by blockchain startup Stratis, scheduled for release in one or two months. It will serve as a typical bitcoin wallet for desktop computers, but with an added tumbling option. Connected through a TumbleBit tumbler, Breeze Wallet users can mix their coins without needing to trust each other or the tumbler with their coins or their privacy.“We are integrating TumbleBit because it’s a trustless and secure solution that works with Bitcoin without any forks,” Stratis Founder and CEO Chris Trew told Bitcoin Magazine.StratisStratis is a U.K.-based startup that offers end-to-end solutions for development, testing and deployment of blockchain applications. The company will maintain its own blockchain (the Stratis blockchain), which includes a native token (the Stratis token). Additionally, the company builds tools for existing blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum and BitShares. Stratis projects include a Bitcoin full node in the programming language C#, a Bitcoin software development kit and, indeed, the Breeze wallet, which will hold both bitcoins and the Stratis tokens.TumbleBit was first proposed by academic researchers Ethan Heilman, Leen AlShenibr, Foteini Baldimtsi, Alessandra Scafuro and Sharon Goldberg. Inspired by its potential, “Programming The Blockchain in C#” author and Stratis team member Nicolas Dorier started working on an implementation of TumbleBit in C#. He was joined by the co-author of his book, Ficsór Ádám, who focused on Tor integration.Now, with the help of Ádám, Stratis is making the solution available in a convenient and easy-to-use wallet. It is a natural match not only because Stratis’s and Dorier’s implementations of TumbleBit share the same programming language, but also because Stratis has a strong focus on privacy on their own platform, Trew explained.“Regulation is one of the main hurdles for blockchain [technology] and Bitcoin adoption among the financial services industry,” he said. “The first step of regulatory compliance is privacy of their sensitive financial data. This is one of the reasons for the rise of the private chain and distributed ledger technologies. Our goal is to provide open and public blockchain solutions for the enterprise; to deliver this we must provide transaction privacy on a public blockchain.”ChallengesTo realize the privacy features it promises, Breeze Wallet will also introduce a relatively new type of light client. Based on work by Bitcoin Core developer Jonas Schnelli, the wallet will utilize “Full Block Simplified Payment Verification,” or “Full Block SPV.”Full nodes download and verify each block on the blockchain, which can be quite resource intensive. Most light clients therefore only download the specific data that’s relevant to them: mostly relating to their Bitcoin addresses. But to do this, they need to share all their addresses with a server or a node on the Bitcoin network.This server or node — and anyone spying on the communication with this server or node — learns all addresses that are in the wallet. This makes tumbling coins from one address in a wallet to another address in the same wallet rather pointless.Instead, Ádám is currently implementing a type of light client that will download full blocks but immediately discard any data it doesn’t need. This requires the wallet to download more data than typical light clients, which is why Breeze Wallet won’t be very suitable for mobile wallets anytime soon. But it will be less resource intensive than running a full node and, therefore, easier to use for regular users.Lastly, one hurdle remains: someone, somewhere, needs to host the tumbler. While this can be done as a hidden service, the TumbleBit developers have been hesitant to do this themselves so far. Such a service may not exactly please regulators and anti-money laundering agencies.Stratis is now working through the legal and regulatory issues involved with deploying a solution of this type. “The ultimate goal is to have a decentralized network of TumbleBit servers. We are working on delivering end-to-end solutions; then we will further develop some of the core components,” Trew said.For more on TumbleBit, read “With TumbleBit, Bitcoin Mixing May Have Found Its Winning Answer” and “Better Bitcoin Privacy, Scalability: Developers Making TumbleBit a Reality.”For over a year, attackers have had the ability to crash Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic nodes. Yesterday, someone actually did it. According to websites like Coin Dance, the number of Bitcoin Unlimited nodes fell sharply from almost 800 to less than 250 in a matter of hours. Bitcoin Classic was hit shortly after.One day earlier, the security researcher who found the vulnerability had reached out to Bitcoin Magazine.“I am quite beside myself at how a project that aims to power a $20 billion network can make beginner’s mistakes like this.”The VulnerabilitiesBitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic are forks of Bitcoin Core that intend to increase Bitcoin’s block size limit. Both launched in 2015 and have been maintained by their own development teams since. While Bitcoin Classic was a relatively popular alternative to Bitcoin Core last year, Bitcoin Unlimited has been gaining traction lately. The world’s largest mining pool — AntPool — announced it would switch to Bitcoin Unlimited, as have several smaller pools.But not everyone believes that is a good idea.“I am rather dismayed at the poor level of code quality in Bitcoin Unlimited and I suspect there [is] a raft of other issues,” a security researcher identifying herself only as “Charlotte Gardner” told Bitcoin Magazine on Monday.Communicating over email, Gardner said she was auditing the software for her own use, but quickly came to the conclusion that it’s highly unsafe: “What concerns me is that this software is now being used by a huge portion of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem.”Gardner revealed that she had submitted two vulnerabilities — “critical remote crash vulnerabilities” to be exact — to the Bitcoin Unlimited development team.The first one is known as a “NULL pointer dereference,” the second a “reachable assertion.” In both cases, attackers can send especially crafted messages to Bitcoin Unlimited or Bitcoin Classic nodes to make these nodes crash. On an open peer-to-peer network like Bitcoin’s, this means that an attacker can get a list of Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic nodes from publicly available sources, like Bitnodes, and simply knock every single one of them offline.“I’m surprised no one has noticed them yet,” Gardner told Bitcoin Magazine one day before the attack took place. “I guess not many people actually use the Bitcoin Unlimited software. But with their ‘rise,’ attackers may take more interest.”The DisclosureWhen contacting Bitcoin Magazine on Monday, Gardner did not immediately want to make the vulnerabilities public. That would have been irresponsible, she explained, as the bugs could still be exploited before the Bitcoin Unlimited development team had the chance to fix it.But she did also submit the vulnerabilities to Mitre’s Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. This ensures that Mitre discloses the bugs in one month from now, which pressures the developers to actually fix the problem in time.However, even following this responsible disclosure, Gardner thought there was a risk that the vulnerabilities would be abused as soon as they were fixed in the Bitcoin Unlimited code repository. After all, at that point the problem isn’t really solved: anyone running the released Bitcoin Unlimited software is still vulnerable until they download and run the new, revised version. This opens a window for attackers.“The problem is, the bugs are so glaringly obvious that when fixing it, it will be easy to notice for anyone watching their development process,” she said.It now appears that is exactly what has happened. While the Bitcoin Unlimited developers did indeed fix the issue shortly after it was pointed out to them, they did so with far too conspicuous a GitHub commit message, Gardner told Bitcoin Magazine once it appeared the bugs seemed fixed and before the attacks began.“Their commit message does ring alarm bells. I’m not sure if anyone will notice, but they probably should have obfuscated the message a bit more. The wording might attract closer scrutiny. But if it went unnoticed for this long, maybe it will go unnoticed.”Clearly, it did not.As Gardner warned, it didn’t take long for attackers to exploit one of the vulnerabilities: the first attacks happened shortly after the bugs were fixed. A little later, user “shinobimonkey” took the issue to Reddit, Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd tweeted about the bug and social media blew up.Someone then even published exploit code for anyone to use, and before long most Bitcoin Unlimited nodes were down, to be followed by many Bitcoin Classic nodes.“This is exactly why there is supposed to be a ‘responsible disclosure’ protocol,” Gardner told Bitcoin Magazine after the attacks took place. “But then it doesn’t help if the software project is not discreet about fixing critical issues like this.”Code QualityThis is not the first time the code quality of Bitcoin Unlimited or Bitcoin Classic has been scrutinized.As the best-known example, the bitcoin.com mining pool, which runs Bitcoin Unlimited, mined an invalid block caused by a bug last January. All energy invested to produce the block was wasted, while mining pools that spy mined on top of the invalid block wasted some energy as well.Before that, Bitcoin Core developers had already warned about buggy code on several occasions. On the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Matt Corallo said that he had found Bitcoin Classic’s flexible transactions codebase to be “riddled with blatant and massive security holes.” On Reddit, Gregory Maxwell pointed out that Bitcoin Unlimited nodes were crashing because the development team removed code that shouldn’t have been removed.Addressing Bitcoin Unlimited lead developer Andrew Stone in response to yesterday’s events, Maxwell suggested there are more problems with Bitcoin Unlimited’s codebase that have not yet been abused:“There are vulnerabilities in Unlimited which have been privately reported to you in Unlimited by Bitcoin Core folks which you have not acted on, sadly. More severe than this one, in fact.”Perhaps the main problem for Bitcoin Unlimited, as pointed out by information security expert Andreas Antonopoulos, is that it lacks a significant development community to perform proper quality analysis. The number of developers working on Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic is relatively small, and the code that included the exploited vulnerability was merged after being reviewed by only one person — not a lot for security-critical code protecting people’s money.Gardner agreed with this assessment:“In this case, the vulnerabilities are so glaringly obvious, it is clear no one has audited their code because these stick out like a sore thumb,” she said. “I’m astounded the mining industry are running this software. But since they are, and a lot of people could get harmed, the best I can do, other than recommending they don’t use Bitcoin Unlimited, is to disclose the issues and hope they are competent enough to fix it.”Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Bitcoin Unlimited developers Andrew Stone and Andrea Suisani, but received no response at time of publication.There is a chance Bitcoin will experience a coin-split soon. If a majority of miners (by hash power) switch to Bitcoin Unlimited and decide to mine blocks bigger than one megabyte, while at least some users stick to the current Bitcoin protocol, the network and blockchain can split in two. In that case, there may be two different types of Bitcoin tokens: “BTC,” which follows the current Bitcoin protocol, and “BTU,” which follows the new Bitcoin Unlimited protocol.The good news is that each bitcoin would effectively be copied onto the Bitcoin Unlimited chain. If you hold bitcoin right now, you will hold both BTC and BTU after a split.The bad news is that a coin-split can be messy and risky. This is mainly because, at first, all BTCs and all BTUs will be stuck together. You will need to separate them somehow; otherwise you can lose your BTC or your BTU.This guide will provide you with the basics to stay safe during a coin-split, and make sure you make it to the “other side” with both your BTC and BTU intact.Author’s note: If you want to play the BTC/BTU markets as soon as possible and you are fine with taking risks, and/or you really know what you are doing, this article is probably not for you. (Perhaps try this Electrum article instead.)If you mostly just want to make sure not to lose your BTC or BTU, read on …Before the Coin-Split (That’s Now)First of all, be aware that a coin-split is a high-risk situation. There is a real chance a sort of cyber-battle will break out between the two camps, perhaps even escalating to the point where bitcoin’s exchange rate(s) drops sharply, possibly to zero. Make absolutely sure you are not holding more value in bitcoin than what you are willing to lose.If you do decide to hold on to your bitcoins, the single most important piece of advice is this: control your own private keys.If you are storing your bitcoins on an exchange, in a custodial wallet like Coinbase, Circle or Xapo, or on any other service that holds your private keys for you, you may or may not eventually receive coins on both ends of the chain. Several exchanges have so far suggested you may but have made no guarantees. And at least one exchange, GDAX, has explicitly indicated you may not.Learn more about bitcoin wallets here. If you’re using any of these kinds of services to store your bitcoins, you need to create your own wallet. Send your bitcoins to this new wallet; this wallet now holds your private keys.What kind of wallet you want to use is up to you. That said, here are some basic solutions:If you don’t care about transacting with either BTC or BTU anytime soon, and really just want to keep both as a long-term investment, printing your private keys on a paper wallet is one option. This option, however, is only really secure if you follow strict security precautions, which you can find here.Another option is to get a hardware wallet. Any of the hardware wallets listed on bitcoin.org will keep your private keys secure. One hardware wallet provider in particular, Trezor, has explicitly acknowledged that users will have access to their coins on both ends of the chain if a coin-split happens..Therefore, in terms of the security of your coins, a little has changed — no action is required from you & your coins remain safe. You will not magically lose coins because of a fork.” Trezor blog post, March 20]Regular wallets are about as secure as your computer (or phone) is. Since most computers and phones are not all that secure, these are not ideal for large amounts. With that in mind, all mobile wallets and desktop wallets listed on bitcoin.org will store your private keys for you. Additionally, a full node like Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots gives you a little extra security during a coin-split, as you’ll see below.During the Coin-SplitThe first thing to note is that Bitcoin Unlimited has not set a \"flag date\" to fork. This means that theoretically, a fork could happen at any time. Realistically, however, it will depend on miner coordination, and it will probably be obvious to even casual Bitcoin observers when a fork is close to happening.If Bitcoin Unlimited does fork, things could get messy for anywhere between a couple of hours to a couple of days, or longer.Unfortunately, Bitcoin Unlimited currently does not include “replay protection.” This means that post-fork, transactions on both sides of the fork will look identical. If a transaction is picked up by both networks — for example, because the receiver of a transaction re-transmits the transaction on the other network — that transaction may be valid on both chains. This is called a “replay attack.”As such, spending coins on one end of the chain could make you accidentally spend the equivalent coin on the other side of the chain. Instead of paying someone only BTC, you may unintentionally send BTU as well — or vice versa. This is how the BTCs and BTUs are “stuck together.”The best way to prevent replay attacks is simple: do not send any transactions. Not until it is clearer to everyone what the post-fork situation looks like.If you use Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots as a wallet and you want to accept BTC, that should still be fine. (Someone who didn’t read this article may accidentally send you the equivalent in BTU, though. If this happens, you should probably return the funds later on.)Bitcoin Unlimited, on the other hand, does not include “wipeout protection.” If the amount of mining power on the BTC chain ever overtakes the BTU chain, the entire BTU chain will be discarded (unless users on the BTU chain coordinate fast enough to prevent this in unconventional ways).Unless and until it is absolutely clear that Bitcoin Unlimited emerges as a definitive winner forever, accepting any BTU is very risky, and you probably shouldn’t do it at all. After the Coin-SplitIf both chains survive, and you control your private keys, you will have coins on both sides of the fork. But as mentioned, it will be tricky to spend coins on one chain without accidentally spending the equivalent on the other side.Fortunately, there are ways to avoid these replay attacks. The most straightforward solution requires brand-new coins, mined after the split. These new coins are the only coins that do not exist on both chains and cannot, therefore, be spent on both. Combining these new coins with old coins effectively splits the BTC from BTU.This coin-splitting can, and probably will, be a bit complex. But some exchanges will likely set up coin-splitting services and take care of most of the complexity behind the screens. You’d just need to send your bitcoins to an exchange, and the exchange will credit your account with BTC and BTU. (They should even replay the transaction for you, to make sure they indeed receive both your coins and can split them for you.) If you want, you can now also sell your BTU for BTC (or fiat currency), or the other way round.There may also be other solutions to split your coins in the event of a coin-split, perhaps even trustless solutions. But that remains to be seen.After the split, there will probably be wallets for both coins soon enough. Of course, you may need to upgrade your existing wallet or download a new wallet if and when this happens. This also remains to be seen. (Do not accept any transactions on your wallet before this is clear.)Further specifics on what to do after a coin-split will be announced on Bitcoin Magazine (and most likely on bitcoin.org and other sources of information) if and when a coin-split occurs and we have a better understanding of the post-fork situation.Oh, and when you, years from now, want to use the funds stored on your paper wallet, don’t forget you now own both BTC and BTU! (Wallets like Electrum and Blockchain allow you to upload the private keys, and you’ll probably need to go through the same splitting ceremony.)If only one chain survives, operations should continue at some point. However, it’s not exactly clear what this post-fork landscape will look like. Perhaps you’ll have to upgrade your wallet. This will also be announced on Bitcoin Magazine if and when it comes to it.If neither chain survives, the Bitcoin experiment has failed, and your private keys will probably be worthless.On a typical blockchain, all participants check all transactions. This level of transparency can offer much security, as public verification ensures no single participant can cheat any of the others. But it is not great for privacy.For bitcoin (the currency), a potential solution to improve privacy is “Confidential Transactions.” Confidential Transactions hide the amounts of bitcoin that are transacted; they are currently used in test environments and in academia.Today, Blockstream — the well-known tech company founded by several Bitcoin Core developers — unveiled “Confidential Assets.” Where Confidential Transactions is specifically designed for bitcoin, Confidential Assets brings a similar level of privacy to any type of blockchain asset, like ownership papers, stock or fiat currency IOUs.“With Confidential Assets, we can generate multi-asset transactions where both the amount and the asset type itself are encrypted,” Blockstream Infrastructure Tech Engineer Gregory Sanders told Bitcoin Magazine.Confidential AssetsConfidential Assets — in itself not an entirely new concept — increases privacy in two ways.The first part of the puzzle is indeed based on Confidential Transactions, which was first proposed by hashcash inventor and current Blockstream CEO Dr. Adam Back. This was further developed by Bitcoin Core and Blockstream developers Gregory Maxwell and Dr. Pieter Wuille, and Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra, and then deployed on Blockstream’s Alpha sidechain.With Confidential Transactions, only the sender and the receiver of a transaction know the amount that is involved in a specific transaction. A public verifier — that’s the rest of the world — knows that a transaction was made between the sender and receiver, but cannot tell how much was transacted: the amount is masked.What’s clever about Confidential Transactions is that the amounts are masked in such a way that public verifiers can still perform certain types of math on them. More specifically, anyone can add up the amounts on the sending end of a transaction, and add up all of the amounts on the receiving end, and see if they cancel out. If they do cancel out, it means no value was created out of thin air. While public verifiers will never know how much was transacted, they do know the system wasn’t cheated; and that’s all they really care about.The second part of the puzzle, which is new, extends a similar type of masking to the assets themselves. Instead of just bitcoins, Confidential Assets can be used for any digital, blockchain-based asset.“While the sender and receiver would know that, say, a gold certificate was transacted, a public verifier would only know that ‘some asset’ was transacted — in ‘some amount,’” Sanders explained.“And if multiple assets are transacted at once, the public verifier would see that multiple types of ‘some assets’ changed hands, and he can verify that no ‘some assets’ were created out of thin air. But he would still not know what was transacted exactly, or how much of each ‘some asset.’”ProjectsConfidential Assets may be deployed on two different projects relatively quickly.For one, it can be combined with Blockstream’s existing sidechain, Liquid. This is a federated blockchain pegged to Bitcoin, where instead of miners, Bitcoin exchanges and other service providers confirm blocks. Compared to proof of work mining, this allows for instant transactions at low cost, without burdening Bitcoin’s main blockchain. Exchanges, in particular, can use this to let customers move bitcoins between accounts at different exchanges without having them wait for blockchain confirmations.With Confidential Assets, this functionality can be extended to the fiat side of the equation, too. Rather than just bitcoins, exchanges and service providers could swap fiat currency instantly and privately, allowing their users to move U.S. dollars, euros or other currencies between accounts as well.And second, Blockstream established a collaboration with Japanese IT company Digital Garage.“Digital Garage is working on a loyalty points blockchain,” Sanders explained. “This means that all types of companies can issue their loyalty points, and customers can use them or trade them atomically for other assets using market makers. […] Privacy is huge here because you do not want to be showing the whole world how many points are outstanding on your books.”Moreover, a Confidential Assets sidechain could realize a trustless, instant and private decentralized exchange.As a simplified example, if Alice has a bitcoin but prefers a gold certificate, while Bob has a gold certificate but prefers a bitcoin, they can create a single CoinJoin transaction to realize the trade. Alice sends a bitcoin to Bob, while Bob sends a gold certificate to Alice; both only sign their end of the transaction if they agree.This basic setup can be extended to intermediaries that act, themselves, as sort of liquidity providers or peer-to-peer exchanges.“For the Digital Garage demo we have implemented a trustless, blinded swap of multiple assets through peers already. If we can deploy fiat currency on the blockchain, we can make similar arrangements between bitcoin and U.S. dollar, euro or yen,” Sanders said.Global consultancy and accounting firm Deloitte announced that it has developed a new KYC-as-a-service solution using blockchain technology that will facilitate the customer onboarding process for financial institutions.The proof of concept has been developed by the team headed up by Director and Blockchain Leader Thibault Chollet in Deloitte’s Luxembourg branch. The name of the new solution is KYCstart (pronounced “kickstart”). KYCstart creates digital identities for new customers that can then be used across different platforms and institutions, thereby making the customer onboarding process much more efficient while also reducing costs.Currently, when a new customer is being onboarded by a financial institution, the process involves an employee of the compliance department electronically filling out KYC (Know Your Customer) forms, which include information such as place of incorporation, ownership structure, whether they are regulated or not, whether they have any legal proceedings against them, and what type of business will be conducted with them.To gather this information, compliance officers will regularly need to reach out to the potential customer via email and phone as well as scroll through the regulator’s database to find any recorded wrongdoings and confirm the regulatory status of the customer.Deloitte’s new proposed model of completing the onboarding process, however, involves regulated KYC added-value service providers, which are authorized to perform KYC checks for customers who would like to be onboarded by financial institutions, such as banks, insurance companies and investment management firms.  Customers and clients could then control who their company information is being shared with and would be able to keep track of the authorizations using blockchain-based smart contracts.“With this proof of concept and related ecosystem, we demonstrate the benefits of using blockchain [technology] and smart contract[s] to considerably reduce the costs of one of the most important burdens of our institutional clients: KYC and customer onboarding,” Chollet explained.Blockchain Technology Is Making Waves in RegTechRegTech (regulatory technology), a relatively new branch of financial technology, focuses on leveraging innovative new technologies to improve regulatory reporting and monitoring as well as compliance processes for financial institutions.The financial industry is particularly keen on this subsector of fintech as financial regulations have tightened substantially since the 2008 global financial crisis, which has led banks to invest heavily in the areas of KYC/AML, compliance and risk management. Hence, any solution that will help banks to streamline their processes and reduce overheads will be very welcome by financial situations.As Bitcoin Magazine reported in April, blockchain technology is making waves in RegTech. The integration of distributed ledger technology into compliance systems and processes could save financial institutions up to 50 percent in compliance costs, according to blockchain startup Coinfirm and management consulting firm Accenture.Using blockchain technology, data security could be improved, manual processes could be digitized, customer onboarding documents could be verified for authenticity, the speed and accuracy of daily regulatory reporting to regulators could be increased, and digital identities could be created for companies, which can then be shared among permissioned financial institutions, as Deloitte’s new KYC-as-a-service product is aiming to do.Deloitte plans to roll out its new KYC-as-a-service solution to financial institutions this summer, and the newly developed KYCstart will be one of the proposed onboarding channels for this service.Can identity trust be integrated with blockchain technology? The answer to that question appears to be yes, according to a recently completed proof-of-concept study conducted by Peer Ledger, a Canadian blockchain company; SAFE-BioPharma Association, the organization managing the global SAFE-BioPharma digital identity management standard; and Synchronoss, a leading provider of standards-based digital identities.This development is believed to have significant implications for the use of distributed electronic ledgers (i.e., blockchains) for medical, pharmaceutical and other health system applications.The purpose of the study was to demonstrate that cyber identities that comply with the SAFE-BioPharma standard may, via Peer Ledger APIs, enable blockchain identities to be de-anonymized, thereby fulfilling a requirement for double-blind clinical trials, audits and responsible supply chains. Prior to the study, identities associated with distributed electronic ledgers were entirely anonymous.“Identity trust” means that there is trust in each cyber identity, using a process that proves the individual’s identity before linking it to the cyber credential. In general terms, it means that the credential can be trusted to represent the vetted identity of the individual one is doing business with but has never met face-to-face. This is critically important to the pharma/life sciences space because of several factors, including deterrence of hackers seeking valuable patient records and intellectual property, as well as compliance with regulations protecting patient data.These discoveries underscore the power of blockchain technology to disrupt traditional practices for drug discovery, patient engagement and monitoring, payments and participatory healthcare delivery. Here, the technology leverages its quality as a shared, synchronized, distributed ledger of transactions, fostering security and decreasing fraud by providing a permanent record of who accessed ledgers and what activities they engaged in.  The proof of concept demonstrated that SAFE-BioPharma-compliant digital identities can be tied back to the blockchain to assure trust in the identity of each person engaged in the transaction. Transactions can be anonymous until the end of a clinical study and “chained back” to the proven identity of the user, if needed, for regulatory or clinical purposes. Alternatively, the identities associated with each block can be known throughout the process, such as in track-and-trace applications for the medical supply chain.Blockchain technology’s use of a group-consensus algorithm can be used to catch intentional or inadvertent double spending of an asset. For example, an accounts-receivable blockchain application can provide “multiple eyes” to prevent double invoicing. Similarly, a counterfeit-catching purchasing blockchain application can prevent harmful substances and devices from entering the medical system.Ultimately, for blockchain technology to reach its full potential in any sector, myriad systems must be interoperable. Currently, healthcare technologies rarely work in a highly synchronized way with one another, which is why pharmaceutical and other medical companies that already have powerful identity management tools are trialing a number of different blockchain-based applications.Thus far, these apps have been unable to bridge to the systems pharma companies use to establish identity credentials for their personnel. This is the problem addressed in the proof of concept. Peer Ledger has therefore developed software that now maps a trusted identity, from the Synchronoss-implemented Verizon Universal Identity Services system to blockchain credentials.“Every SAFE-BioPharma-compliant identity credential accurately represents the proven identity of the person using it,” explains Mollie Shields-Uehling, president and CEO of SAFE-BioPharma Association. “Teaming these credentials with anonymous blockchain ledger postings enables use cases critical for overall cybersecurity across healthcare and the life sciences.”When asked about future applications of all of this for healthcare, Shields-Uehling and Dawn Jutla, CEO and founder of Peer Ledger, highlighted three major areas of blockchain intersection.Blockchain and clinical trials: In order to co-partner in the discovery of cures, patients may give pharmaceutical companies direct access to their digitized healthcare records, thus improving both data used for research and the speed of patient treatment. Britain’s Chief Scientific Officer, Sir Mark Walport, has argued that the National Health Service, which provides healthcare for 65 million people, should use blockchain technology to improve such tasks as the sharing of health records.Blockchain and data collection: Earlier this year, IBM Watson Health announced it would work with the FDA to develop a secure, efficient and scalable exchange of health data using blockchain technology. Oncology data will be the initial focus.Blockchain and personalized precision medicine: Blockchain technology’s cryptography will secure economical home healthcare sensor feeds. Trusted identity will be important to ensure that the right test results are associated with the right patient.Netki, the New York–based software startup, wants to make blockchain technology more user friendly by launching its new universal Netki Digital ID service, so that anyone can access services on blockchains without re-validating their ID at every stop. The Netki Digital ID will be both KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) verified, allowing users to access a variety of blockchain businesses including financial institutions like banks, exchanges and healthcare services.Netki wants their ID to work on any blockchain, public or private, around the world and to provide automated onboarding and validation of new customers, as well as easy sharing of digital identities.The company’s goal is to create a digital identity certificate that uses a standard recognized by governments everywhere as legally validated, to process transactions anywhere in the world. Pricing will be based on the number of certificates and the complexity of validations.The Digital ID uses a new peer-to-peer payment protocol (BIP 75) that allows senders, receivers and their financial partners to exchange all four identities via a private encrypted channel.According to Netki’s announcement, the Netki Digital ID service will allow for the easy capture of an individual’s documents and biometrics via their smartphone, along with multiple levels of automated and manual verification, including database checks, machine learning and biometric analysis.International Compliance: A “Herculean Task”Netki IDs are already in use in the U.S. and Europe on the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains, and the company is hoping to expand its service both to new jurisdictions around the world and on new blockchain networks.Netki’s CEO and Co-Founder Justin Newton talked to Bitcoin Magazine about the process of expanding its ID service, despite the challenge of many different legal requirements in an international regulatory environment.The regulatory landscape is changing around the world at a rapid pace. With this in mind we designed our tools and protocols to be flexible in the case of differing, new or expanding regulatory requirements.“As we work on each new use case, we work with the customer’s risk and compliance team to determine what requirements are appropriate for their needs.”Newton told us their team spends time in each new jurisdiction consulting with local regulators before offering their service.Amber D. Scott, whose company Outlier Solutions  works with blockchain startups on compliance and security issues, admires the spirit and sheer scope of Netki’s undertaking but recognizes that it is a herculean task to have any ID be compliant in every jurisdiction.She recommends that companies planning to implement any new identification solutions should thoroughly research the requirements of the jurisdictions they are operating in, to ensure “that a solution meets those requirements in their entirety.”Scott added, “We spend a lot of time with our clients conducting this type of testing, and very few solutions pass the tests.”Michael Perklin, an internationally recognized security expert who oversees security for ShapeShift, acknowledges that verifying users can be time-consuming and expensive, and agrees that something like a universal ID would make this process easier.“Many people complain that there are 20+ different identity standards and it seems that Netki is proposing a 21st. It seems like a great idea in theory but its success would depend on the community adopting the Netki ID as the industry standard as opposed to another service like uPort.”UPort offers a mobile app that allows users to create self-sovereign credentials that would allow them to process transactions on blockchains.Newton told us that while uPort is focusing on a business model, Netki has open-sourced their protocol. Another important difference between the two companies is that uPort stores private information on the blockchain while Netki stores information off-chain. That being said, Netki is currently partnering with uPort on several projects.Caribbean Service Bitt Is the Test CaseNetki chose the Caribbean region to test its new service, partnering with fintech company Bitt, which provides a mobile wallet and payment services to anywhere in the world.Newton told us:“In terms of the project that we are working on with Bitt, we believe that one of the greatest promises of blockchain [technology] is around financial inclusion. The Caribbean region has far greater mobile phone penetration than banking penetration, and most banking is effectively controlled overseas,” he said.By creating a locally run and focused alternative, they can lower the cost of remittance, spur inter-island trade and service many people currently excluded from banking and online finance.Empowering Individuals Over InstitutionsNetki’s founders believe that blockchain technology is the game-changer that will take society to the next level, allowing more democratization and levelling of existing silos.Newton believes that blockchain technology is a means of empowering individuals and changing the way society interacts with each other; however, without easy access for the majority of people, universal adoption will remain a dream.As part of simplifying and making blockchain technology more user friendly, Netki already offers a wallet-naming service for $9.99 per year, which allows users to register their unwieldy wallet address of letters and numbers to a simple name, making for easier transactions for both users and businesses.Newton is excited about the future possibilities of blockchain technology for decentralization and democratization, saying:“For the first time, using the standards we implemented at Bitt, and more broadly with BIP 75, regulated entities such as banks can operate on public networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum while still meeting their risk and compliance requirements.  With the recent institutional interest, and positive government movement around digital currency, these tools couldn’t come at a better time to enable the ecosystem to really step up to the next level in terms of both usage and opportunity.”Netki is partnering with IBM in the Hyperledger Project and with PwC Australia in its Vulcan Project.Investors in Netki include O'Reilly, AlphaTech Ventures, Colle Capital, Digital Currency Group, Plug and Play, the Husseine Group, Bitfinex and Base Ventures.In January of 2016, when Vinny Lingham announced that he had stepped down as CEO of the popular mobile gift card service Gyft, speculation began to bubble up as to what innovation sandbox he would be stepping into next. A vocal advocate for Bitcoin and the blockchain movement in the media and at industry events, he has been a leading pioneer in the effort to integrate bitcoin payments at Gyft during his tenure there. As CEO of Civic, a new startup company focused on digital identity, Lingham is now in pursuit of a new entrepreneurial quest. Civic’s mission is to deliver secure, low-cost identity verification that’s decentralized via blockchain technology. Consumers will have the ability to share information such as their social security or identity numbers securely from any device with digital signatures that validate that the information hasn’t been tampered with.On May 23, Lingham and Civic CTO Jonathan Smith formally announced their launch of services at Consensus 2017, offering a viable solution to ID theft, fake online profiles and bank accounts, and other data breaches that have an adverse impact on consumer identity. Civic also unveiled their plans at the Token Summit for a token offering on the Ethereum platform. A final token will be issued on the RSK platform.Civic tokens will provide access to the product while allowing token holders to benefit from its network effect. Overall, Civic endeavors to raise $33 million through the token sale, with additional tokens beyond that allocated to enterprise partners and developers. The company has already received $2.75 million in funding via Social Leverage, an early-stage seed investment fund, as well as through various VC firms that are engaged in Bitcoin and blockchain technology, including Pantera Capital, Blockchain Capital and Digital Currency Group.Civic’s stealth digital identity platform is designed to replace passwords, usernames and the need for biometrics. The company’s main value proposition targets the explosion of data breaches that hit both consumers and the businesses they engage with. Civic will deliver applications for securing cryptocurrencies, e-signatures, social accounts, financial services, e-commerce/credit cards and medical records. Moreover, it will have the capacity to be used as a digital replacement for passports, driver’s licenses and voter ID, among other utilities.Consumers will install an app on their smart device, and when someone attempts to access their SSNs within their personal ecosystems, they get notified. This serves as a preventive measure for the unauthorized use of personal information. Ultimately the goal is to deliver solutions for consumers to better control their personal information while providing a positive customer service experience.Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Lingham noted that ID theft is a pervasive issue, especially with the recent spate of around 2,000 data breaches per year in the U.S. alone.Civic wants to solve this problem by granting people control of their identity and where their personal information is stored. By verifying their information and storing it on their personal devices, consumers can ensure that their identity information is only distributed to authorized parties. He emphasized that when a consumer or business uses the Civic login service, no usernames or passwords are created, thereby reducing the vulnerabilities associated around one hack being able to to access other accounts.Lingham believes that blockchains are likely the most secure place to store information right now, which is why Civic is constantly assessing opportunities to leverage and capitalize on the emerging technology.Regarding the often-knotty scenarios created around securing government acceptance and collaboration, Lingham said: “We believe that the technology we have is unique and highly differentiated. That said, as we continue to build our user base and network for acceptance, this will draw in governments. We have already had some interest in this area and believe it will only be a matter of time.”Based in Palo Alto, California, Lingham says he plans to open an office in his native South Africa with the goal of hiring developers there. He decided to take this ambitious step following reforms to South Africa’s business regulations that have created a more favorable environment for investments.“We’ve always believed that one of the best applications for cryptocurrencies was the ability to power something like voting, one day,” said Lingham. “In order to get there, the larger distributed mobile identity problem needed to be solved first. This is what we are focusing on now — to build the world’s largest identity platform, powered by technology that decentralizes and secures consumer identity information.”Gun violence continues to be a hot topic. Gang violence in neighborhoods, terrorist attacks in cities, accidental gun discharge among kids, mass attacks at schools and businesses — these and other forms of gun activities are leading to calls for reform throughout the world.Through the use of smart technology, the startup Blocksafe seeks to deliver a blockchain-centric solution for gun ownership and their safe use. Its core premise is predicated on a key issue tied to firearms, namely the danger they pose when they migrate into the hands of non-owners.With the support of the Blocksafe Foundation, an organization evangelizing smart-gun technology and gun-ownership freedoms, an innovative device and decentralized network is advancing in its development. Its mission is to create a safer world through weapons tracking and accountability, preventing guns from falling into the wrong hands and being utilized by unauthorized gun users.Citizens, law enforcement agencies and armed security firms will have 24/7 real-time access to the secure and anonymous Blocksafe network, thereby allowing them the ability to self-monitor their supported firearms devices. Owners can receive notifications if shots are fired by an unauthorized user of their guns. Moreover, they have the ability to locate and disable a stolen weapon, all through the Blocksafe app or web portal.It should be noted, however, that Blocksafe cannot identify the actual shooter who is utilizing the firearm. Rather it’s more of a tracking mechanism for both individual owners as well as gun store owners, giving them peace of mind as to where their firearms are at all times.By way of example, an adult at work might remember that his gun is possibly accessible to his kids at home. Blocksafe can help him track where the gun actually is and even remotely disable it. Again, the goal is to offer some semblance of control to the owner in the event that the firearm ends up in the hands of an unauthorized user, which often results in a gun tragedy.Another illustrative use case: A gun owner whose house is robbed while she is away can remotely disable the stolen firearm, rendering it unable to be resold or used later in a crime.Pulling the Trigger on InnovationKevin Barnes, founder and chairman of Blocksafe, is an honorably discharged U.S. Army veteran, blockchain developer and passionate advocate of gun ownership. He is also a tech coder of 20 years.Raised among liberty-minded gun lovers, he was taught to embrace the U.S. constitutional right to bear arms first and foremost. As he listened to and read about politicians pushing smart-gun efforts in the media, he feared a loss of life or liberty due to risks inherited by a centralized smart-gun infrastructure. These concerns led him to launch Blocksafe.In this interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Barnes discusses the evolution of Blocksafe and his greatest hopes around the future of gun safety worldwide.  Can you describe the moment when the Blocksafe idea first struck you?Being an avid gun lover, I was at a range teaching my wife to shoot various firearms and she began thinking about what to do if she was overpowered by a thug while she was armed. At that moment the concept of “Blocksafe” was born. In layman's terms, what is Blocksafe?I tend to think of Blocksafe as a light version of particle.io for enhanced firearm technology. It is a full-stack IoT device network that gives innovators what they need to enable users to securely manage their devices and data. Blocksafe can also facilitate an innovator’s use case in IoT development, expediting their roadmap to the market with security and anonymity for the user and sensor data being the major area of focus.Blocksafe enables innovators to develop a myriad of solutions to solve the problems associated with firearms — such as malware and ransomware risks — that were not possible before without compromise.How does this benefit the gun industry?Decentralized applications (DApps) can be developed in a way that greatly benefits companies in the gun industry. For example, a third-party device is created by a manufacturer. They could install a custom-built DApp onto it, so the manufacturer can easily track its inventory and distribution.What about the economics of your solution?Economically, revenue can be generated from the upsale of enhanced add-on devices to firearms. With the cost of the IoT infrastructure greatly reduced, innovators can focus on improving their product to meet market demands, especially those from a newer generation who are always connected. Innovators can also better meet government and commercial needs for these enhancing devices.What sorts of other use cases are being bantered about?Here are a few that might align with the Blocksafe model.Litigation: enhancing the authenticity of a camera video allowed in court proceedings.Product Theft: a gunstore can recoup their firearms if stolen.Insurance: armoured trucks and security companies in general can better monitor and manage the firearm usage of their employees.Training: Instructors can use analytics to study shooting skills to better train students, thereby reducing the likelihood of accidents.What are Blocksafe trigger tokens and how will they work?Triggers are the appropriately named “tokens” that power every event from smart devices to the Blocksafe network. The token is an Counterparty asset (which may become ERC223 later) that will be introduced during demonstrations at CoinAgenda in Las Vegas later this year.What else are you currently introducing?Soon we will be demonstrating with the TrackingPoint M400 to our  smart-gun network. There are many sensors, a smart trigger and a smart scope on the firearm that make it a great candidate to use in demonstration.We will also be introducing another DApp use case made for mobile phones and tablets called “Gunshot Spot.” It’s a free gunfire-mapping app and token wallet that sends notifications of gunfire and its proximity. Users will have the option to anonymously share the data to the app community, which will be used to populate gunfire mapping within the app using Blocksafe. Think of it as SpotCrime for gunfire.What steps have you taken to garner support from the gun industry?We have provided a pilot signup page for our network’s web portal. We are also in talks with many firearm and accessory manufacturers, some of which we met at the recent NRA show in Atlanta. A quarter of them expressed positive interest in Blocksafe as they recognize that nothing is stopping the progression of defense tech and the launch of Blocksafe. One exhibitor summed it up in one sentence: “Blocksafe’s use case is that it enables use cases development for enhanced firearm solutions that were never possible before.”We’ve also received a lot of support from organizations that support the firearm industry such as Smart Tech Foundation, which we plan to join in their effort to support startup innovators entering the enhanced firearm space.What is your response to libertarians and others concerned about gun privacy and anonymity?What I say to them is that enhanced firearm tech is going to continue to develop no matter what. When I was following the smart-gun mandates from President Obama and his administration, all I could picture was my wife, kids and future grandkids with a weapon that some third party could share control of.As a programmer of 20 years and a Bitcoin enthusiast, I realized the only solution was to bring to market a network that would prevent that nightmare. At the same time, we can use the blockchain to save lives by enhancing the very tool that has been protecting our freedom in such a way that the device owner keeps full control of the device features and data.As is the belief of many libertarians, I have the liberty to choose how to defend myself and my family. It is our human right. Whether it is using a 25-year-old revolver or a TrackingPoint AR, we all have the liberty to choose our firearm of choice.But how do you think these arguments will sit with the government?We spend millions to politically protect our legal rights to defend ourselves. We must also focus on making sure the technology is not used against us — as, without an alternative, the chances of technical tyranny is a threat too great to chance — regardless of the laws.Plus, I think it is cool not being able to be shot with my own weapon.What is your long-term, grand vision for Blocksafe?Simply to continue to help grow the enhanced-firearm space including expanding the consortium globally. We will try to incubate startups and launch Smart Gun News to showcase the innovators and aggregate news in the space. We also endeavor to work with nations to adopt blockchain tech and their smart city efforts in general. Ultimately, as I see it, it’s about promoting a safer and more peaceful world full of liberty.Monitor blockchains, deanonymize wallet addresses, surveil dark net markets, and stop terrorists and money launderers: that’s the main thrust of the European Union’s Project TITANIUM.TITANIUM, which stands for Tools for the Investigation of Transactions in Underground Markets, is a three-year, €5 million ($5.5 million) project that will unite universities, private research firms and law enforcement agencies from the U.K., Germany, Spain, Austria, the Netherlands and Finland.Project TITANIUM will develop tools and best practices for criminal investigations involving cryptocurrency in Europe, which, up to now, most law enforcement agencies have pursued on an ad-hoc basis.The project plans to create forensic tools to spot clusters of addresses controlled by the same entity; identify mixers or tumbler addresses used for money laundering; crawl the webs, both clear and dark; and automate information gathering about illegal activities.The project’s coordinator, Dr. Ross King of the Austrian Institute of Technology, said that criminal and terrorist uses of cryptocurrencies and dark net markets “evolve quickly.” King also insisted that Project TITANIUM would respect “citizen privacy.”Project TITANIUM’s announcement comes just a few weeks after the ransomware worm WannaCry disabled hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150 countries. As of June 15, 2017, the hardcoded wallet addresses used by the attackers have collected about 50 BTC in ransom payments.The project’s scope covers terrorism, as well as crime, and back-to-back attacks in Manchester and London have ignited calls for more sweeping government action to combat extremism.On June 4, 2017, Prime Minister Theresa May called for “international agreements to regulate cyberspace” and to deny violent extremists “safe spaces” online. With terrorism in the background, cooperation on internal security matters like Project TITANIUM is likely to continue even after the U.K. formally exits the EU.The call for more surveillance comes despite the fact that the United Kingdom already has one of the most wide-ranging surveillance laws, the Investigatory Powers Act, which went into force December 30, 2016.Nicknamed the Snooper’s Charter, the act requires ISPs keep record of all websites users visit for one year and allows police and other public agencies to check anyone’s history without a warrant.Meanwhile, the EU is mulling a more direct approach to the problem of cryptocurrency. According to a proposed directive released on March 9, 2017, the EU could require exchanges and wallet providers to submit account owners’ identities to a central database.The directive goes on that “virtual currencies should not be anonymous,” and that the anonymity or pseudo-anonymity of cryptocurrencies is “more a hindrance than an asset” for legitimate users.The rules would not just apply to bitcoin, but all “virtual currencies,” and would effectively ban anonymous cryptocurrency, at least in the EU. The proposed directive is intended to combat money laundering and terrorism, despite scant evidence that cryptocurrencies play a prominent role in either.Nevertheless, with or without evidence that they are empowering terrorists, the anonymous or pseudo-anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies is threatening to European lawmakers, and whether through legislation or projects like TITANIUM, they intend to decloak cryptocurrency.TumbleBit is one of the most promising privacy-enhancing technologies being built on top of Bitcoin right now. It allows users to mix their coins fully anonymously, without requiring trust in any third party. An advanced version of the technology, which requires Segregated Witness, can even be utilized as a second-layer payment hub to reduce transaction costs and speed up confirmation times.After TumbleBit was first proposed in an academic paper and subsequently presented at the Scaling Bitcoin workshops in Milan, NBitcoin lead developer Nicolas Dorier built an early version of the technology. Since then, two wallets are being developed to make TumbleBit accessible for everyday use: Breeze and, more recently, HiddenWallet.HiddenWallet developer Ádám Ficsór, better known online as “nopara73,” also completed Tor integration this week.I estimate that TumbleBit will be usable for the general public within a month or two. —Ádám FicsórTor IntegrationTumbleBit lets users connect to a central server, which in turn allows them to establish payment channels that send coins back and forth in such a way that everyone receives as many coins as they sent. Multiple users can engage at the same time, which allows them to mix their coins, breaking the trail of ownership on Bitcoin’s blockchain.The key innovation compared to previous mixing models is that TumbleBit uses a combination of nifty cryptographic tricks to make sure that, first off, no one can steal funds. And second, no one — not even the central server — can link any of the sending addresses to any of the receiving addresses.Well, almost. One problem remained, as Ficsór explained:“Users connect to the central server with their own IP address to provide their sending and receiving addresses,” he said. “But this means that the central server could still match sending and receiving addresses based on the IP address that provided them. If one IP address provides both Bitcoin addresses, it’s trivial to link them.”This would of course defeat the purpose of using TumbleBit in the first place.Ficsór therefore built a Tor-integration tool for the existing TumbleBit project. With this tool, the sending and receiving addresses of any user are separately provided to the central server through the anonymity network. This removes any link from a user’s IP address to any specific Bitcoin addresses and — importantly — removes the link between sending and receiving addresses as well.Wallet PrivacyAt the same time, Ficsór is developing a new wallet specifically designed for TumbleBit, HiddenWallet. And interestingly, this wallet would even offer increased privacy without TumbleBit.Essentially all lightweight wallets leak address data to the outside world in some way or another. Most web wallets, mobile wallets and some desktop wallets leak this info because they rely on a server that tells them about their balances. This server therefore needs to know all addresses in a wallet and can link them together accordingly.Alternatively, some SPV clients send out a type of cryptographic “puzzle” (Bloom filters) to the network that requests all data relevant for their balance. But this leaks address data to random nodes on the network … and thus to analytics companies that specifically monitor the network for these puzzles.“Blockstream’s Jonas Nick claimed in 2014 that if someone were to give him one Bitcoin address, he’d be able to figure out 70 percent of your wallet holdings. This was just one smart guy with limited resources, three years ago. You can imagine what well-funded analytics companies in 2017 are capable of,” Ficsór noted.This linking of addresses is obviously a problem for TumbleBit users. No matter how much these users mix their bitcoins across their Bitcoin addresses, if all these addresses can be linked together anyway, there’s no point.The only wallets that avoid this problem, so far, are full-node wallets like Bitcoin Core. These wallets download all transaction data on the network, meaning they don’t need to request specific data that reveals their own addresses. However, full nodes can be a bit resource-intensive, which is a barrier to entry for many casual Bitcoin users.HiddenWalletHiddenWallet introduces a clever model in between the lightweight and full-node wallets, specifically designed to improve privacy.Like a full node, HiddenWallet connects directly to the Bitcoin network, where it likewise requests all transaction data from random nodes. However, where full nodes verify (and typically store) all of this data, HiddenWallet instead immediately discards any data it doesn’t need. It only verifies and stores transaction data that involve the Bitcoin addresses in the wallet itself and doesn’t care about the rest. This requires far fewer resources than a full node does.“The privacy benefit is obvious,” said Ficsór. “Since HiddenWallet downloads all transaction data, connected nodes have no idea which data is kept by the wallet and what is discarded. They learn nothing about the addresses in HiddenWallet and can’t link any of them together.”And Ficsór thinks he may be able to trim resource usage down even further in a next release of HiddenWallet. This upcoming version may cut out all transaction data that would, for analytics companies, obviously not be relevant to the wallet anyway. This includes old transaction data, but also specific types of transactions. Such a modification could potentially make HiddenWallet available even on low-bandwidth mobile connections.With this progress, it looks like TumbleBit may be usable even before the end of this summer, Ficsór estimates.“We previously thought we might get the system up and running around this time, but it turned out there was a little bit more to it than we thought. That being said, another big hurdle is now taken: the Japanese company United Bitcoiners is running a tumbling server. Combined with Tor integration and wallets, all pieces of the puzzle are coming together.”It comes with the territory that digital currency will be susceptible to digital threats. Hacking and theft have almost grown up side by side with things like Bitcoin, and, as the popularity and value of the digital currency rises, its attraction to thieves also grows.The most recent major hack has seen one of the top five biggest Bitcoin and Ethereum exchanges, Bithumb in South Korea, fall prey to hackers. The hack was confirmed July 5 when information, as well as hundreds of millions of South Korean won, were been made off with in an attack with a difference.Most exchanges know they are susceptible to network intrusion via their internal systems, but the entry point in this instance was through the personal computer of one of the exchange's employees. Thus it was not the standard network compromise, rather a more sophisticated phishing attack that led to the information heist.It was personal information, such as names, email address and phone numbers of clients that were predominantly taken — luckily no passwords — but this was enough for the hackers to target customers and drain their accounts of their cryptocurrency.Since the highly publicized Mt. Gox hack in 2014, in which 800,000 bitcoins were stolen, exchanges have boosted their security astronomically. Mt. Gox almost spelled the end of Bitcoin as people lost a lot of faith — as well as a lot of money — in the security systems of cryptocurrencies.While security has been boosted in recent times, and thievery and hacking is far less common, it is still a threat that is ongoing and sometimes hidden.In fact, Bithumb customers had forwarded complaints on a Korean social media site about threats of attacks, yet not much extra was done on the part of the exchange to try and quell these worries or protect clients.The exact figure stolen is still unknown as Bithumb is trying to play it off as less of a hack and more of a phishing attack for information. However, despite what they are trying to convey, Bithumb has to admit that the 30,000 customers whose information was compromised were victims of a dangerous cryptocurrency attack.The Korean exchange has come forward and said it will be compensating those whose data was compromised. Even those customers who would have lost nothing other than data will be getting paid 100,000 Korean Won, which is equivalent to around $86.50 USD for the inconvenience. The hope for Bithumb is that they will be able to retain some of these clients who surely will be feeling much more vulnerable and less trusting.Bithumb's transactions with bitcoin make up almost 3 percent of the entire market, but it is its share of ether transactions that’s its major claim to fame: 13.5 percent of the total ether market goes through Bithumb’s exchange.It is a major blow for a big player in the exchange game, and it is a blow that will be felt in the global digital currency sphere. Trust has slowly been rebuilt for those who have lived through the teething stages of Bitcoin security, and, as the door opens on new and mainstream markets, hacks like this can cause adopters to have second thoughts.However, one aspect of digital security that has changed since bitcoin has been accepted by a much wider audience is that governmental agencies are taking it under their wing.There are differing stages of regulation for digital currencies, but these arguably bring with them added security. In the case of Bithumb, Korea’s Internet and Security Agency has plans to initiate a probe into this cyber attack with a full investigation to follow.Ádám “nopara73” Ficsór, HiddenWallet developer and TumbleBit contributor, and “TDevD,” the pseudonymous Samourai wallet developer, are joining forces on a new privacy project: ZeroLink. ZeroLink is set to realize a trustless mixing scheme first proposed by Bitcoin Core contributor Gregory Maxwell years ago — but one that hasn’t been realized thus far.According Ficsór, the ZeroLink framework, which utilizes a scheme known as “Chaumian CoinJoin,” is actually more straightforward than many of the alternatives that have been proposed.“Back in 2013, there was this sort of obsession with decentralization. ‘Everything that can be decentralized will be decentralized’ was the slogan,” the developer recalls. “By now we realize that decentralization is actually not always that useful. As long as a mixer cannot steal funds or link transactions, that’s enough.”CoinJoinEach Bitcoin transaction essentially sends bitcoins from one or several Bitcoin addresses (really: “inputs”) to one or several Bitcoin addresses (really: “outputs”). That’s how bitcoins “move” over the blockchain.The problem, from a privacy perspective, is that the blockchain is completely public, which means that anyone can see which addresses are paying which addresses. If these addresses can be linked to real-world identities, it can reveal a lot about who transacted with whom, and perhaps for what.CoinJoin, the well-known coin-mixing scheme first proposed by Maxwell in 2013, is a potential solution to this problem. A CoinJoin transaction is basically a combination of several transactions merged into one big transaction. In other words, it includes inputs from several different users, and the bitcoins move to outputs controlled by several different users. As such, it’s not clear which bitcoins moved where. All users effectively paid all users.While that’s great, the next problem is that whomever or whatever combines the different transactions into one CoinJoin transaction can be a central point of failure from a privacy perspective. That person (or that server, or whatever it is) still knows which bitcoins moved where. So if that individual is either corrupt or corruptible, the problem isn’t really solved.“For CoinJoin to live up to its promise, even the entity that creates the transaction must not learn which addresses are paying which addresses,” Ficsór noted.ZeroLinkZeroLink provides a privacy framework for wallets that can be used for different mixing schemes. And it defines its own mixing technique as well: an implementation of CoinJoin referred to as “Chaumian CoinJoin.”With Chaumian CoinJoin, users both send and receive equal amounts of bitcoin from a CoinJoin transaction, so everyone receives each other's coins. This obfuscates the trails for all of these coins.In practice, ZeroLink users will require two types of wallets: a pre-mix wallet and a post-mix wallet. As the names suggest, the first type holds coins that are to be mixed, while the latter is where the mixed coins end up.Users then connect their pre-mix wallets to the ZeroLink tumbler and provide an input (“from” address) and an output (“to” address), which they both control. But importantly, the outputs are disguised (“blinded”) using a mathematical trick. So while the tumbler knows where all bitcoins are sent from, it does not yet know where bitcoins are sent to.At the heart of the trick, the tumbler then cryptographically signs all blinded outputs, using a type of cryptographic signature introduced by David Chaum: a “blind signature.” This allows data to be cryptographically signed even if it is disguised. And importantly, these signatures can be checked against the original, unblinded data as well to see if the blinded data and the unblinded data match.Next, all users connect to the tumbler again, but this time through some type of anonymity network, like Tor. They will then provide the tumbler with the unblinded versions of the outputs. Using the cryptographic signatures it just created, the tumbler can check that all revealed outputs match all blinded outputs. If they do match, the tumbler knows that all the outputs it received are legitimate, and thus were provided by the same users that also provided the inputs to send funds.The tumbler then adds the revealed outputs to the CoinJoin transaction. And it sends this transaction back to all users, for these users to sign with their Bitcoin private keys. Doing so validates the transaction. (The users should of course double check that the amounts and their outputs check out, to be sure they receive as much as they send.)Finally, the tumbler broadcasts the CoinJoin transaction to be included in a Bitcoin block. As a result, all users end up with different bitcoins than they started with: all bitcoins were mixed, and the blockchain trails broken.While all this is actually relatively straightforward compared to some alternative schemes, and to a large extent already suggested by Maxwell back in 2013, the process has never been realized. This is probably because it was long thought to be too vulnerable to attacks, Ficsór thinks.“When Maxwell first published the proposal, Bitcoin transaction fees were practically non-existent. Because of this, it would be relatively easy and cheap to launch denial of service attacks against a CoinJoin mixing system. An attacker can just keep providing valid inputs, but refuse to sign when he should. That invalidates the whole transaction, and wastes everyone’s time.”Interestingly, this attack vector is now to some extent resolved simply because it would be too expensive to keep it going. In order to maintain the attack in a way that it’s not easily countered, an attacker must provide new inputs for each round, meaning he must be able to keep moving bitcoins to new addresses to do so. “Assuming $1 transaction fees, that could cost up to $1,000 a day,” Ficsór pointed out. “In this particular context, high fees are a blessing in disguise.”DevelopmentFicsór is currently about to help wrap up the development of another highly anticipated privacy tool, TumbleBit, for Stratis’s Breeze Wallet. This is expected to take another three months.After that, he plans to focus on realizing ZeroLink, while TDevD may even start working on the framework sooner. Concretely, three new codebases need to be developed: the pre-mix wallet, the tumbler and the post-mix wallet.“The tumbler needs to be developed from scratch. But it should be relatively easy to add the pre-mix wallets to any existing open source wallet. The same is true for the post-mix wallet implementations, though for privacy reasons not all wallets are a good fit,” Ficsór said.His own HiddenWallet as well as Samourai Wallet are “fully committed” to implementing and deploying ZeroLink into production, Ficsór said, while Breeze Wallet may be interested as well.Optimistically, an initial implementation of ZeroLink could be live before the end of this year.Governments and central banks all over the world are gradually warming up to the idea of leveraging the unique advantages offered by blockchain technology — low-cost transactions permanently recorded in tamper-proof distributed ledgers — to modernize their financial systems.According to sources familiar with the matter, the Indian government is considering a proposal to introduce its own cryptocurrency similar to Bitcoin, Business Standard reported last week. The new cryptocurrency would be managed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and could be called “Lakshmi.” Other central banks are exploring similar ideas.Of course, that will take time, and the governments are unlikely to support important features that make Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies appealing to end users, such as mining and near-anonymous, paperwork-free transactions. Therefore, Bitcoin, Ethereum and at least some altcoins are likely to continue to prosper.But some governments, such as China’s, don’t seem to like that. After banning Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), the Chinese government is moving to close the cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the country.It appears that governments love blockchain technology but hate Bitcoin itself, as well as other “crypto-anarchic” digital currencies. Some governments are reacting in a panic because they are starting to realize that they can’t stop Bitcoin from becoming an alternative to their monopoly on currency, both as a means of exchange and a store of value. Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges are especially vulnerable, and other governments could follow China.A Role for Decentralized ExchangesDecentralized exchanges that use peer-to-peer (P2P) technology to bypass the need for a central exchange provider are an interesting option that could make blockchain-based digital currencies much more resilient.Decred recently introduced atomic swap support for exchange-free cryptocurrency trading, showing that, at least for crypto-to-crypto trading (for example, exchanging bitcoin for litecoin), it’s perfectly possible to operate without exchanges. However, this doesn’t solve the problem of crypto-to-fiat and fiat-to-crypto trading, which is arguably of top concern for cryptocurrency users.“Atomic swaps are the first sign in a new wave of decentralization,” Decred project lead Jake Yocom-Piatt told Bitcoin Magazine. “As trustless exchanges between pairs of cryptocurrencies, they offer new efficiencies for users who don’t need the formality of the traditional exchanges. It is going to be interesting to see how the trend develops, since for larger and more complex transactions with fiat currencies, LocalBitcoins and established exchanges are still the place to be.”  Coinffeine is developing an open-source, P2P Bitcoin exchange platform that will enable users to buy and sell bitcoins securely and anonymously, without having to rely on a centralized exchange. The project seems promising, but it hasn’t shown much activity recently.Bisq (formerly Bitsquare) provides an open-source desktop application that allows users to buy and sell bitcoins anonymously in exchange for national currencies or alternative cryptocurrencies. To protect users from fraud, both traders are required to place security deposits into a multisig-based escrow mechanism; the deposits are refunded after a trade completes. To handle disputes, Bisq features a decentralized and open arbitrator system. Bisq is now preparing to launch a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and its BSQ token, a colored coin on the Bitcoin blockchain.Decentralization and FreedomBitcoin Magazine reached out to Bisq developer Chris Beams for comments on government attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges, likely attack vectors and the impact of decentralized exchanges. Beams also offered a passionate and forceful defense of individual liberty against government over-interference.“The panic has to set in at some point,” argued Beams. “But it will do so at different times for different governments, and will produce a range of responses from them when it does. I don’t think China’s recent actions — whether they’re the product of panic or something more strategic — will necessarily cascade into similar actions in the U.S. or Europe. Shuttering all exchanges by diktat is the kind of textbook totalitarianism the world has come to expect from China, but a similar attack wouldn’t work as well in the U.S. Even if it would, it would be a blunder for the U.S. to attack Bitcoin with such a blunt instrument. It would be suboptimal, a bad use of available resources. It would strengthen the decentralized exchanges that already exist and it would incentivize the creation of better, even more censorship-resistant ones.”According to Beams, the U.S. in particular has much more effective tools at its disposal, especially Know Your Customer (KYC). The U.S. government forces nearly every centralized exchange, on day one of operation, to collect personal identity information about their users and to correlate trading activity with those identities.Beams explained that U.S. corporations tend to take compliance seriously and actually do cooperate with these rules, meaning that U.S. regulatory agencies have, in principle at least, access to enough information to de-anonymize a large and growing percentage of all Bitcoin transactions. And plausible traceability of transactions is all they need to keep the threat of tax collection in force.“If I were the U.S., I’d be ushering new Bitcoiners through the Coinbase cattle gate just as fast as they can be prodded,” said Beams. “If I were the U.S., I would have long since concluded there’s nothing fundamental I can do to stop Bitcoin itself, so if I can’t beat ’em, I’ll at least make sure I can continue to tax ’em.”The recent John Doe summons delivered to Coinbase by the IRS shows that KYC is the attack vector of choice for the U.S., which could result in billions in taxes reported by people who fear that their Bitcoin activity can be audited. KYC appears to be a much more effective long-term attack vector than heavy-handed shutdown orders.“So yes, by all means, let’s bring on the decentralized exchanges,” said Beams. “But they’d better be really and truly decentralized because if a government can stop them, they will — at least once they get big enough to become worth the effort. The attack vector with decentralized exchanges won’t be KYC, though, because any decentralized exchange that implements KYC will instantly be abandoned by its users.”The attack vector for decentralized exchanges, said Beams, will be “the good ole four horsemen of the infocalypse.” In other words, decentralized exchanges will be vilified as tools for drug dealers, terrorists, pedophiles and money launderers.“It’s the same script every time a government is interested in talking people out of their own freedoms. This attack vector won’t work for the exchanges that have achieved escape velocity levels of decentralization, but it may stop some and will make life difficult for others.”Beams suggested that the only way to really stop decentralized crypto-fiat exchanges would be to outlaw Bitcoin trading altogether. “This would force people to think twice about every trade, and to consider whether their counterparty might be an agent, which would result in a profound chilling effect.”However, he thinks that this sort of heavy-handed attack seems unlikely to be attempted in the U.S. or Europe because there are just too many vested interests in Bitcoin now. It’s more likely that the authorities will continue to insist on KYC, tolerate compliant centralized exchanges and demonize the decentralized ones.“With all that having been said, I’m actually optimistic,” concluded Beams. “Attacks by state actors — real and threatened — are making every part of this ecosystem stronger. Bitcoin has proven itself anti-fragile as hell thus far, and by the time all the battles have been waged, what will emerge on the other side are alternatives to existing financial institutions — money, banks, exchanges and all the rest — that are actually better in every way than their traditional counterparts.“We are being forced by the threat of state violence to design crypto-economic systems with the highest degrees of security, privacy and censorship resistance baked in from the protocol level up. That very pressure is what is propelling these solutions forward, I think, into a bright future of genuine financial freedom for people. I wouldn’t be working on this stuff if I thought otherwise.”Imperva Incapsula,a cloud-based service provider, has released a comprehensive report titled “Q3 2017 Global DDoS Threat Landscape.” The report shows that cryptocurrency operators and Bitcoin exchanges are favorite targets of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.A DDoS attack is defined as a persistent DDoS event against the same target (e.g., IP address or domain). A single attack is preceded by a quiet (attack free) period of at least 60 minutes and followed by another quiet period of the same duration or longer. Previous Imperva reports had considered DDoS attack bursts separated by 10 minute quiet periods, but then increased the quiet period time threshold to 60 minutes in order to aggregate successive attacks.DDoS attacks can be either network layer attacks that cause network saturation by consuming much of the available bandwidth or application layer attacks that bring down a server by consuming much of its processing resources (e.g., CPU or RAM) with a high number of requests; they are often facilitated by DDoS botnets. DDoS bots often masquerade as browsers (human visitors) or legitimate bots (e.g., search engine crawlers) to bypass security measures.The Imperva report is based on data from 3,920 network layer and 1,755 application layer DDoS attacks on websites using Imperva Incapsula services from July 1, 2017, through September 30, 2017. Information about DDoS botnets was gathered by analyzing data from 37.4 billion DDoS attack requests collected over the same period.Network layer DDoS attacks are measured in Mpps (million packets per second) and Gbps (gigabits per second), which indicate, respectively, the rate at which packets are delivered and the total load placed on a network. Five percent of network layer attacks reached 50 Mpps, while the largest peaked at 238 Mpps.Application layer DDoS attacks are measured in RPS (requests per second), and the overall impact also depends on the amount of workload that a single request can force on a target server. The main difference between the two DDoS-attack types is that one will target network connections and the other will target computing resources; each requires a different set of security methods for risk mitigation.The report noted that the cryptocurrency industry continues to be a frequent target of DDoS attacks, more so than many larger industries. In fact, three out of every four bitcoin sites were attacked in Q3 2017.“[We] saw attacks targeting a relatively high number of cryptocurrency exchanges and services,” states the report. “This was likely related to a recent spike in the price of bitcoin, which more than doubled in the span of the quarter. Overall, more than 73% of all bitcoin sites using our services were attacked this quarter, making it one of the most targeted industries, despite its relatively small size and web presence.”Other sectors frequently targeted by DDoS attacks are internet service providers and online gambling and gaming operators.For network layer DDoS attacks, the U.S., China, Hong Kong and the Philippines are among the top five countries, in terms of both number of attacks received and number of targets. Germany is also frequently attacked, with 12.8 percent of the total number of DDoS attacks.Hong Kong had only 5.1 percent of targets but was targeted by almost a third of all network layer attacks in Q3 2017. This was largely due to a large-scale campaign against a local hosting service provider which was hit more than 700 times throughout the quarter.For application layer DDoS attacks, the U.S. had both the highest number of attacks and the highest number of targets, with the Netherlands coming in a distant second. The largest application layer attack targeted a financial services company headquartered in Europe, which was hit multiple times. The remainder of the list include developed countries with mature digital marketplaces, such as Singapore, Japan and Australia.Identifying the origination of DDoS bots is difficult because the practice of faking a source IP — called IP spoofing — can make IP geo-data collected during DDoS attacks unreliable. IP spoofing is only possible for network layer attacks, however, since full TCP connections must be established before sending requests in application layer attacks. Thus, only data from application layer attacks was used to identify bot location.In Q3 2017, 17 percent of botnet traffic originated in China, which represents a significant drop from the previous quarter, when China was the source of 63 percent of botnet traffic. Turkey and India are on the rise and account for 7.2 and 4 percent of botnet traffic respectively. China remains the top location of attack devices with over 40 percent of the total.Application layer attack traffic generated by bots that can bypass cookie challenges increased to 6.4 percent in Q3 2017 from 2.1 percent in the previous quarter. Of these bots,1.8 percent were also able to parse JavaScript, an increase from 1.4 percent in Q2 2017.South Korean exchange Youbit announced on its website today that it is closing down after a hack early Tuesday, December 19, 2017, that resulted in the loss of 17 percent of its assets.The exchange, previously known as Yapizon, did not indicate how many bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies were stolen or what the total fiat value of the attack amounted to, but it was enough to lead to bankruptcy.This was the second hack the exchange suffered this year. A prior attack in April 2017, resulted in the loss of 3,816 bitcoins, worth around $5 million at the time.Youbit said hackers broke into its hot wallet, the online account used to pay out cryptocurrencies instantly. While hot wallets offer greater convenience, they also put funds at greater risk because they are connected to the internet.The remaining coins were kept offline in a cold wallet, the exchange said, resulting in no additional losses. The exchange indicated that customers could withdraw up to 75 percent of their balances, and the rest would be tallied out after the final settlement.Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA), the state agency that responds to cyberattacks, is investigating the incident, as reported in Reuters. KISA has maintained that North Korean hackers were behind the first hack.Chris Doman, threat engineer at software security company AlienVault, told Bitcoin Magazine, he suspects BlueNoroff, a subgroup of North Korea’s cyber crime group Lazarus is responsible for the second Youbit attack. Lazarus is known for the November 2014 hack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, one of the biggest corporate breaches in history.While attacks by Lazarus have mainly been aimed at social disruption, recent reports indicate the group is increasingly going after money. With the value of bitcoin surging to all-time highs, exchanges are becoming a lucrative target.“The first time I saw them target a Bitcoin company was in May this year — the same month they unleashed WannaCry,” Doman said in a statement shared with Bitcoin Magazine.The exchange that Doman was refering to is South Korean Bitcoin exchange Bithumb. Around that same time, WannaCry ransomware attacks were encrypting user’s computers and offering to de-encrypt them in exchange for bitcoin. Analysis of the techniques used in the WannaCry attacks show strong links to Lazarus.  Doman added, “They’ve also used related malware to opportunistically mine Monero coins on compromised servers. Clearly they have a large interest in cryptocurrencies as an easy method for economic gain, as well as an opportunity to economically weaken their enemies.”Although Youbit is one of the smaller bitcoin exchanges, the hack underscores the risk involved in leaving funds on an exchange, where control of those funds is handed over to a third party and is only as safe as whatever security measures that exchange chooses to use.Throughout the history of Bitcoin, hacks have amounted to painful losses. When bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox began liquidation proceedings in April 2014, the company announced that approximately 850,000 bitcoins were missing, an amount valued at more than $450 million at the time. In August 2016, the Bitcoin exchange Bitfinex announced hackers stole approximately 120,000 BTC, worth $72 million at the time.Following one of the largest hacks in the history of cryptocurrency, Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck has announced that it will comply with an order from Japan’s Financial Services Agency to improve its business operations.On Friday, January 26, 2018, Coincheck was hacked, resulting in the loss over over $530 million USD worth of NEM (XEM) tokens. A full transcript of the announcement from Coincheck executives can be found here.The core of the problem was that Coincheck was keeping the currency in a “hot” wallet, which meant the method of storage was connected to the internet. By contrast, U.S.-based Coinbase keeps 98 percent of its holdings offline in “cold” storage. The hack ranks among the largest of cryptocurrency since the launch of bitcoin. Coincheck subsequently restricted deposits and withdrawals of most currencies pending investigation and resolution of the problems.“We earnestly accept the terms of the order and vow to re-examine our business practices while simultaneously striving to make all facts involved in this case clear, discover the root cause of the breach, safeguard our customers, and develop stronger and more effective measures for system risk management and prevention of similar events in the future.”The exchange also announced a reparations policy yesterday, January 28, which will reimburse 523,000,000 XEM to 260,000 users.The hack caused an immediate 20 percent drop in the price of XEM to $0.79, but it has since recovered those losses and more, rising to $1.07 within 24 hours.Like Bitcoin, NEM is a cryptocurrency built on top of blockchain technology. Unlike bitcoin, which uses Proof of Work (PoW), NEM uses Proof of Importance (PoI) to establish consensus on the blocks. PoI uses “harvesters” in a variation of the Proof of Stake (PoS) model as opposed to miners used for PoW methods to generate tokens and does not require special computing or energy requirements to arrive at consensus. XEM is the name of the cryptocurrency associated with NEM harvesting and it is those tokens that were stolen from Coincheck.Vice President of the NEM Foundation, Jeff McDonald, told Bitcoin Magazine, “Coincheck contacted us immediately, so we knew about the problem and had devised a plan to tag the stolen coins before the news had even hit the media. The NEM technology is fully intact, so there is no need to hard fork the code.”McDonald said that NEM immediately reached out to the exchanges and identified 10 different accounts where most of the XEM tokens went. All of those tokens have been tagged, so anyone who is considering buying these tokens will be able to see they were stolen from the Coincheck exchange and should not accept them.“Had Coincheck used the NEM multi-signature wallet, this could not have happened,” McDonald added. “A third-party audit would have uncovered the problems, but Coincheck was the single exchange in Japan that was not FSA licensed and illustrates the value of good governance and oversight in this space.”Coincheck is expected to produce a written report summarizing the actions it will take to improve security and customer support by Tuesday, February 13, 2018.On Friday, February 9, 2018, Italian cryptocurrency exchange BitGrail announced that “internal checks revealed unauthorized transactions which led to a 17 million Nano [XRB] shortfall, an amount forming part of the wallet managed by BitGrail.” The shortfall when reported was allegedly worth $170 million and has presumably rendered BitGrail insolvent, despite the fact that the other wallets and currencies that the exchange has were purportedly untouched.The 9:30 p.m. UTC announcement by the Florence-based exchange gives some cause for circumspection. The founder of the exchange, Francesco “The Bomber” Firano, fired off salvos on Twitter in defense of the loss. His defense rang hollow for BitGrail customers, however, as Firano had noted the problem a day prior but withheld disclosure to authorities, users and the public while trying to work through the issue with the Nano team.The “Hack”?When news of the lost coins broke, BitGrail released a statement citing “unauthorized transactions” that were later confirmed by Firano to be the result of a hack. However, it appears many users have taken to Twitter to accuse Firano and BitGrail of committing fraud, with some positing that withdrawals have been severely limited on the exchange for months across multiple coins while transaction fees had increased. The coins lost represent approximately 14 percent of the total outstanding value of Nano mined.However, there is some dispute (discussed below) on what actually caused the loss of coins. Whether it was an error in the BitGrail system, a planned exit scam or a hack from outsiders, taking or keeping the ill-gotten tokens seems ill-advised. The percentage of coins taken represents five times the current daily trading volume of Nano and would require careful offloading to avoid driving the price down by selling the coins.Any scenario in which those lost coins could be dumped prior to the Nano coin gaining greater stability and trading volume forecasts a tumultuous time for the Nano team.Nano CoinThe Nano coin, previously known as RaiBlocks, is a coin with a low level of liquidity that only trades on a few exchanges, (previously) including BitGrail. At the time of this writing, CoinMarketCap lists the volume for the coin at $34 million over the trailing 24 hours. The XRB coin has spiked as high as $31.14 on January 2, 2018, and currently sits at $9.75. Nano hosted its first Meetup on February 6, 2018, and launched its iOS wallet in beta on February 5, 2018.BitGrail vs. NanoRelations between the coin and the exchange disintegrated over the weekend with Firano accusing the Nano team of libel and threatening to call the police “for irresponsible behavior,” while Nano retaliated in a “tell all” Medium post. In a de-evolution of relations, Nano core team member Zack Shapiro (in a deleted tweet to user @jsmoove08) defended BitGrail a day prior to the exchange’s announcement. The Nano team issued this announcement in response to the news. The team started with:From our own preliminary investigation, no double spending was detected on the ledger and we have no reason to believe the loss was due to an issue in the Nano protocol. The problems appear to be related to BitGrail’s software. We had no knowledge of BitGrail’s insolvency prior to February 8th.It concluded with this accusation:We now have sufficient reason to believe that Firano has been misleading the Nano Core Team and the community regarding the solvency of the BitGrail exchange for a significant period of time.Reactions from Firano were expectedly harsh, including one tweet where he stated:  In the wake of the unfounded accusations made against me by the dev team and of the dissemination of private conversations that compromise police investigations, BitGrail s.r.l. is forced to contact the police in order to protect its rights and users.It should be noted that the Nano team relayed through its Medium post that they would “not be responding to individual posts or accusations by Firano regarding this situation.”As BitGrail was one of the few exchanges that had been accepting Nano, the coin is now facing trading volume declines, down from the $50 million reported by the Wall Street Journal on February 10, 2018.Nano also linked a pdf of a private conversation between Firano and Nano core team members Shapiro and Colin LeMahieu. The chat shows Firano’s insistence that the loss of Nano was due to an issue with corrupted time/date stamps of the errant transactions and suggested the fault lay with Nano as non-Nano wallets remained intact. Shapiro and LeMahieu disputed this claim. Firano also asked if the stolen coins could be forked in order to recover the “stolen” Nano from the burned address. The dev team refused to acknowledge a fork as a possible solution.Firano stated in the chat that he first noticed the bug eight hours prior to the conversation with Shapiro and LeMahieu. Shapiro challenged Firano’s timeline, asking, “If withdrawals have been closed for the last month, how did you not notice this? Someone with[sic] allegedly withdrawing for weeks according to you via this ‘hack.’”Social Media ReactsUsers on social media seem to have sided with Nano on events, accepting the narrative that a bug in the javascript for the client-side interface allowed for wallets to withdrawal more coins than they had on the exchange. Others, though, were just as furious with the Nano dev team for supporting BitGrail in the weeks leading up to the loss of funds.Regardless of fault, the turmoil caused by the loss of $170 million worth of Nano on the BitGrail exchange has left both the exchange and the dev team faced with accusations, angry customers and little recourse for those affected.Identity verification is paramount to global freedom and citizen access to public services. We see many examples of this today in terms of how barriers to documentation adversely impact issues like democratic voting processes, especially among homeless communities and refugee settlements.Today’s developments in blockchain technology are now enabling solutions to these and many other verification issues. The use of distributed technology shows promise as a more robust, cost-effective mechanism for advancing identity trust and governance.Civic, a provider of blockchain identity-verification technology, recently announced a partnership with technology platform Votem to launch the first Know-Your-Customer (KYC) system powered by its CVC token. This, according to leaders at both companies, signals a major leap forward in ensuring the security and transparency of the KYC and accreditation processes.Votem’s platform provides citizens, organizations and governments around the world with the ability to easily manage or participate in online voting. It is designed to improve the effectiveness of voting by ensuring the integrity of the process, including the confidentiality of the voters’ choices and the validity of results, for both private- and public-sector elections.Through this partnership, Civic will provide Votem with trusted identity protocols, enabling a secure and transparent environment, without the risks and costs associated with collecting and storing personal identity information.An Early Use CaseFor Votem’s public token presale for accredited investors, which commenced on February 27, 2018, Civic is registering and authenticating the presale participants without the need for usernames and passwords. They are also verifying the identity of each person using blockchain-powered attestations.This process begins with users storing their identity documents using the Civic app. Civic, in turn, verifies the identity of each potential participant in the Votem presale and, where necessary, conducts advanced Accredited Investor checks for users in the U.S.Through the use of this new model, Civic’s decentralized ID verification and KYC protocol is laying the groundwork for security and professionalism in the token sale effort, ensuring that Votem’s process is secure from start to finish.Civic CTO Jonathan Smith said, “This collaboration marks another milestone for Civic’s ecosystem and for on-demand, secure and low-cost access to identity verification services. This partnership is especially impactful, not only because it is the first CVC-powered KYC, but because Votem also falls squarely in line with Civic’s long-term vision of bringing decentralized democracy to life through blockchain technology. With Civic and Votem coming together, fair and secure digital voting starts now.”Pete Martin, CEO of Votem, concurred: “We believe this will set a new standard for token sales and are honored to be working with them in this regard. We also think this sets the groundwork for a long-term strategic partnership around the secure and accurate authentication of voters since we share a common vision of making voting more secure, accessible and verifiable. Votem was founded to improve free and fair elections around the globe and with our partnership with Civic, we know that we have a solid partner to help us achieve our mission.”Orchestrating the Path ForwardIn a phone interview with Bitcoin Magazine, while navigating through the traffic gridlock in San Francisco, Smith said that Civic is very excited about this being the first KYC/ICO project that’s actually powered by the Civic token, a very important milestone for their platform.“Votem has always been very close to the heart and core of our mission involving the empowerment of democracy through blockchain-based identity. This project highlights the importance of identity as a fundamental building block in which voting can occur whether in a corporate system or an international government election.”  In light of Civic’s belief that democracy is a hugely important element in uplifting citizens, Smith noted that Civic has had conversations with various government entities throughout the world. “At the end of the day, the entity has to decide what and in whom they will trust. That’s a big thing to leap over — how do I trust the data I’ve been given? Blockchain [technology] is a much better solution in terms of facilitating a strong measure of trust in the KYC provisioning of an identity. Our partnership with Votem offers a great way to demonstrate this.”Blockchain identity verification platform Civic has emerged from Consensus 2018 with clear progress and updates for its identity attestation technology.The project imagines a network of validators and service providers who work together to verify individual identities. A new platform user would submit relevant identity information to a validation smart contract, which the validator would then review for approval. If approved, the validator would store references to this information on the blockchain, attesting to its validity. Anytime the corresponding user needs to submit identity information to another service provider (a bank, government agency, etc.), that service provider could request the validator to cross-check the user’s information with the blockchain’s attestations to verify their identity.In practice, such an ecosystem could streamline identity verification procedures and keep its users and participating service providers from having to go through lengthy ID checks whenever the occasion arises.Coming out of Consensus 2018, Civic is showing that it’s taking steps to turn theory into a reality. These steps include the first iteration of its ID codes protocol alongside its revamped token economy white paper, and — the kicker — the “world’s first crypto beer vending machine.”The idea of giving out free beer may seem kitschy at first glance, but its novelty is matched by what it means for Civic’s utility. Using the Civic app, anyone verified on the platform can scan a QR code to prove that they’re of legal drinking age. In a partnership with Anheuser-Busch, Civic unveiled the vending machine at Consensus 2018, offering anyone who used it a free brew.To Vinny Lingham, Civic’s co-founder and CEO, the campaign isn’t some flashy promotion or an excuse to crack open a cold one. It’s a way to prove that, without relinquishing any other ID information, Civic can utilize a zero-knowledge age check: a use case that could be applied to more than just alcohol purchases.“It’s a proof of concept,” Lingham told Bitcoin Magazine in an interview. “It could be beers, weed, pharmaceuticals — lots of things that are age restricted or are limited in access for certain people.”This proof of concept is just one of many uses for Civic’s ID protocol, the instruments responsible for such a practical application of the technology. Their newly released ID codes are another proven manifestation of Civic’s protocol, and according to the team, it’s the “first-ever blockchain-based verification mechanism.”While surfing the web, anyone will be able to use these codes to verify businesses, social media profiles, team members, advisors and any individual with attested information on the blockchain per Civic’s protocol. Lingham and the Civic team built these ID codes with ICOs and cryptocurrency projects in mind, wanting to provide a digital lie detector of sorts that will allow investors to steer clear of fraudulent projects.“One of the problems with ICOs is that all these advisors are fake, the investors are fake, the teams are fake, and so with Civic, now you can get verified,” Lingham told Bitcoin Magazine. “And you [the investor] can quickly look at the site to see whether or not the people are real.”These ID codes are the core of Civic’s mission, the nucleus of its composition and the feature that could potentially revolutionize how we, as a society, verify information for anything from job applications to vacation planning.“We have a ton of uses,” Lingham said. “It’s everything from verifying identities for authors, journalists, etc. … printing ID codes on your business cards, luggage tags: anywhere we want to put your ID information, or make it available to somebody, you can use a QR code from Civic.”All of this will be facilitated using the Civic app, and what’s more, users don’t need to even own any of Civic’s tokens (CVC) to use the services.“That’s the beauty of it. You don’t have to own a Civic token to use Civic. You just need the app.”Still, this hasn’t kept the team from revamping its token’s utility. With the help of Newtown Partners, a blockchain investment and advisory service co-founded by Lingham, they’ve also released a fresh token-economy white paper. The team claims that using game theory mathematical models and economic incentives, the newest version reimagines Civic’s Identity Verification Marketplace. Special focus was placed on demonstrating how CVC can incentivize use and circulation without providing monetary rewards or dividends, practices that have given regulators leeway to scrutinize tokens as securities, especially those with staking rewards.To avoid running into such regulatory roadblocks, Civic took pains to avoid any practices that might have made its token sale operate like a securities offering, such as coaxing investors with discounts and bonuses. “We looked at the way security sales are done and we did the opposite of everything they did,” Lingham explained.Lingham believes Civic’s token model and design could serve as an example for the rest of the industry to follow. To him, the end game is a practicality and usability that doesn’t just attract big league investors and entities; it’s a platform that acts as a “consumer-focused company,” because without everyday users, the technology will never mature beyond its growing pains.“We’re focusing on driving consumer adoption to this industry for identity and blockchain. Unless this technology gets in the hands of consumers and they can actually find practical use cases for it, it’s going to be a digital idea, not a device that gets used. So we’re very focused on engagement and building engaging experiences for users.”Cryptocurrency investigation enterprise Chainalysis is releasing a product called Know Your Transaction (KYT) designed to help businesses track customers that may be involved in illicit cryptocurrency-related activity. The company’s clientele includes the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Europol.Per a recent blog post, Chainalysis stated that it holds a lot of faith in both cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology:“Blockchains create new ways for people to build trust among themselves and transact using cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies have, in turn, inspired people to reimagine the financial machinery that powers world commerce. People are collecting land in virtual realities, conducting real-time payments for computation services, and buying collectible cats on the internet. This is just the beginning of worldwide access to financial instruments.”The venture’s primary goal is to get banks involved in the cryptocurrency scene and to create a world where financial institutions can offer their services to digital currency exchanges and ventures, but alleged fears of money-laundering make this somewhat tricky, which explains the reasoning behind the product’s release.Chainalysis’ KYT provides “real-time feedback” on transactions and fuels relevant information into what the company calls exchanges’ “transaction processing engines,” so executives can raise alerts regarding risky customers and monitor suspicious activity. The product has been in a testing phase amongst a small group of select customers, who reported seeing a “20X improvement in the speed of account reviews.” KYT will now be released to global cryptocurrency exchanges and financial institutions.In addition, the company is also introducing multi-currency support. Chainalysis will start with bitcoin cash for its law enforcement customers and is looking to expand to 10 cryptocurrencies by the end of 2018.Chainalysis recently landed approximately $16 million in series A funding from venture firm Benchmark, whose only other cryptocurrency-related investments include Pantera Capital and Xapo back in 2014.General partner Sarah Tavel, who led the deal with Chainalysis, explained that the move was a smart choice, and called Chainalysis a “meat and potatoes” company:“All these regulated institutions want to participate [in cryptocurrency transactions], but they need to understand with whom they are transacting and where their funds are originating. We’d solved these traditional compliance requirements in the fiat world.”Chainalysis was founded in 2014 by Oxford economist Jonathan Levin and Michael Granger, the former COO of San Francisco-based bitcoin exchange Kraken. The company employs over 75 people and boasts offices in New York, Washington D.C. and Copenhagen.Chainalysis rose to fame after it was selected to investigate Japan’s Mt. Gox debacle, which saw roughly half a billion dollars worth of cryptocurrency disappear practically overnight. The reported mastermind is an alleged Russian cybercrime suspect who was arrested in Greece last summer.Chainalysis isn’t alone in this space. London-based Elliptic, which also runs investigations relating to cryptocurrencies, has garnered over $7 million in funding from institutions like Banco Santander bank and Octopus Ventures to further expand its operations and product development team.MyEtherWallet, a popular web-based wallet for storing and transmitting the cryptocurrency ether (ETH), suffered a DNS attack that rerouted unsuspecting users to a Russian scam site into which some victims fed their login credentials.An unsigned SSL certificate warned users before entering the phony site but some bypassed the warning, resulting in a loss of funds. MyEtherWallet confirmed the attack in a statement on April 24, 2018.Hackers did not actually hack the MyEtherWallet platform itself but went after vulnerabilities in public-facing DNS servers instead. MyEtherWallet recommends users switch to Cloudflare DNS servers for the time being.DNS servers provide the correct IP address for an internet site’s name. If you type in “www.myetherwallet.com,” a DNS server will translate that into the IP address for that site. An SSL certificate protects against spoofed DNS answers by comparing the hostname you enter with the hostnames listed in the certificate. If no match is found, an SSL warning pops up.Normally when users attempt to visit myetherwallet.com, they are directed to Amazon Web Services, which hosts the site. But this time, according to cybersecurity firm CloudFlare, they were directed instead to a set of Russian IP addresses.According to Oracle's Internet Intelligence division, the hacker was able to hijack DNS entries after executing a BGP (short for Border Gateway Protocol) route hijack that redirected internet traffic meant for Amazon servers. BGP, a routing protocol used by the internet, is known for its vulnerabilities. Most of the affected users were employing Google’s recursive DNS service.“Little did we know this was part of an elaborate scheme to use the inherent security weaknesses of DNS and BGP to pilfer cryptocurrency, but that remarkable scenario appears to have taken place,” Oracle’s Doug Madory wrote in a blog post.DNS hijacks are not uncommon. Earlier this year, hackers hijacked the DNS server for BlackWallet.co, a web-based wallet for the Stellar Lumens cryptocurrency, redirecting $400,000 worth of lumens (XLM) to their own server. In late 2017, EtherDelta was also the victim of a DNS hijack, resulting in the loss of at least $267,000 in funds.With crypto scams running rampant across the globe, Human Trust Protocol, aka Hub, is joining hands with Civic, a blockchain identification service provider, to verify users via know-your-client (KYC) data gathered from the Civic secure identity platform (SIP). The new project entitled ICO Hub is an algorithmic ICO rating service that adds identity verification as a central rating factor: Hub representatives will now be able to identify ICO project team members and organizers to ensure a platform’s authenticity before investors step in.Launched by LinkedIn’s original CTO and co-founder Eric Ly, Hub works to establish blockchain histories and reputations by granting users blockchain-specific tokens which they can then add to a platform’s reputation data, thereby building its online market presence.Civic seeks to grant consumers a say in whether their identities are used in real-time by providing low-cost, on-demand and secure identity verification technology that boosts transparency and legitimacy in the crypto space. Civic uses a decentralized structure with biometrics on mobile devices, and provides multi-factor authentication without usernames, passwords, physical tokens or third-party involvement.ICO Hub is built on a specific rating system. ICOs will ultimately receive “trust scores” based on the authenticity of their organizers’ claims and users’ outcome predictions.In a statement, founder and CEO Eric Ly explained, “At Hub, our objective is to help users develop and manage their reputation data and incentivize meaningful and authentic interactions online through our human trust protocol. Civic’s secure and private ecosystem that enables decentralized, reusable KYC is a perfect fit, and gives our protocol users another means to bolster their reputation histories.”CTO and co-founder of Civic Jonathan Smith told Bitcoin Magazine that the Wall Street Journal recently analyzed over 1,400 digital coin offerings, and found that roughly 20 percent of them engage in some sort of fraud, from plagiarized investor documents to fake executive teams.“Within the coin offerings analyzed by the Journal, nearly $1 billion was poured into fraudulent investments, and so far, investors have claimed losses of up to $273 million,” he states.Both Civic and Hub believe their collaboration on ICO Hub will contribute to lasting trust in the blockchain space, boost users’ credentials on neighboring platforms, and improve transaction efficiency.“ICO Hub is the first algorithmic ICO rating system that, unlike qualitative analysis-based rating systems, will help companies more towards self-regulation,” Smith said. “In a time where crypto projects are under constant scrutiny, it will help users stake tokens and predict the outcomes of ICO projects, instead of relying on social and github signals. Having a strong ID verification service integrated in the algorithmic evaluation will enable Hub to significantly reduce the risks related to impersonation and fake personas that have plagued ICOs and allowed fraudsters to run off with money undetected.”Regulators have consistently worked to crackdown on fraudulent ICO projects. Last February, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a string of subpoenas to several ICO organizers, believing they were in violation of recent securities laws, and speaking with CNBC last November, Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin commented that most ICOs are fake, and have no intention of offering anything valid to their investors.The advent of smart contracts has long drawn interest for its potential to revolutionize business agreements. There’s just one problem, and it’s one that has affected many spheres of the cryptocurrency space: a knowledge gap. This gap exists between people who specialize in conventional legal terms and contracts and those who specialize in the technological programming of the blockchain.On a recent episode of The Tatiana Show, host Tatiana Moroz interviewed Hartej Sawhney, president and co-founder of the cybersecurity firm, Hosho. Calling in from the back of a taxi cab in Istanbul, Sawhney explained that Hosho’s business advantage has developed around overcoming the knowledge gap.“We see ourselves as a cybersecurity company that happens to focus on the cryptocurrency/ blockchain space,” said Sawhney. “What we’ve been doing to date has been building up a team of white hat hackers, people who have a strong background in the DevCon community.” For those unfamiliar with DevCon, it is considered to be one of the world’s largest and most well known hacker convention.Headquartered in Las Vegas, Hosho focuses on auditing smart contracts “on any blockchain” and simulating cyber attacks to test the security of different systems. In addition, Hosho is also developing other cyber securities solutions for the space such as a multi-sig wallet for Ethereum and a Telegram group bot that detects phishing scams.Fraud and MistakesSmart contract auditing remains the core of Hosho’s work. “Everything to date has been mostly people taking advantage of the fundraising mechanism of an ICO on the Ethereum blockchain,” said Sawhney. Auditing means that the developers are checking to make sure a smart contract is doing what it is supposed to do.Sawhney pointed out that auditing smart contracts has shown him that there is a knowledge gap when it comes to finding developers with competence in Solidity, the language used to write Ethereum-based smart contracts, who are then able to perform these audits. And, according to Sawhney, the other side of this problem is that those developers who are actually proficient at Solidity, for the most part, are “too rich to get out of bed.”Hosho’s strategy for dealing with the knowledge gap is finding people with cybersecurity backgrounds and teaching them Solidity.Essentially, to the public, projects with misfiring smart contracts fall under the category of scams.At EthBerlin, a gathering of 7–8 of the biggest cybersecurity professionals in this space will converge to standardize what a smart contract audit entails. Given the early state of the industry, Sawhney went on to say that the gathering, while sorely needed, is also well-timed for establishing an international framework for self-governance before one is imposed by an entity outside of the industry.While Sawhney stated that the knowledge gap is a real problem for the industry, he noted that standards were improving. “In North America, every single exchange has made it a standard to check for a professional third party audit. Asia has some catching up to do … The speed at which a cryptocurrency gets listed in Asia is a lot faster than anywhere else. This is also what makes Asia an exciting market.”The New StandardHosho’s standard for a smart contract auditing consists of a full audit of the language and code in their smart contracts followed by an itemized list provided to the client of all the quandaries that Hosho has identified with its capacity to be smoothly executed.After the client addresses the errors, Hosho provides a second audit to make sure that the contract’s code has been fixed. Once approved, Hosho, in effect, stamps the code to certify that the code has been audited by a third party: That seal is valid up until the point that the code is edited again.Although this seal is of interest to legal teams and government officials, Sawhney pointed out that, in the majority of cases, “the one person who reads our report is the exchanges.” This emphasis on exchange approval is tantamount to making smart contract audits a standard security procedure.Other TopicsLike Sawhney, Tatiana’s other two guests were concerned with establishing and maintaining standards within the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystems. In addition to Sawhney and his views on cybersecurity, Connie Gallippi described the journey of forming her Bitcoin nonprofit, BitGive, while Bitcoin Magazine’s managing editor, Christie Harkin, explained some of the rules for maintaining editorial objectivity in cryptocurrency journalism as well as some guidelines for successful news story pitches.One major class of attacks to hit the hacking landscape recently is cryptomining. While cryptomining on its own supports a good cause when being done consciously, it also allows nefarious actors to make a lot of money fast, and, with the sheer number of cryptocurrencies available to mine, it is becoming a popular choice for attackers.The technique essentially involves an attacker taking advantage of another person’s computer and using its CPU power to mine for cryptocurrency. If the malware is configured to consume a large percentage of CPU power, it can prevent the CPU from doing other tasks and effectively deny the user access to the machine and its application.The malware mining work is often done through mining pools, a collaborative framework which allows numerous “miners” to work together, thus increasing the amount of money the attackers can make collectively.So what can organizations do to protect their systems against this attack?Hitting the TargetAttackers try to exploit any publicly available interface that will allow them to carry out the attack. Such interfaces can include misconfigured services in the cloud like databases, caches, management tools like Kubernetes and more. For example, recent research from Imperva shows that 75 percent of Redis servers are infected with cryptomining malware.Having said that, web servers remain the largest target for attacker, since they are meant to be public.In fact, cryptomining has grown so popular that, in the closing months of 2017, there was a surge in attacks, where researchers saw that 88 percent of all remote code execution attacks (RCE) sending requests to external sources were trying to download cryptomining malware on target machines.To carry out cryptomining attacks, hackers will first look for an RCE vulnerability, which allows attackers to run arbitrary code on the vulnerable server. For example, a recent RCE vulnerability attackers used to mine cryptocurrency was related to insecure deserialization. In these types of vulnerabilities, attackers tampered with serialized objects that were sent to the web application. Then, after the object was deserialized, malicious code was run on the vulnerable server, which allowed the attacker to mine for cryptocurrency.Cryptomining attackers use similar techniques to other attacks in terms of infection, evasion and persistency. However, in some cases, we see malware samples that try to maximize the attack, and their profit, either by spreading in the network through vulnerable devices or injecting code to the server that affects the end users.In addition, cryptomining attacks can be a prelude to other kinds of malicious activity. If a server is infected, it usually means that it is vulnerable to some kind of a code injection. The same vulnerability that was exploited to infect the server with cryptomining malware can be reused to infect it with other malware or to launch further attacks on the attacker’s behalf. An infected end-point means that the attacker has gained a foothold in your internal network and that the attack can potentially spread to other machines in your organization.Although bitcoin is probably the best-known and most popular cryptocurrency, attackers are not mining for bitcoin; this is not only because special hardware is required to mine for this coin, but also because bitcoin transactions are not private. This means that coins can be traced back along the transaction chain, which means attackers have a higher chance of getting caught.As a result, attackers are instead increasingly mining for two types of coins: privacy-focused coins like Monero, and newer cryptocurrencies that require less specialized mining equipment. These alternative cryptocurrencies allow attackers to undertake transactions without the fear of it being traced back to them as an account balance cannot be seen, and the transaction does not reveal the sender, receiver or the amount transferred.Protecting Against Cryptomining AttacksTo protect against cryptomining attacks, organization should try to reduce their attack surface as much as possible,  limit public access to their assets whenever it is possible and enforce rigid authentication processes.Cryptomining malware usually needs a lot of computing power, thus a simple detection can be achieved by monitoring the CPU for high consumption. However, some cryptomining attacks are programmed to work under the radar. They are specifically configured not to overload the CPU, thus making them more difficult to detect.To protect against cryptomining attacks, organizations must first ensure their systems are fully up to date with all relevant patches. In order for cryptomining to be successful, attackers must first take advantage of a vulnerability. However, if an organization is up to date with all its patches, then this entry point is sealed.As attackers are targeting RCE vulnerabilities in web applications to launch their malware, patching is crucial. By ensuring IT teams are fully aware of— and ensuring systems are up to date with — the latest vendor patches, these kinds of vulnerabilities can be mitigated.Alternatively, virtual patching can also be utilized to actively protect web applications from attacks. This reduces the window of exposure and decreases the cost of emergency patches and fix cycles. A web application firewall that provides virtual patching doesn’t interfere with the normal application workflow and keeps the site protected while allowing the site owners to control the patching process timeline.Taking ActionIllicit cryptomining is an effortless way for nefarious actors to make money as it slips under the radar of victims. Plus, it is lucrative. The attack itself is simple to mount and is rapidly overtaking ransomware in becoming the most prevalent attack vector. Although some see this type of attack as simply a nuisance, cryptomining has the potential to cause large scale “brownouts,” as computer infrastructures collapse when criminals fight for compromised systems to get their hands on cryptocurrencies.This is a guest post by Nadav Avital, an application security research team leader at Imperva. Nadav has more than a dozen years of experience working in the computer and network security industry with strong technical skills in application security, hacking, operating systems (Linux and Windows), web architecture, Python and PHP. Views expressed are his own and do not necessarily reflect those of Bitcoin Magazine or BTC Media.On July 10, 2018, news broke that cryptocurrency wallet and decentralized exchange Bancor was hit with a hack. A wallet the Bancor team used to update the protocol’s smart contracts was infiltrated, and the $23.5 million vulnerability allowed the hackers to run off with $12.5 million ETH, $1 million NPXS tokens and $10 million of Bancor’s BNT token.Following the hack, the Bancor team froze the BNT in question in an effort to stanch its losses.The latest of its kind, the attack is an unfortunate reminder that smart contracts are not foolproof. Even built as they are on the blockchain’s security intensive network, they can feature bugs, backdoors and vulnerabilities that are ripe for exploitation.Before Bancor, we saw the popular Ethereum wallet Parity drained of 150,000 ETH (now worth just over $68 million) in July of 2017. In November of the same year, Parity lost even more than this when a less-experienced coder accidentally froze some $153 million worth of ether and other tokens.In perhaps the most infamous smart contract hack in the industry to date, The DAO, a decentralized venture fund, lost 3.6 million ether in June of 2016. The stolen funds are now worth $1.6 billion, and the fallout of the attack saw Ethereum hard fork to recoup losses.The Why and How: Making the Same MistakeIf three’s company, then The DAO, Parity and now Bancor have become the poster triplets of smart contract vulnerabilities. But they’re not alone in their weakness, and similar smart contract bugs have been exploited or nearly exploited on other networks.For such a nascent technology, such flaws may be expected, but given the mass sum of funds these contracts are supposed to protect, truly stalwart security measures are not yet routinely employed.To Hartej Sawhney, co-founder of Hosho cybersecurity firm, the sheer amount of funds at stake is enough of an incentive to attract black hats to these smart contracts, especially if there’s a central point through which they can probe for access.“There’s money behind every smart contract, so there’s an incentive to hack into it. And the scary part of smart contracts like Bancor is that they’ve coded their smart contracts in a way that gives centralized power to the founders of the project. They’ve put this backdoor in there,” Sawhney told Bitcoin Magazine in an interview.Sawhney is referring to Bancor’s ability to confiscate and freeze tokens at will, as the smart contracts that govern their wallet and exchange feature central points of control. This degree of control has been widely criticized as centralized to the point that Bancor shouldn’t be able to advertise itself as a decentralized exchange.And it may have even provided the hackers with an entry point into the network. While Bancor has not revealed the specifics of the hack and its execution, the team wrote in a blog post that “a wallet used to upgrade some smart contracts was compromised.” Sawhney indicated in our interview that “most smart contracts are coded to be irreversible,” while Bancor’s own are completely mutable. The hackers could have exploited — and likely did exploit — the same backdoor that the developers put into place to manage their project.Bancor aside, Dmytro Budorin, CEO of cybersecurity community Hacken, echoed Sawhney’s belief that the industry’s treasure trove of assets is a powerful impetus for hackers to dirty their hands. He also believes that the relative youth of the technology makes it vulnerable to detrimental exploits.“Coding on blockchain is something new,” Budorin added in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. “We still lack security standards and best practices on how to properly code smart contracts. Also, when coding smart contracts, programmers think more about functionality than about security, since a programmer’s main task is to simply make the code work, and security is usually an afterthought.”Working with new programming languages, security can take a back seat to functionality. More than just the casualty of a steep learning curve, Sawhney believes that security can slip by the eye of software engineers because they “don’t have a quality assurance (QA) mindset.”With millions at stake and potential holes in the code to exploit, hackers are bound to drum up a scheme to breach these contracts, according to Budorin. Even if a team has audited their code for expected or known vulnerabilities, “a new type of attack can be developed any time and nothing can protect you from this.”All it takes is a spurt of intuitive thinking to probe a smart contract’s code for an unexplored opening, Amy Wan, CEO and co-founder of Sagewise, iterated in a separate interview with Bitcoin Magazine.“It is not often that developers are able to write perfect code that works the first time around — and even when that happens the code cannot be adapted to unforeseen situations. Code is also static, which makes smart contracts very rigid. However, humans are anything but static and very creative when it comes to problem solving. This combination creates something of a perfect storm, making smart contracts ill-suited where there are bugs in coding or loopholes/situation changes.”Wan believes that “technology isn't about tech itself as much as it is about how humans interact with it,” meaning that we “are always going to have folks looking for opportunities to test the shortcomings of technology, which may result in hacks.”To Wan, smart contracts feature intrinsic vulnerabilities. To make security matters worse, she also holds that they “cannot be amended or terminated (or in technologist speak, evolved or upgraded),” and their static nature renders them susceptible to the dynamic, adaptive strategies of black hats.“Code aside, with every situation, there are an infinite number of things that can go awry. The rigidity of smart contracts presently cannot accommodate the fluidity of the real world,” she said.Mending the Achilles HeelIf technical flexibility is the crux of smart contract weakness, then the fix is in the inception and carry-through of their development. Developers should put preventative measures in place to ensure that their code can bend without breaking, the CEOs expressed.“We need to have a more comprehensive approach in order to solve this problem in the long term,” Budorin argued. “First of all, even though it is impossible to make all contracts absolutely secure, smart contract risks can be reduced. The best way to secure a smart contract is to have a security engineer on staff, conduct two different independent audits, and launch a bug bounty program for a dedicated period of time before deployment.”Hacken itself facilitates such bug bounties, and the platform, called HackenProof, has seen its white hat community audit and test such industry projects as VeChainThor, Neverdie, Legolas Exchange, NapoleonX, Shopin and Enecuum. Budorin and his team find that bug bounties provide a reliable if tertiary buffer for projects before they go public.“We believe that the only efficient way to mitigate modern cybersecurity threats is to host bug bounty programs on bug bounty platforms. This is called a crowdsourced security approach,” Budorin explained.“Bug bounty platforms attract a crowd of third-party cybersecurity experts (dozens if not hundreds at a time) to test the client’s software. Testing can be ongoing for months or even years.”Sawhney agrees that projects need to house more on-staff security experts to police vulnerabilities, while lamenting the fact that some projects lack a CIO or CTO for this effect. But he also indicated that, in some cases, companies need only to submit themselves to a proper audit to avoid a fate similar to Bancor’s.“Some of these companies believe that they have the world’s best engineers, so they think they don’t need an audit. And if they get one, chances are they’ve done a third-party audit that was in their favor. Even if they’re getting an audit, some of these audit companies aren’t doing what we deem to be a professional audit. They’re taking the code and putting it through automated tooling. They’re not taking the time to do some of the more manual tasks which includes a dynamic analysis, quality assurance,” he explained.The manual tasks that Sawhney lauds are at the heart of Hosho’s own auditing processes. They allow Hosho’s team to sniff out coding errors that automated tooling might miss, like discrepancies between the smart contract’s token algorithms and a white paper’s business model.“So the most manual part of conducting an audit is marrying the code to the words — we call it dynamic analysis. Most of the time when we find errors with a smart contract, we’re finding colossal errors in the business logic. We’re finding everything from mathematical errors to errors in token allocation,” Sawhney said.He went on to reveal that Hosho’s team includes professionals “from the infosec, defcon communities that are white hats who have spent years doing QA.” QA, shorthand for quality assurance, is a method by which coders test a code for its designed function to check for any malfunctions, defects and other flaws that may render it vulnerable or inoperable.As Sawhney indicated earlier, part of the reason these projects and their auditors don’t do QA is simply because they lack the professional experience to do so. It’s easier, he claimed, to teach Solidity (a smart contract coding language) to those who know how to conduct sound QA than the other way around.When lack of QA training or a learning curve isn’t the issue, however, Sawhney suggested that, at times, projects won’t secure a thorough audit because they’re simply cutting corners.“Sometimes I think it’s sheer laziness and being cheap. They see that cost to code a smart contract was only $10k and [an auditor] is charging $30k to review it. They say, ‘Nah, we don’t need that. We have the best engineers in the world so we’re good.’”To Sawhney, there’s no substitute for a thorough audit. He also holds that, once an audit has been completed, the smart contract should come with a seal of approval, one that both attests to the audit’s quality and reassures users that no code has been altered after the fact. For Hosho’s work, this comes in the form of a GPG file, a cryptographic stamp that simultaneously functions like a certificate of authenticity and denotes the final (or at least most recent) version of audited code, acting rather like the seal on a bottle of cough syrup that proves it hasn’t been tampered with since it last passed quality control.“Having central governments, regulators, lawyers, PR firms, investors, token holders — everyone — looking for this GPG file, this sign of approval [answers the question]: Has this code been sealed? Because we can monitor this code once we’ve put this seal on it to prove that no one has touched this code, not one line of this code has been changed since a third party audited it. If code changes you’re opening up room for security vulnerabilities.”Wan’s own solution offers a different sort of prescription, in that she adds post-audit safety nets like Sagewise’s software as a smart contract’s third line of defense.“Going forward, I believe that blockchain companies will be able to prevent smart contract disasters by using a smart contract developer whose sole focus is developing smart contracts, hiring a reputable security auditing firm, and including a catch-all safety net into smart contracts, such as Sagewise's SDK.”The Sagewise SDK integrates with smart contracts to police malicious inputs. It gives developers the chance to freeze the smart contract in question and adjust it accordingly.“It starts with a monitoring and notification service so users are aware of what's happening with their smart contract. Paired with our SDK, which basically acts as an arbitration clause in code, users are notified of functions executing on their smart contract and, if such functions are unintended, [they have] the ability to freeze the smart contract. They then can take the time they need to fix whatever needs to be fixed, whether that's merely fixing a coding error to amending the smart contract or resolving a dispute,” she said.A Community Problem, a Community SolutionIn our interview, Wan claimed that “[less than] 2 percent of the population is able to read code.” Fewer people still are able to read Solidity, let alone at the level needed to insulate it with airtight security features.So even if projects and companies want to take the measures necessary to vet and protect their code properly, they may be wanting for talent and resources. This problem will likely be educated out of existence as more software engineers develop a thorough, more sophisticated understanding of Solidity and other smart contract programming languages. More mature coding languages may present a solution to this ailment, as well.But for the time being, the community can help developers and teams to err on the side of caution. Like an arbiter with skin in the game, people using these services need to step up and demand action and change, Wan believes. Otherwise these types of security breaches will continue to happen.“[B]ecause much of the population cannot read code, it is difficult for them to hold developers accountable for when they do things like code an administrative backdoor into their smart contract (which many large projects have done),” said Wan.“Just in 2017 alone, half a billion dollars in value was lost in smart contracts, but that apparently has not been enough to get developers to consider adding additional safety nets or community members to demand them. Perhaps we will need to lose billions more to get people to realize that this isn't how the system should work.”Sawhney also reiterated this point: “[More] people need to be outspoken, call people out. I think people are scared because the community is tight-knit and everybody knows everybody. No one wants to shun people. There’s not enough self-governance in this space, and I think that’s the biggest step this community needs to take.”He added, “[not] enough pressure [is] being put on security; there’s not enough regulation around security.”In an effort to bring self-regulation to the forefront of the industry’s to do list, Hosho will partake in a summit for cybersecurity firms in Berlin. Slated for this September, Sawhney hopes that ETHBerlin will spawn a self-regulatory organization (SRO) from its attendence, “complete with a certificate for our work, kind of like the Big Four for financial audits.”Adding to the conversation on self-regulation, Budorin finds that the community would do well to document exploited vulnerabilities. This would create a library of case studies and situations for developers to study and to create the solutions necessary to avoid the same pitfalls in the future.“...the blockchain community needs to collect, store and analyze all known vulnerabilities that have been found in smart contracts and host regular security conferences that will cover security issues in blockchain and develop security guidelines so that new generation of blockchain programmers is more prepared for these problems,” he said.Both Hacken and Hosho are answering Budorin's call for security-centric conferences. Hacken is hosting HackIT from October 8-11, a cybersecurity conference that \"is all about bringing hackers and [the] crypto community together.\" In the same vein and in the same month, Hosho will host  HoshoCon, one of the first conferences to focus on blockchain cybersecurity. From October 9-11, 2018, community members will come together in Las Vegas, Nevada to listen to, learn from and discuss with each other what the industry could be doing better to bolster its security. While working toward proper security is a community effort, the onus is not on the community alone, as the lion’s share of responsibility rests on developers to ensure that their code is as sound as possible before reaching an audience. Together, however, the industry’s community and its architects may combine perspectives to make smart contract hazards an issue of yesterdays.Until then, Sawhney, Budorin and Wan’s perspectives — and their respective companies’ purposes — provide a healthy reality check for the industry’s pain points. For mainstream adoption and acceptance, these points need be addressed if there is to be any sort of sustained sense of confidence in this new technology.The Breeze Wallet with the Breeze Privacy Protocol public mainnet has been released and is now open to the public. The wallet showcases Stratis technology — a platform built for visual basic apps and blockchain solutions — and places heavy emphasis on both privacy and security for businesses seeking to implement business-to-business (B2B) transactions on the Stratis and Bitcoin blockchain networks.The Breeze Wallet was first scheduled for release in mid-2017. Designed as a bitcoin wallet for desktops, the application would come with TumbleBit — a promising privacy advancement built on top of Bitcoin — and give customers the opportunity to mix their coins without the need to trust one another or the receiving wallets.Speaking with Bitcoin Magazine last year, Stratis Founder and CEO Chris Trew explained, “We are integrating TumbleBit because it’s a trustless and secure solution that works with Bitcoin without any forks.”Based in the U.K., Stratis is a startup that offers end-to-end solutions for development, testing and deployment of blockchain applications. Aside from maintaining its own blockchain, Stratis also boasts a native token, the Stratis token, and builds tools for existing blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin.Developers claim the wallet boasts a user-friendly interface, along with what they dub the Masternode Client Discovery protocol, in which the Bitcoin or Stratis blockchain is used to discover, validate and connect to a Stratis Masternode. The process is decentralized and occurs through a trustless environment that is less vulnerable to network disruption.Users employing the wallet can “obfuscate” transactions, meaning they can render them obscure or unintelligible. This primarily works for ventures or individuals seeking to conduct on-chain business while preventing that business from being viewed by the public. If a company receives regular payments from customers or makes payments to a supplier, this would be deemed commercially sensitive information and would thus be shielded.Companies can also utilize the wallet to connect to a Stratis Masternode, thereby giving their transactions added protection across both the Bitcoin and Stratis networks. This is primarily done through TumbleBit, which provides anonymity by allowing several people to utilize the same payment channels. The channels are then protected with cryptographic puzzles that prevent any non-users from gaining access to the information they present.The Breeze Wallet is compatible with Windows 64-bit and 32-bit, along with Mac OS X and Ubuntu.Many people know bitcoin as an anonymous digital currency, one whose privacy features prime it for concealed payments in sketchy recesses of the internet’s dark web.These same people would likely be surprised to learn that bitcoin is far from anonymous. More pseudonymous than anything, its underlying technology, the blockchain, actually features a number of technical windows through which users could peep another user’s identity. These interested parties, be they analytics companies, governments or anyone with sufficient IT knowledge, can use peer-to-peer network analysis to link a Bitcoin public address to an IP address, allowing them to learn who owns a wallet and who they’re sending their funds to.In tracing transactions and public addresses back to their users’ IP addresses, these “spies,” also known as “adversaries,” are effectively deanonymizing users. An obvious breach of privacy, the Bitcoin community has long wrestled with solutions to neutralize this problem.Entering the conversation is Dandelion, a protocol developed by Giulia Fanti along with Shaileshh Bojja Venkatakrishnan, Surya Bakshi, Bradley Denby, Shruti Bhargava, Andrew Miller and Pramod Viswanath, researchers at Carnegie Mellon, MIT and the University of Illinois. If theory can hold up in application, Dandelion would effectively neutralize the peer-to-peer analysis that plays a significant role in compromising user identity.The ProblemWhenever someone sends a transaction on Bitcoin’s network, typically, that transaction is broadcasted to multiple nodes until it is picked up by a miner and included in a block.This broadcasting process is known as diffusion. It begins when the source node, the node that creates the transaction, transmits it to other nodes on the network. Once this node broadcasts the transaction, each of the other nodes that make up the network continues to independently diffuse the transaction by sending it to others with exponential delays.Presenting Dandelion at the Building on Bitcoin conference in Lisbon, Portugal, Giulia Fanti explained that the source node’s IP address can often be discerned because “diffusion is susceptible to detection.” When collaborating spy nodes receive a transaction, they can engage in peer-to-peer network analysis to retrace its steps through the network.Basically, by observing the timing of each broadcast and examining the structure of relays, spies can trace — with a high probability that isn’t necessarily foolproof — a transaction back to its source node. From here, the spy has high odds of gleaning the IP address of the transaction sender.Dandelion’s SolutionDandelion aims to abstract the transaction relaying process to make it more complicated for adversaries to trace transactions. This would, in essence, make it nearly impossible to follow the breadcrumb trail that broadcast timings and relay structures lead back to the source node that originally transmitted the transaction.To achieve this, Dandelion sends the transaction on a random path through a variable number of nodes before the transaction is diffused across the whole network. The random pathway is known as the stem phase of the protocol, as transactions relayed in the stage are shared only between one another, transmitting from one node to the next. The diffusion phase is known as the “fluff phase,” as the transaction is broadcasted to multiple nodes to be spread across the network (visually and in effect, both of these processes replicate a Dandelion’s anatomy, hence the terminology).In the stem phase, each node randomly decides to either continue the stem phase by relaying the broadcast to another node or diffuse the transaction to the rest of the network. If passed on, the next node again randomly decides whether to pass the transaction on or diffuse it. The transaction is passed along, one by one, until one node triggers the diffusion process.Adding the first transaction phase before diffusion is meant to provide an added layer of anonymity to the transaction broadcasting process. If the network passes the transaction to multiple potential source nodes before diffusion, this should, in theory, obfuscate where a broadcast came from, thereby making it exceedingly difficult to definitively trace a transaction back to its source.Dandelion’s GrowthDandelion’s proposal is considered to be a feasible step toward solving Bitcoin’s anonymity question that doesn’t involve overhauling its code entirely to outfit it with the kind of peer-to-peer network obfuscation tools a coin like Monero is developing, for example.The team is often asked why it won’t implement the same onion routing that Monero is focusing on. Fanti admitted in her talk that “Monero is addressing the exact same problem [Dandelion] is trying to solve,” but qualified this by stating that “implementing this is actually really time intensive,” as the Monero development team has been working on it since 2014.Focusing instead on its own ground-up approach, Dandelion has come some way since it was first introduced in 2017. After a peer review of its code found some glaring holes, the team revamped their efforts and re-released a new white paper with an updated method (known as Dandelion++) in May of 2018.It’s expected that Dandelion will be implemented into a future Bitcoin Core update, though it will not be ready for the forthcoming 0.17.0 release.Origin Protocol , one of the early initial token offerings listed on CoinList, has announced the launch of its new decentralized messaging service. Origin’s latest offering could challenge encrypted giant Telegram, which, while not decentralized, is widely used within the cryptocurrency community.Decentralized Options for Origin ParticipantsOrigin Messaging was designed to meet the need for a decentralized messaging system, not only for Origin, but for the entire ecosystem. The team believes this is a core service to their marketplace. In their words:“Messaging is [a] critical component necessary to facilitate meaningful transactions [between users].”Speaking with Bitcoin Magazine, Origin Co-founder Josh Fraser said the company is built on the belief that “buyers and sellers” should be able to “transact without rent-seeking middlemen.”He continued, “When you cut out the middleman, you also remove their fees, and both the buyer and the seller are able to get a better price. We’re passionate about promoting free and transparent commerce and giving our community a stake in the network.”The team has expressed confidence that a decentralized, encrypted, real-time service will best suit users. The Origin Messaging service was designed by leading research and development engineer Yu Pan, who is a co-founder of PayPal and a top engineer at YouTube.Origin engineer Micah Alcorn outlined the features in Origin’s blog post. These include an open-source framework and secure, end-to-end encryption. According to him, user privacy is paramount, and no one — including Origin and the National Security Agency (NSA) — should have the ability to eavesdrop on user conversations.The platform is also fully decentralized, built on top of OrbitDB, which is a serverless, distributed, peer-to-peer database that uses IPFS as its data storage and IPFS pubsub to automatically synchronize databases with peers. Furthermore, it is entirely free because though it leverages Ethereum’s infrastructure and signing capabilities, no messages are published to the Ethereum blockchain, which means there are no associated gas fees.He also lists speed, auditability, ease of use and anonymity as useful features of the new platform. Interestingly, the Origin dApp is ERC-725 compatible, which means users can create non-fungible assets that are used to verify the authenticity of the message recipient’s identity.According to Origin, “ERC-725 gives you a smart contract that you alone control. This smart contract represents your identity on the blockchain. You can attach as much identifying information to your identity smart contract as you want. You can also get attestations from other trusted third-parties like Origin that verify specific aspects of your identity and add those to your identity smart contract. You can see an example of this in action in the Origin dApp where Origin will verify information like your email address, phone number and Facebook account. After Origin verifies that you control those accounts, we will sign an attestation on your behalf that you can attach to your identity smart contract.”Of course, users also have the option to include no identifying information at all and choose to be known as nothing but an Ethereum address.Origin is not the first cryptocurrency project to pitch a decentralized messaging service. Obsidian, a fork of Stratis, for example, has launched its own decentralized messaging platform. Popular messaging app Telegram also had plans to decentralize its services by launching an ICO, though it took a step back from this plan in May of 2018 by canceling the public portion of its fundraising.In a what appears to be a seismic shift in company ethos, digital assets platform ShapeShift has launched a new loyalty program called \"ShapeShift Membership\" which will require the exchange users to provide \"basic personal details,\" according to a blog post published September 4, 2018.In his post, ShapeShift Founder and CEO Erik Voorhees said that the membership is part of a “loyalty program\" that will see the platform collect personal information from its users while rewarding them with a range of benefits, including higher trading limits, cheaper fees, early access to new coins and more.While ShapeShift has long been known as \"the exchange without accounts,\" with a model established to \"reduce friction and protect customers,\" this pivot seems to move away from the hands-off ideals that have distinguished it from other cryptocurrency exchanges.Voorhees said the change was influenced by three key factors, namely, user requests, an increasing interest in tokenization and regulatory hurdles, the latter of which, the founder claims, requires the exchange to be \"prudent and thoughtful\" in its approach.Regulatory authorities across the world have become firm with exchanges, as most countries now require digital asset platforms to comply with know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) laws before operating in the region.On the issue of privacy, Voorhees said his exchange still believes in the \"right to financial privacy,\" which he believes is a \"foundational element of a civil and just society.\"\"We still firmly believe that individuals, regardless of their race, religion, or nationality, deserve the right to financial privacy, just as they deserve the right to privacy in their thoughts, in their relationships, and in their communications. Such privacy is a foundational element of a civil and just society, and should be defended by all good people. We remain committed to that cause, and it is best served if we are smart about our approach.\"The membership program is currently optional, but there are plans to make it mandatory later this year. ShapeShift has set the wheels in motion to become an account-based exchange, but Voorhees assures users the firm has no plan to change its \"non-custodial model,\" meaning customers will still have direct control and ownership over their funds.As ShapeShift’s concessions demonstrate, financial privacy, a long-standing tenet for the crypto community, is gradually being eroded as platforms are forced to play it safe by aligning with regulators.Andreas Antonopoulos, regarded by many as one of the industry's leading thinkers and writers, commented on the news on Twitter:Just goes to show that any centralized entity will be pushed in that direction, which is why LN, atomic swaps and Decentralized Exchanges are the only way to resist surveillance economics.Based on blockchain technology, most cryptocurrencies have an open and public ledger. While this is required for these systems to work, it comes with a significant downside: Privacy is often quite limited. Government agencies, analytics companies and other interested parties — let’s call them “spies” — have ways to analyze the public blockchains and peer-to-peer networks of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, to cluster addresses and tie them to IP addresses or other identifying information.Unsatisfied with Bitcoin’s privacy features, several cryptocurrency projects have, over the years, launched with the specific goal to improve on them. And not without success. Several of these privacycoins are among the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market today.However, as detailed in this month’s cover story, Bitcoin’s privacy features have recently seen significant improvements as well and are set to further improve over the next months and years. This miniseries will compare different privacycoins to the privacy offered by Bitcoin.In part one: Dash.BackgroundDash (DASH) is among the most popular but also the more controversial cryptocurrencies in the space today.Originally a codebase fork from Litecoin (which is in turn a codebase fork of Bitcoin), Dash was launched by its founder Evan Duffield in January 2014 as Xcoin. The project was quickly rebranded to Darkcoin, seemingly in reference to Dark Wallet, a now-defunct, privacy-focused bitcoin wallet project. Darkcoin rebranded a second time in early 2015, to the current name Dash, which stands for \"digital cash.” At the time of writing, Dash claims a 12th spot on the cryptocurrency market cap lists, down from a top five spot for some time in early 2017.Much of the controversy surrounding Dash stems from the early days of the project. While the coin was not premined, it was instamined. As the cryptocurrency went live, miners created 2 million coins in a matter of days. Quite a significant amount, with a projected supply currently scheduled for a total of 22 million, and some 8 million coins in circulation today. According to Duffield, himself one of the early miners, the instamine was an accident. But instead of fixing the problem — for example, by changing the protocol rules or relaunching — it was decided that the coin would continue despite the instamine.Since then, Dash has turned into (what it calls) a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, and prides itself on being the first successful example of such an organization. The DAO centers around Dash “masternodes” — DASH nodes that stake (proof of ownership) at least 1000 DASH — and should help the network in certain ways, for instance by confirming “instant transactions.” In return, these masternodes receive 45 percent of newly generated DASH.Another 10 percent of every block reward is reserved for the Dash treasury. What happens with these funds is decided by the masternodes by vote. In practice, this money funds the Dash Core Group, effectively the company behind Dash, today headed by CEO Ryan Taylor.Additionally, this part of the block reward funds various forms of promotion of Dash but also some external projects, including Arizona State University's Blockchain Research Laboratory, a legal cannabis industry payments platform, and several initiatives in emerging markets.While once specifically marketed as a privacycoin, in recent years Dash did shift the focus of its pitch. Although privacy is still prominently featured on the Dash website and promotional material, it also emphasizes ease of use and low costs, apparently geared toward mainstream adoption. As a particularly notable deviation from its privacy-focused past, Dash even established a partnership with blockchain analytics company Coinfirm. While details about this partnership and the implications of it remain somewhat unclear, it’s not hard to see how this partnership is an odd fit for a coin previously known as Darkcoin.Which brings us to these privacy features.PrivacyDash actually offers one particular privacy feature, called Private Send. The Private Send feature is conveniently offered in a drop-down menu of the Dash Core full node client and in other Dash wallets.Private Send is really an implementation of CoinJoin, the privacy solution first proposed for Bitcoin by Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell. In Private Send, three users add their coins together in one big transaction, that sends the coins to freshly generated addresses belonging to the same three users. As such, the coins are effectively mixed between the three participants, breaking the blockchain trail of ownership between them. This process can be automatically repeated up to eight times, with (hopefully) different mixing participants, for extra privacy.Like any CoinJoin solution, Private Send does require someone to construct the CoinJoin transaction. This is done using Dash’s masternode system. Dash users that wish to mix their coins contact a random masternode, which then collects the coins from the different users, and mashes them together in the CoinJoin transaction. It’s important to note that the masternode cannot steal the coins.However, it does mean that Dash users must trust the masternodes with their privacy. After all, the mixing masternodes can link the sending and receiving addresses together; they know exactly which coins are going where. If these masternodes are run by spies or share their information with spies (on purpose or by accident), the Dash users gain less than nothing: They don’t have privacy, while revealing that they would have liked to have privacy.Granted, if a Dash user mixes his coins more than once, the odds should decrease that all mixing masternodes leak this information.* However, to optimize uptime (and collect block rewards), many masternodes appear to be run from virtual private servers that could be compromised relatively easily in one go, for example by government-sponsored spies. Further, many masternodes could be controlled by the same people (keep in mind that some 25 percent of all coins were mined in the first week), which means switching between them might not even help that much.It’s also worth noting that Private Send does require users to take the specific step of mixing, which in turn requires time, effort and comes with a (modest) fee. As such, only users who care about privacy are likely to partake in the mixing process; users who feel they have nothing to hide will not. This has the potential downside that mixing itself could be considered suspect. And while the trail of ownership is broken on the blockchain, the history of mixing is still visible.BitcoinBut perhaps most importantly, CoinJoin is not really unique. The technology was not only first proposed on Bitcoin, it is also available on Bitcoin. The most notable and powerful CoinJoin solution available today is Chaumian CoinJoin, which is embedded in the ZeroLink framework, which is, in turn, implemented in the Wasabi Wallet as well as the Bob Wallet and announced for Samourai Wallet.Similar to Private Send, ZeroLink lets users add their coins together in one big transaction, which sends all these coins to freshly generated addresses belonging to the same users. But importantly, and unlike Private Send, the mixer is in this case unable to link the sending and receiving addresses. Clever cryptography helps break the link, without needing to trust anyone.While Dash does, with its GUI-interface, offer a more user-friendly CoinJoin solution at this point time, the privacy guarantees are weaker than on Bitcoin — never mind serious contenders like Monero or Zcash. Needless to say, for a cryptocurrency that is, or at least was, promoted as a privacycoin, this is quite disappointing.Or as Maxwell — whose very own CoinJoin invention is used for Private Send — once described Dash’s privacy features: LOL.Based on blockchain technology, most cryptocurrencies have an open and public ledger. While this is required for these systems to work, it comes with a significant downside: Privacy is often quite limited. Government agencies, analytics companies and other interested parties — let’s call them “spies” — have ways to analyze the public blockchains and peer-to-peer networks of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, to cluster addresses and tie them to IP addresses or other identifying information.Unsatisfied with Bitcoin’s privacy features, several cryptocurrency projects have, over the years, launched with the specific goal to improve on them. And not without success. Several of these privacycoins are among the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market today.However, as detailed in this month’s cover story, Bitcoin’s privacy features have recently seen significant improvements as well and are set to further improve over the next months and years. This miniseries will compare different privacycoins to the privacy offered by Bitcoin.In part 3: VergeBackgroundVerge (XVG) was originally launched in 2014 as “Dogecoin Dark” by Justin Sunerok, who is still lead developer of the project today. To cultivate a more serious image, the project rebranded to “Verge” in 2016. As a codebase fork of Dogecoin, its base protocol is similar to Bitcoin in many ways. (Dogecoin was a codebase fork of Litecoin, which was a codebase fork of Bitcoin.)Verge has been in the news several times over the past year, most notoriously because the coin was successfully 51%-attacked on multiple occasions. But Verge is probably best known for its partnership with major porn site Pornhub, which made headlines all over the crypto media and beyond.At the time of writing, Verge (XVG) claims the 39th spot on altcoin market cap lists, down from a top-25 spot earlier this year. This makes it the fourth (and last) privacy-focused altcoin in the market cap top 50, after Monero, Dash and Zcash.PrivacyAccording to the subtitle of the the Verge “Black Paper,” which describes the project, Verge is “the most privacy focused cryptocurrency.” However, even the Verge project leaders themselves appear to be a bit more equivocal on this point. Describing (what seems to refer to) Monero as “too private,” the Verge Currency Beginner’s Guide written and published by Verge Currency Core members instead argues that privacy should be optional.This optionality is represented by Verge’s “Wraith protocol.” The Wraith protocol would let users choose whether they want to conduct a regular transaction (like a normal Bitcoin transaction) or a RingCT transaction, similar to Monero. RingCT transactions include “decoy” coins in transactions to obfuscate which coin is really being spent and also hides the amounts involved in a transaction for everyone but the payer and payee.However, RingCT transactions have actually not yet been implemented at this point in time. As such, Verge users can only make regular transactions.What has been implemented are optional stealth addresses. Stealth addresses are perhaps best understood as cryptographic puzzles. They essentially allow the sender of XVG to generate a brand new Verge address to send the XVG to, which can then be claimed by the owner (and only by the owner) of the stealth address. The main benefits are that several Verge addresses can be generated from the same stealth address and that the stealth address cannot be linked to the actual addresses on the blockchain by anyone but the payer and the payee. This means that the stealth address can be posted online, perhaps as a donation address, without the user needing to worry about his privacy.But Verge’s main privacy offering is probably a very different type of privacy: privacy on the peer-to-peer network layer.The peer-to-peer network, of course, is where nodes transmit and relay all transactions and blocks to one another. Unfortunately, this network can be spied on, specifically by deploying nodes to track the data it receives from other nodes. If done right, this information can be used to figure out where certain transactions originated. If spies can link this originating node to an IP address, they’ve gone a long way toward de-anonymizing the creator of a transaction.Verge counters peer-to-peer network analysis by having nodes and wallets communicate through Tor. By transmitting their transactions through the privacy-preserving, onion routing network, Verge users escape the prying eye of the spy. Tor is integrated into different Verge wallets by default, even including a mobile wallet for Android.BitcoinSince RingCT isn’t delivered yet, the only privacy features offered by Verge today are stealth addresses and Tor.Of these, only stealth addresses counter blockchain analysis — to some extent. This is a good feature, especially for some specific use cases (like donation addresses). But it is also a bit limited. Besides, simply generating a new (regular) address for each payment (which is standard in many Bitcoin wallets and also possible on Verge) and not sharing this address with anyone but the payer (which shouldn’t be too difficult) offers similar privacy in most cases. Further, stealth addresses are also available for Bitcoin (via Samourai Wallet).As such, Verge’s only real differentiator would have to be Tor integration. This is a well-established solution to counter network analysis, and the fact that Verge offers it by default is good from a privacy standpoint — though Tor can slow the network down a bit.However, Verge isn’t really unique in this regard either. Bitcoin can also be used over Tor, as can other cryptocurrencies. Granted, this does sometimes require some technical knack, which not everyone has. Verge offers a more user-friendly experience in this regard.Bitcoin is likely to adopt Dandelion, a recent proposal to counter network analysis. This solution doesn’t encrypt all network traffic like Tor does, but it uses a clever trick to obfuscate the source of transactions that goes a long way to achieve the same goal with less overhead. That said, Dandelion is not implemented yet.The much bigger problem for Verge is that network analysis is only one strategy to de-anonymize cryptocurrency users. And it’s almost certainly not the main one: blockchain analysis probably offers spies much more de-anonymizing data. As long as some addresses can be linked to real-world identities, address clustering tools can go a long way toward breaking all user privacy. In a world where a large chunk of all transactions are to and from KYC/AML compliant exchanges, protecting privacy on the peer-to-peer network alone probably doesn’t achieve much at all.Thus, at least until RingCT is implemented, Verge can not reasonably be considered a privacycoin on par with Monero, Zcash or even Bitcoin — if it can be considered a privacycoin in the first place. It is definitely not “the most privacy focused cryptocurrency.”When Tokyo-based Mt. Gox got hacked to the tune of 650,000 bitcoin in 2014, Japan learned early on the tough lessons of cryptocurrency theft. Yet, to this day, despite the country’s ongoing efforts to educate investors and ramp up oversight of crypto exchanges, it still feels the sting of hackers.On September 20, 2018, on the heels of the Osaka-based Zaif heist, which amounted to $60 million in losses, the country’s National Police Agency (NPA) issued a report of cryptocurrency thefts involving exchanges and individual crypto wallets for the first half of 2018. Japanese news outlet Asahi Shimbun was the first to report on the information.According to police authorities, during the first six months of 2018, cyber thieves made off with a startling 60.503 billion yen ($540 million) in cryptocurrency. Of the stolen money, 58 billion yen came from exchanges, while the remaining 2.5 billion yen was taken from individual crypto wallets.During this time period, there were 158 instances of theft — triple the number for the same period last year. In fact, the entirety of 2017 saw 149 breaches, amounting to losses of only $6 million.NEM coin accounted for the share of the hacked funds, with the majority being taken in the Coincheck breach earlier this year. Bitcoin losses of $7.66 million resulted from 94 breaches. Ripple (XRP) accounted for $13.5 million of the losses and 42 instances of theft.Finally, 14 cases of theft involved ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum platform, totalling losses of about $542,000.Sixty percent (102 incidences) of the 158 total reported incidences were due to individuals using the same ID and password for their cryptocurrency accounts as they did for email and online shopping — a no-no for anyone trying to safeguard online assets.Lessons were learned in the Coincheck heist. After the rattling event, Japan’s financial watchdog, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) kicked up efforts to bring exchange operators in line with newer security measures, brought on by laws that went into effect in April 2017.Between January 2018 and March 2018, 76 percent (120 cases) of crypto thefts were reported. After that, due in part to the NPA encouraging people to use better passwords, the number of crypto thefts dropped. And between April 2018 and June 2018, only 38 cases were reported.Tech Bureau Corp, the company that operates Zaif cryptocurrency exchange, received two warnings from the NSA this year for its lax security measures and is likely to receive another, as regulators do their utmost to reduce cryptocurrency losses in the country.Home › Articles › Brave Publishers Can Now Have Their Identities Verified with CivicBrave Publishers Can Now Have Their Identities Verified with Civic         Brave Publishers Can Now Have Their Identities Verified with Civic        Civic, a digital identity firm, has collaborated with Brave, the privacy-based browser with a blockchain-based digital advertising platform, to provide identity verification services to Brave’s content creators. Verified content creators on Brave now have the option of verifying their identities using Civic’s identity verification service in order to get paid Basic Attention Tokens (BAT) via their Ethereum wallets.Brave’s blockchain-based digital advertising platform is built on the strength of the Brave browser, which uses user attention as a metric for rewarding publishers with BAT ERC20 tokens. BATs are derived from user attention and can be used to “obtain a variety of advertising and attention-based services on the BAT platform.” Brave users can opt to anonymously reward publishers for content they find interesting by donating BATs through Brave’s integrated payment system.Civic is an identity verification platform that allows consumers to authorize the use of their identities in real time. Leveraging Civic’s Reusable KYC, Brave’s publishers will be able to verify their identities and ensure authenticity through the Civic App, which also provides customers with control over the use of their personal information.In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Civic CEO and Co-Founder Vinny Lingham said the partnership provides another “important use case for digital identity” as it allows Brave publishers to enjoy the convenience and simplicity of decentralized identity verification.“With rising awareness of consumer protection and data privacy issues, it’s great to see two privacy-focused organizations coming together and leveraging blockchain technology to find better, more secure alternatives for the future,” he concluded.Brendan Eich, the CEO and co-founder of Brave, also hailed the partnership with Civic, which he says would afford Brave’s publishers and creators the opportunity to “safely collect their tokens and get rewarded for their content.”According to Civic, its Reusable KYC allows users to “safely and securely verify their identities” on the BAT platform in order to receive payments without sharing unnecessary data.Having a digital identity that you can reuse eliminates the “day-to-day hassles of proving who you are,” said Lingham.“Civic’s identity platform is all tied to the idea of a decentralized reusable identity. Just imagine a secure, trusted digital identity that would be accessible from your mobile device, never stored in a centralized database, and accepted anywhere you go, from applying for a bank account to entering a bar to boarding a flight.”In the case of Brave, publishers who are Civic users can swiftly connect to the Civic App — which guarantees privacy and authenticity — to verify their identities on the Brave platform.Based on blockchain technology, most cryptocurrencies have an open and public ledger of transactions. While this is required for these systems to work, it comes with a significant downside: Privacy is often quite limited. Analytics companies and other interested parties — let’s call them “spies” — have ways to analyze the public blockchains and peer-to-peer networks of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, to cluster addresses and tie them to IP addresses or other identifying information.Still, unsatisfied with Bitcoin’s privacy potential, several cryptocurrency projects have launched with the specific goal to improve on Bitcoin’s privacy features over the years. And not without success. Several of these “privacycoins” are among the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market today, with four of them taking top-50 spots in coin market capitalization rankings.That said, Bitcoin does have some privacy features which, as this month’s cover story details, have been improving in recent months and are set to further improve in the near future. This miniseries compares different privacycoins to the privacy offered by Bitcoin and to the privacy offered by other privacycoins.In part 5: The upcoming Mimblewimble implementations Grin and BeamBackgroundIn the summer of 2016, a person under the pseudonym “Tom Elvis Jedusor” (the evil wizard Voldemort’s real name in the French Harry Potter novels) published a white paper, to be mysteriously dropped in a Bitcoin research chat channel. In it, he described a proposal called “Mimblewimble” (a reference to a Harry Potter spell), which presented a radical slimming-down of the Bitcoin protocol.Now, two years later, two projects are close to realizing versions of the Mimblewimble protocol, which will be launched as separate cryptocurrencies.The first project is developed by a group of mostly pseudonymous volunteer contributors, several of which are using Harry Potter-related screen names — like “Ignotus Peverell,” who started the project. They call their upcoming cryptocurrency “Grin” (yet another Harry Potter reference), which is being implemented in the coding language Rust. Similar to projects like Bitcoin and Monero, Grin will not be maintained by any specific company or foundation, nor will it do an ICO or anything of the sort; instead, the project accepts donations. Once launched, miners will be able to mine one coin (“grin”) per second on average, and (unlike Bitcoin) this rate will never decrease. Grin is currently being tested and is roughly expected to launch in early 2019.The second project was announced more recently and is called Beam. Beam is being implemented in coding language C++ (like Bitcoin Core). More comparable to Zcash, Beam will be launched and maintained by a for-profit company with the same name (currently headed by Israeli entrepreneur Alexander Zaidelson), though this maintaining role should later transition to a non-profit foundation. Beam will also have a founders’ reward: the Beam company and foundation will receive 20 percent of all newly mined coins for the first five years. It’s not yet announced what Beam’s emission schedule will look like, but (unlike Grin and like Bitcoin) it will be capped. Beam is also being tested right now and is scheduled to launch in December 2018.PrivacyMimblewimble combines versions of several cryptographic tricks designed for Bitcoin. In addition, it utilizes some clever math to completely strip down what typical blockchains look like.The first trick is Confidential Transactions (CT), which will also be deployed on Blockstream’s Liquid sidechain for Bitcoin. Confidential Transactions let users blind (or hide) the amounts that are involved in a transaction so that only the sender and receiver know how much money is involved. Using a cryptographic trick called the Pedersen commitment, anyone else can still perform math on the blinded amounts. This lets them verify that the sending and receiving end of the transaction equal out, and hence that no coins were created out of thin air.The second trick is CoinJoin, originally proposed by Bitcoin Core contributor Gregory Maxwell. CoinJoin combines several transactions into one big transaction, where all senders send money to all receivers. If done right, this obfuscates which addresses (“inputs”) are paying which addresses (“outputs”).In the Mimblewimble protocol, however, this is taken a big step further. By combining CT and CoinJoin with more clever math, Mimblewimble gets rid of traditional private keys, public keys and addresses, only keeping inputs and outputs (these are technically not the same thing as addresses). It also gets rid of the traditional signature per transaction, which is essentially replaced with a little bit of “excess transaction data” proving ownership of the coins.Interestingly, Mimblewimble miners take all individual transactions that would have been included in a block and instead turn the whole block into what is essentially one big “CT and CoinJoin on steroids” transaction.The end result of this “CT and CoinJoin on steroids” is something that seems alien compared to the standard blockchains we use today. Looking at a Mimblewimble block — a combined transaction of all transactions in it — it is completely unclear which inputs paid which outputs, and it is completely unclear how many coins were involved in any of the individual transactions. If enough people use Mimblewimble (more is better), hardly any trace of funds can be established at all, presenting a tremendous boon for privacy.Furthermore — and this is what arguably makes Mimblewimble truly special — the protocol design allows old and new transaction data to be cancelled out against each other. This allows for a radical form of pruning: most old transaction data can be forgotten. New nodes don’t need to sync to the whole blockchain, and the amount of data that nodes need to store should grow much slower than with typical blockchains.Where privacy features in other projects are often in conflict with scalability, Mimblewimble’s powerful privacy and scaling properties go hand in hand.WeaknessesThe innovative Mimblewimble architecture does come with some drawbacks. These include an absence of scripts (which makes blockchains programmable) and the requirement that wallets interact to create a transaction (no more sending money to address) — but both of these drawbacks can be worked around, to some extent.More importantly, in the context of this article, Mimblewimble does not, in itself, counteract all types of blockchain analysis. If implemented naively, Mimblewimble leaves room for a type of analysis of the peer-to-peer network that closely resembles traditional blockchain analysis.Specifically, a spy could deploy a node on the network that — like any other node — receives and forwards most (if not all) individual transactions. But — unlike any other node — this spy node would also record all these individual transactions. While all these transactions would subsequently be combined into a big “CT and CoinJoin on steroids” transaction by a miner, it’d be too late by then: The spy already knows which inputs are paying which outputs. (Though he’d still not learn how much money is moving around.)This problem is not completely unsolvable; the Beam project has made some suggestions already. But it’s also not completely solved.One proposed solution is to combine transactions between users even before they hit the network, similar to CoinJoin-related privacy solutions on Bitcoin. This would help the users involved, but it would also face a drawback similar to that on Bitcoin: Those users who feel they have “nothing to hide” may not want to bother with the added hassle. This, in effect, weakens privacy for all and could even raise suspicion for those that do use it.A second proposal is to add “dummy” outputs to transactions, containing zero coins. By (automatically) spending the dummy outputs in a later block, this obfuscates where the money really moved to. This maneuver also comes at an increased cost, however, once again risking that not everyone will use it. (On the upside, it wouldn’t hurt Mimblewimble’s long-term scalability because such transaction data would cancel out and disappear.)A third proposal is to aggregate transactions as they are spread over the network, potentially combined with a Dandelion-type of peer-to-peer obfuscation technique.* If nodes keep adding all the transactions they know about into a big CoinJoin-like transaction before forwarding it, a “snowball effect” would make it exceedingly hard for spies to learn anything useful. This solution is quite challenging to implement, however, and introduces several new problems. (But it can be combined with the dummy output solution, further benefiting the potential of both.) All this brings us to Mimblewimble’s biggest and most obvious “weakness”: Grin and Beam are still works in progress. The potential of the Mimblewimble protocol is very promising, but much depends on the specific implementations, making it impossible to say exactly how strong the privacy guarantees of these projects will be and how this will compare to Bitcoin and other privacycoins.Brendan Eich, the CEO of Brave, has written a letter to the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation urging them to implement GDPR-like legislation in the United States.GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation and works to secure the data and privacy of all individuals within the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA). In addition, it addresses the exporting of personal data outside these two organizations. GDPR seeks to give individuals control over their personal information and simplify the regulatory atmosphere for international business ventures.Based in San Francisco, Brave is a new kind of browser that allegedly offers users faster speeds and stronger security by blocking trackers and advertisements. In his letter, Eich describes GDPR as a “great leveler” and says it has allowed many new businesses in Europe to flourish by preventing larger, more established corporations from disadvantaging them.“The GDPR’s principle of ‘purpose limitation’ will begin to prevent dominant platforms from using data that they have collected for one purpose at one end of their business to the benefit of other parts of their business in a way that currently disadvantages new entrants,” Eich writes.“In general, platform giants will need ‘opt-in’ consent for each purpose for which they want to use consumers’ data. This will create a breathing space for new entrants to emerge.”Eich says GDPR-like standards have been adopted in several countries around the world including China, Brazil, Japan, India, South Korea and Argentina. Together, these countries make up roughly 51 percent of the world’s overall GDP and have experienced higher levels of efficiency and innovation in their business markets.Eich believes that should the U.S. move in a similar direction, the country can keep its competitive edge and affirm its reputation as a leading global tech hub.Furthermore, he suggests that GDPR-like protocols will establish greater trust within the United States between businesses and customers, as it is not necessary to track people’s movements online: the main reason for doing so is simply to generate ad-based revenue from the sites customers visit. Since late 2017, approximately 615 million devices built to block ads and tracking have been activated, suggesting a growing level of unease and distrust amongst everyday consumers.“A GDPR-like standard in the United States will establish the foundation of trust to enable innovation and growth,” he writes. “This certainly applies in our own online media and advertising industry. Contrary to some of our industry colleagues, I believe that it is not tenable for any platform, publisher, technology vendor or trade body to claim that they must track people to generate revenue from advertising … Trust will only return as the GDPR-like laws begin to curtail the online advertising industry’s worst practices.”Tracking movements to garner ad revenue occurs through a process known as online behavioral advertising (OBA). Data is collected from all the sites a consumer visits. Ads are then selected for display to the consumer based on his or her past maneuvers. Eich says OBA occurs via several third-party networks operating quietly through “opaque processes” with no central authority to be held accountable. In other words, this is a form of “behavioral tracking,” and he questions how ethical and safe it really is.Recently, Eich filed privacy complaints in both Britain and Ireland against internet giant Google for playing “fast and loose” with customers’ private data. In his initial complaint, Eich said that Google offers intimate data about its consumers to several hundred companies without their knowledge to auction and place ads. He claims this goes against GDPR requirements that personal data be processed in a way that all consumers remain secure.In addition, Facebook was at the height of scandal earlier this year when it was revealed that data firm Cambridge Analytica had gathered private information on millions of social media users without their knowledge and used it for political purposes. Cases like these are suggestive that tech companies have garnered too much power, and user data is usually under threat of being compromised.Interestingly, GDPR also offers a “right to erasure” clause, in which a subject’s collected data is immediately erased from a company’s records granted the information was gathered unlawfully, is no longer needed, or the subject in question withdraws consent for the data to be used. This could present issues for blockchain-based companies, as all information on the blockchain is recorded in real-time to ensure irrefutable evidence of transactions and other relevant data.At the same time, one of the primary requests among investors who engage in crypto-transactions via the blockchain is improved privacy and anonymity. Heightened usage of privacycoins like Monero and Zcash are proof of this, which means statutes similar to those of GDPR could be in line with the ideologies of privacy-focused blockchains.GDPR is based on standards the United States initially endorsed back in 1980 through legislation known as the OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data. This legislation included a definition of the term “personal data” similar with that offered by GDPR. Also, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been fighting for GDPR-like features for over 10 years.Brave as a company stands to gain little, if anything, directly from GDPR-like legislation being implemented in the United States. While the Brave browser protects user privacy and restricts advertisements, GDPR-like legislature would simply push forward what Eich and his company already believe: users deserve privacy over their online data. Eich’s letter reiterates that societies around the world are shifting toward a paradigm with a level playing field on the internet and that the United States should follow suit.Most digital exchanges are unregulated and therefore unqualified to safely process cryptocurrency transactions. They don’t employ necessary know-your-customer (KYC) tactics, and roughly $1 billion in digital asset funds have been stolen since the start of 2018.These are the unsettling claims made by a new report released by blockchain and virtual currency forensics firm CipherTrace.The most popular target currency still appears to be bitcoin, and one of the document’s key findings is that roughly 97 percent of bitcoin used in illegal transactions or that stem from criminal activity are sent to unregulated digital exchanges that enforce weak anti-money laundering (AML) tactics. An exchange is considered lacking in AML mechanisms if it does not regulate illegal drug dealing, maintain records over time, report suspicious or large transactions, or enforce KYC regulations, the report details.In addition, nearly 5 percent of all bitcoins received by unregulated exchanges come from criminal transactions, and some of the world’s top exchanges have laundered as much as $2.5 billion in BTC.To uncover these findings, researchers at CipherTrace examined over 45 million cryptocurrency transactions through roughly 20 of the world’s largest and most dominant exchanges. A transaction was marked as “criminal” if it came from a dark market website or through means of extortion, ransomware, malware or terrorist financing.To fully comprehend the damage, the authors also examined crypto funds reported stolen in 2017 to see if the last nine months have been more devastating. According to the report, over $900 million of the more than $1 billion reported stolen in 2018 was taken in just the first three quarters of this year, meaning that the amount of theft has more than tripled since last year.However, most of these losses can ultimately be blamed on the massive Coincheck hack that took place in January. That one theft was large enough to account for more than half of the reported losses in CipherTrace’s study. Other major hacks that occurred throughout 2018 include those on South Korean exchanges Bithumb ($30 million) and Coinrail ($40 million), as well as Japan-based Zaif ($60 million).While the document discusses several methods of crypto theft, the most common one appears to be phishing, in which mass, customized extortion occurs through email and other electronic means to garner cryptocurrency-based ransoms. Other common methods include advanced malware and targeting employees of cryptocurrency exchanges directly.The report also mentions SIM swapping. Though the report indicates that this is still a relatively new method of theft, SIM swapping is an insidious process by which a victim’s phone number is transferred to a thief’s SIM card. The thief then uses the number to change passwords and access the victim’s accounts.Researchers also mention many of the regulatory actions taken against crypto-hackers, many of which have occurred in the third quarter. Among the most prominent are AMLD 5, which was passed by the European Commission on July 9, 2018. The new ruling states that by January 20, 2020, all AML and counter terrorism funding (CTF) laws presently applied to banks and traditional financial institutions will also apply to digital currency platforms. AMLD 5 also enforces identity checks for every new customer.In addition, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is looking to apply all its present standards designed for traditional monetary establishments to virtual currencies by the end of June 2019. It is also seeking to ensure these standards are implemented in every nation. Currently, there are several countries that the FATF classifies as “rogue states,” or regions that deny compatibility with FATF goals and refuse to cooperate. These include Syria, Pakistan, Iran, Tunisia and Yemen among others.However, the authors do take note of several countries working to instill appropriate regulation of virtual currencies and blockchain businesses. Two that really stand out are Malta and Canada, the former having established several licensing requirements for initial coin offerings (ICOs) and similar funding ventures scheduled to go into full effect on November 1.Canada is also seeking to bring crypto regulation to new heights by requiring payment processors and digital currency exchanges be treated as money service businesses (MSBs). This will require stronger KYC rules for all crypto-related business. Should this law pass, it will go into effect in late 2019.North Korean cybercrime hacking group The Lazarus Group is currently the biggest crypto hacking syndicate in the world, having stolen millions worth of cryptocurrencies from online exchanges. Also known as HIDDEN COBRA, which works at the behest of the North Korean government, the Lazarus Group has been responsible for some of the world's largest cyber attacks including the Sony hack in 2014, the Wannacry ransomware outbreak, military espionage and a number of attacks on South Korean businesses.In a report acquired by news outlet HardFork, cybersecurity outfit Group-IB outlines trends in hi-tech cybercrime, detailing 14 different attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges since January 2017. It suggests that Lazarus has been responsible for the disappearance of over $571 million in cryptocurrency.What is most interesting about the data from Group-IB is that a large majority of the targeted exchanges are domiciled in South Korea, such as Bithumb, YouBit and Coinrail.This data appears to confirm accusations made by a member of South Korea’s parliamentary intelligence committee that the North Korean government has stolen cryptocurrency worth billions of won last year from South Korean exchanges.Hackers who target cryptocurrency exchanges favor traditional methods and tools such as spear phishing, social engineering and malware. According to the cybersecurity group, hackers were able to steal 10 percent of the total funds raised by initial coin offering (ICO) platforms over the past year and a half, with 50 percent of the funds lost to phishers.Cybercriminals can create fake web pages, simulating the real project, tricking investors who are desperate to jump in on the next big thing. The report notes that large phishing groups have become so skilled in their craft, they can steal as much as $1 million in a day.One incident that stands out was the creation of phishing sites for Telegram's ICO project, which allowed the thieves to scam would-be investors of Telegram's ICO. Gramtoken.io was the most prominent fake website during that period. It built authenticity by stealing details from Telegram's white papers, project roadmap and more.Phishing schemes can also take the form of investor database theft which hackers can resell on the darknet or use to blackmail crypto holders.While attacks on ICOs might have dwindled in the wake of the clampdown by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Group-IB believes the previous attacks on ICOs remain a threat for any crypto project that attracts investors. The group also predicts that phishing scams won't go away anytime soon, but they will become harder to detect as fraudsters unveil new tricks and tools to perpetrate their crimes.“Fraudulent phishing-schemes involving crypto-brands will only get more complex as well as cybercriminals’ level of preparation for phishing attacks,” the report warns. “Automated phishing and the use of so-called ‘phishing-kits’ will become more widespread, including for the attacks on ICOs.”The cybersecurity group sees a future where state-sponsored hackers, like the Lazarus Group, could target large mining pools, as 51-percent attacks seem to be on the increase.“In 2017, no successful 51-percent attacks were detected, but they are now [happening] more often. In the first half of 2018, five successful attacks were registered with direct financial losses ranging from $0.55 million to $18 million,” the report concluded.After the recent hard fork upgrade of its protocol, Monero has seen its transaction fees shrink by approximately 97 percent, dropping from 60 cents to just 2 cents. Crypto analytics firm Coinmetrics shared a tweet confirming the drop in fees and their corresponding reduction in transaction size, falling from 18.5kb pre-fork to 3kb — an 80 percent change.The upgrade, called “Monero 0.13.0 Beryllium Bullet,” implements \"bulletproofs.” First introduced by researchers at Stanford, the cryptographic scheme shrinks the size and cost of transactions specifically for Confidential Transactions.  Why Bulletproofs?As stated above, Bulletproofs are a scaling complement to Monero’s Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT), Monero's main privacy feature, which uses a combination of ring signatures and Confidential Transactions. Ring signatures are cryptographic digital signatures that protect a user's privacy in the input side of a transaction by making it nearly impossible to determine who the actual signer of a transaction is.To achieve this privacy, each Monero transaction includes additional, extraneous coins (decoys) to mask the exact coin being signed, making it extremely difficult to parse the real coins being sent from the decoys. Before the upgrade, six decoys were added to each Monero transaction--now, ten will be featured in each.Bolstering the privacy provided by ring signatures, Confidential Transactions let users hide the amount exchanged in a transaction by leveraging a cryptographic trick dubbed the Pedersen commitment.While the RingCT format makes transactions more private, it also makes the system less scalable than other cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin. Bulletproof shrinks the size of the cryptographic proof, which cuts the transaction size drastically. While Monero can't get rid of old transaction data, which is currently above 20 gigabytes and growing — out of a total 60 gigabytes — the recent upgrade ensures the network now requires less storage space for transactions than it used to.Season 2 of Distributed Dialogues has begun, and a general theme will be the connection of major, real-world problems to possible solutions using blockchain technology. This is displayed in full on the first episode, which combines a historical context on Cambodian state repression with ways in which promising new technologies may bring new freedom of the press.Like many aspects of the transition from French Indochina to independent states, alongside all the wars and U.S. interventions, it becomes difficult to fully understand the historical context. To help the audience understand how Cambodia got where it is today, Distributed Dialogues interviewed veteran journalist David Andelman. Andelman covered the Cambodian Civil War in the ’70s, and came close enough to the front lines to find himself encircled by the Khmer Rouge. Using his wide breadth of knowledge and personal investment in this conflict, Andelman gives listeners a vivid and straightforward background on the state of affairs.As for the current political repression in Cambodia, exiled Member of Parliament Mu Sochua came onto the show to discuss the ban of the nation’s opposition party, her exile from Cambodia and the state of affairs today. Sochua escaped a purge of this opposition party that found many leaders imprisoned. She is now a permanent resident of France and advocate for Cambodian freedom. Despite witnessing some of the horrors of life under the Khmer Rouge and its successors, Sochua remains resolute, stating, “As we try to rebuild a nation that’s been totally destroyed by violence, death, and mass murder, we have to also look to what is rich in our society, our culture.”Tying the episode together, Mounir Ibrahim discusses the ways that blockchain technology can intervene in the oppressive state’s stranglehold over the flow of information. Inspired by his work in the sState dDepartment in Syria and by the Arab Spring, Ibrahim was drawn to the power of a trustless, decentralized system for its ability to let citizens verify news themselves. His company, Truepic, verifies the authenticity of pictures taken on an in-app camera, encrypts all associated metadata, makes sure that the phone’s operating system has not been tampered with and stores pictures on a blockchain. By doing this, he believes that any concerned citizen with a smartphone can document public atrocities committed by authoritarian regimes and provide an alternative to state-run media.These three guests provide a nuanced picture of autocracy, from its fledgling steps to its actions after decades in power. Using blockchain verification can be a possible way for people to push back against these actions in the present day; this will be a recurring theme throughout the episodes of Distributed Dialogues Season 2. Look for future exploration in the world of blockchain and authoritarianism on the Let’s Talk Bitcoin Network.Google Ventures-backed Blockchain is debuting a hardware wallet that integrates with its software services, a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine details.In a partnership with hardware wallet manufacturer Ledger, the cryptocurrency software company has developed what it calls “a custom hardware device.” Dubbed the Blockchain Lockbox, the wallet, like Ledger’s own suite of products, will allow users to store their private keys offline in the device. This practice, referred to as cold storage, is considered a safer alternative to hot storage, wherein private keys are held in software connected to the internet.According to the release, existing Ledger users “will be able to pair their Nano S devices” to the Lockbox, and a representative told Bitcoin Magazine that \"it will also facilitate crypto-to-crypto trades through Blockchain’s native brokerage, Swap.\" When asked which coins the wallet would support, the representative said that \"Lockbox will mainly support Bitcoin, Ether and Bitcoin Cash. Though, the teams are in the works to add support for additional asset depending on user demand.\"“We’re thrilled to offer the Lockbox to Blockchain users so they can easily manage their funds online and offline seamlessly,” Peter Smith, CEO and co-founder of Blockchain, said in the release.The wallet will interface directly with Blockchain’s software wallet, and it will be exclusively compatible “only with Blockchain’s software,” a Blockchain representative told Bitcoin Magazine. This will allow users to manage their hardware wallet’s holdings using the software, while also offering what Smith calls “more functionality than previously existed” by giving users the flexibility to transfer funds back and forth from the Lockbox to Blockchain’s software wallet.Ledger’s president, Pascal Gauthier, called the partnership “a natural fit,” stressing the importance both companies — and the crypto community at large — place on cyber security.“With stories about crypto hacking continuing to dominate headlines, it’s obvious that security must be top of mind for all stakeholders in the crypto space. With the combined forces of Blockchain and Ledger, users are truly getting the best of both worlds,” he said.Though seemingly hyperbolic, Gauthier isn’t exaggerating when he says hacks “dominate headlines.” The first month of 2018 saw the biggest hack in the industry’s history since Mt. Gox, and Japan alone has suffered over half a billion dollars worth of losses this year.The hardware wallet is open for preorders today, October 25, 2018, with delivery slated for mid-November, and the press release indicates that early customers will receive a “special edition blue version” of the wallet.Civic has entered into a tripartite agreement with cybersecurity protection solution company, Rivetz, and Telefónica's cybersecurity unit, ElevenPaths, to provide secure identity verification that incorporates added hardware protections for mobile users.With presence in five countries, Civic uses blockchain technology to secure and protect the transfer of personal information, while allowing people to decide how they share their information.In correspondence with Bitcoin Magazine, Steven Sprague, CEO of Rivetz, called Civic's integration into the partnership as a \"pivotal step toward providing the digital identity we need in today’s world.\"In May 2018, Spanish telecom giant Telefónica partnered with Rivetz to develop decentralized security solutions for mobile users aimed at improving cybersecurity controls and protections for secure messaging and cryptocurrency wallets.Rivetz's security solutions will leverage the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), a hardware vault built into mobile phones for enhanced security. These solutions will be built into smartphones and supplemented with a secured Subscriber Identity Module (SIM), provided by Telefónica. The intention is to secure the private keys of users, even if the operating system is tampered with or infected by malware.Civic's inclusion will make it possible for Telefónica's users to verify their identity in real time and separate locally stored personal information from the private key needed to sign transactions on the blockchain. Rather than having all details stored locally in one place, on the Civic App, Civic will store the private keys in the TEE, provided by Rivetz. The user's personal information will remain in the Civic App, which is protected by biometrics and high-level encryption.CEO and Co-Founder of Civic Vinny Lingham sees the partnership as “a massive step.”“Blockchain technology is transforming the way companies approach privacy and security,” he said to Bitcoin Magazine. “Our partnership with Rivetz and Telefónica is a reflection of that transformation, ensuring that digital identity and mobile security solutions go hand-in-hand.”Lingham added, “As identity information is increasingly vulnerable, we’re working with like-minded companies to create the most effective, most secure identity solutions that protect people’s privacy, without requiring their data to be collected and stored.”In a bid to lower the barriers to mainstream adoption of blockchain technology, professional services giant Ernst & Young (EY) has launched a solution that it claims will allow companies to transact privately on Ethereum’s blockchain using zero-knowledge proof (ZKP).Dubbed the EY Ops Chain Public Edition (PE), the solution will reportedly allow enterprises to issue and sell product tokens on a “public blockchain with private access to their transaction records.” This announcement comes on the heels of EY’s launch of the EY Ops Chain, a set of apps and services created to help businesses commercialize the use of blockchain technology.With millions of users and a market cap of approximately $20 billion, Ethereum's blockchain is larger than most private blockchains, but its ecosystem’s size, which comes with a plethora of smart contract applications and tokens, also requires a considerable amount of computational power to operate it, as well as less transaction privacy than private blockchains. According to the report, EY Ops Chain PE will offer the best of both worlds.In an email correspondence with Bitcoin Magazine, Paul Brody, EY global innovation leader of blockchain technology, stated:“EY Ops Chain PE is a first-of-its-kind application and a major step forward that empowers blockchain adoption. Private blockchains give enterprises transaction privacy, but at the expense of reduced security and resiliency.”The new EY Ops Chain PE uses ZKP technology to enable the transfer of private tokens without tampering with Ethereum’s consensus algorithm. Developed by the EY blockchain labs in Europe, with patents pending in the United Kingdom and France, the prototype system will also support “payment tokens and unique product and services tokens that are similar to the Ethereum ERC-20 and ERC-721 token standards.”In practice, a zero-knowledge proof allows users to prove that they know a piece of information, be that a transaction amount or some other value, without actually revealing the underlying information. For corporations and businesses that don’t want to make sensitive financial or business information public, this privacy is considered a must if they are to use blockchain technology for their day-to-day.“With zero-knowledge proofs, organizations can transact on the same network as their competition in complete privacy and without giving up the security of the public Ethereum blockchain,” Brody concluded.The new solution will include the EY Blockchain Private Transaction Monitor, which monitors and keeps a record of transactions. The company is working on a public release of the EY Ops Chain PE and the EY Blockchain Private Transaction Monitor for 2019.Wasabi Wallet 1.0 went live today, October 31, 2018. The release, which Wasabi’s creator Ádám Ficsór humbly called “nothing revolutionary,” cleans up the software and makes it compatible with macOS.“The 1.0 release is a download and run that works properly on all platforms (Windows, Linux, OSX.) We made the wallet load time faster, caught some memory leaks, [and] rewrote the OSX backend of the UI library we used,” Ficsór told Bitcoin Magazine.A self-described “open-source, non-custodial, privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet,” Wasabi’s anonymity features center around ZeroLink, a protocol introduced by its creator, Ádám Ficsór. The protocol is a privacy framework that Ficsór architected by resurrecting a transaction cloaking method that was first proposed in 2013 but which was soon forgotten.Known as Chaumian CoinJoin, the transaction trick works just as its name would imply. Essentially, it bundles transactions together to obfuscate who is sending what to whom. To work, however, each party needs to be sending the same amount, otherwise it would be easy to discern from the difference in bitcoin sent who is sending and receiving which coins.Ficsór focused on CoinJoin and his brainchild ZeroLink came after he implemented TumbleBit into Stratis’ Breeze Wallet. The feature offers similar privacy benefits as CoinJoin, though it is more centralized and participants receive a different coin from the one they send.In our correspondence, Ficsór said Wasabi’s own CoinJoin feature “has seen over 150 BTC [transacted] with equal output amounts,” something that, combined with the team not finding “any remotely serious issues,” made Ficsór and company “pretty confident in promoting the software to be 1.0.”He also indicated that, while the updated version doesn’t tinker with the CoinJoin protocol in any way, it does include a few fundamental changes to his own invention in ZeroLink.“I designed ZeroLink in mind so that many wallets would be able to conform to ‘wallet fungibility requirements,’ however this wasn’t feasible in practice … The idea was to not let people ever join two coins together if they were already mixed … To mitigate the risks, we had to come up with a clever labeling system that led us down a road to build a coin control feature with an intra-wallet blockchain analysis tool into Wasabi. This allows the user to make educated decisions on which coins they can join together if they need to.“Later, when we saw how people use the wallet, it even got better. When designing ZeroLink I did not anticipate users to keep remixing their coins, but they do and to such an extent that it leads to an exponential anonymity increase because the re-mixes are perfect mixes, and today, 40-60 percent of all mixes are remixes. So that was quite a surprising turn of events,” he said.Ficsór stressed in our conversation that the latest release places heavy emphasis on user experience. Going forward, the team will try to iron out technical kinks even more to create a smoother, more user friendly experience — if funds and manpower allow, that is.“We are currently occupied by working on stability, performance, UX and code quality. This is our highest priority. New issues will constantly come up as new users try to use the software. At this point, it is unclear if Wasabi will ever have the resources to tackle such things.”A South Korean ICO has defrauded its private sale investors out of roughly 13,500 ETH ($2.8 million) before disappearing from the internet entirely.Pure Bit, which has already pulled the plug on its website, has apparently conducted a fairly routine exit scam for its Pure Coin token sale. The cryptocurrency was pitched as an exchange token for Pure Bit, an exchange that was supposed to launch by the end of the month. The Coin  promised to give investors shares of the exchange’s trading revenue as well as discounted fees for trading, and its anonymous team claimed that it would burn 90% of token supply over a three year period.A block explorer for the ICO’s Ethereum wallet displays several in-bound transactions from investors beginning on November 4, 2018. On November 9, 2018, however, an initial 500 ether was transferred out, with the remaining 13,178 withdrawn 20 minutes later.Not all of the evidence of this company’s very existence was destroyed immediately, however. A thread on Reddit captured some of the last moments of the exchange and took several screenshots with translations from the original Korean.According to Reddit user u/Tbid, who evidently watched the saga unfold, Pure Bit was a crypto exchange that announced an ICO launch of an exchange token. Almost immediately after the ICO ended, however, all of the funds were spirited away to another single wallet address.As depicted in the attached screenshots, the community admin quickly kicked out every participant in their Kakao chat thread, before sending a final message of “Thank You.” This information was corroborated by a Twitter thread, which added that the admin’s message on their now-defunct Kakao profile was a terse but excessively formal apology.Between the wallet transfers, suspicious website activity and the admin’s explicit apology, this exit scam is about as by-the-book as they come. Duplicitous activities such as this are a recurring threat in the world of ICO launches, which forms a large part of the reasoning why South Korea banned ICOs altogether.Having committed a crime even before stealing such vast sums of money, the anonymous administrators of Pure Bit are likely in for some extensive legal troubles. As one commenter in the Reddit thread remarked, the South Korean government is likely to be “hot on their tails.”Even without the threat of exit scams, South Korean law enforcement is well-used to dealing with routine cybersecurity threats, as the world’s largest crypto hacking syndicate, which is literally sponsored by the North Korean government, has targeted South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges on a number of occasions. International cybersecurity solutions provider Group-IB has come up with a scoring model to grade crypto exchanges based on their level of security.The scoring model was created by Group-IB in conjunction with Swiss-based Cryptolns (which is operated by Swiss insurance broker APIS AS), and the grading is intrinsic to CryptoIns’ new cryptocurrency exchange insurance, which will allow exchange users to cover up to 15 BTC worth of digital assets held in their exchange accounts. With the scoring model’s data, CryptoIns has calculated rates for their coverage depending on an exchange’s level of security and asset-protection measures.This insurance will be available for assets held on leading exchanges like Binance, OKEx, Kraken and Huobi, while a full list can be found on CryptoIns’ website.“Currently, approximately 3,600,000 BTC are stored in user accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges, making this market highly attractive for hackers,” Timofey Volkov, CEO of CryptoIns, explained.Per a recent Forbes article, crypto exchanges are attractive to hackers due to their design: They have a centralized single point of failure, making them prone to the same problems faced by millions of web applications globally. This is where the assessment from Group-IB gets interesting for the investor.The grading from Group-IB took the exchanges’ architecture and infrastructure into consideration to better understand the mechanisms used in countering potential threats.While developing the framework for its insurance policy, Cryptolns revealed that it assessed a number of exchanges using various parameters, including “the level of technical security [and] the reliability of key storage, password, and personal data of customers provided by each exchange.”Explaining the challenges faced by insurers in the crypto industry, Volkov stated that:“Collaboration with one of the leading international cybersecurity companies will help us organize and conduct pre-insurance evaluations of the exchanges in order to assess their security, as well as the potential for fraudulent activities on the part of the founders and management.”Risk GroupsThe scoring by CryptoIns also sorted exchanges into four risk groups based on aggregated information which includes \"assessment of traded volume, traders’ activity, internal fees and other characteristics.\" Exchanges categorized in the first group were graded as being the least vulnerable, second and third were \"rated satisfactory and low in security risk,\" while those in the fourth group were deemed to be overly risky, with the company saying it won't provide insurance for such exchanges.Base insurance rates are put at 2.5 percent per quarter. Each of the groups was entitled to different discounts with the maximum being a 50 percent discount, the report states.According to CryptoIns' insurance calculator on its website, U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken ranks as the safest digital asset platform with a lower cost of insuring assets. It costs users 0.0125 BTC for every 1 BTC stored on Kraken at a 1.25 percent insurance rate. The same 1 BTC will be insured on Binance and Bibox for 0.019 BTC and 0.025 BTC, respectively.Falling under the overly risky group were exchanges like Yobit which emerged as the least secure. Other less-secure exchanges, according to the list, were Zaif, Bitstamp, Bit-Z and TopBTC.Cyber threats on crypto exchanges have become a recurring event. In September 2018, Japanese digital assets platform Zaif reportedly lost $59 million due to a security breach on its system. Bithumb, CoinGrail and BitGrail all lost $30 million, $40 million and $195 million, respectively, earlier in the year.In what is becoming an emerging trend, Twitter accounts of popular brands are being hacked in an attempt to scam unsuspecting users out of their cryptocurrencies.Target and Google are two high profile targets that have seen their accounts taken over by hackers who, in turn, have used them to scam followers by advertising fraudulent crypto giveaways.Google's G Suite Twitter Account is Hacked!! Target's Twitter account, which is followed by nearly 2 million users, posted a tweet, confirming the hack which occurred on November 13, 2018. The retailer stated:\"Early this morning, our Twitter account was inappropriately accessed. The access lasted for approx. half an hour & one fake tweet was posted during that time about a bitcoin scam. We have regained control of the account, are in close contact with Twitter & are investigating now.\"Seemingly targeted by the hacking syndicate, Google's G Suite Twitter account was breached hours after Target fell victim. The hack on Google was marked by the same tactics as the one that plagued Target — a scammy tweet ridden with typos promising free bitcoin to G Suite's 800,000 followers.A Google spokesperson confirmed the hack to Business Insider in a statement:\"This morning an unauthorized promoted tweet was shared from the G Suite account. We removed the tweet and are investigating with Twitter now.\"These incidents are a more sophisticated version of the Twitter scams that have become a constant nuisance for the cryptocurrency community. Typically, these scams include bad actors merely imitating popular figures in the crypto industry with near-identical profiles, though it’s rare for the real accounts themselves to be taken over to advertise the scams.While it's unclear how scammers are gaining access to the brands' social media account, it's obvious new measures are needed to combat the scams.Criticized in the past for its failure to devise a clear defense against these incidents, Twitter is reportedly working on counter security measures to prevent similar breaches like the one witnessed by Target on its platform in the future.Earlier this year, anti-fraud software company MetaCert released Cryptonite, a browser extension that safeguards users against fraudulent accounts.A bug centering around a new Ethereum token, GasToken, which was enabling abuse on cryptocurrency exchanges, appears to have been resolved. The details are provided in a report originally published on November 13, 2018, that discussed how the bug was exploited by attackers, and what digital platforms could do if they wished to protect their hot wallet funds.It was unclear which exchanges could or could not be affected by the bug. Thus, private disclosures were issued to “as many exchanges as possible” according to a Medium post. While it was determined that most of these exchanges were not in any danger, all vulnerable exchanges have since instilled the proper protections. At press time, the bug is no longer considered a threat.According to its website, GasToken is an Ethereum-based contract that allows individuals to tokenize the Ethereum network through a special refund mechanism. Users can store gas when the price is low and garner refunds when it’s high.The website reads, “Every transaction on the network must include some gas, and the fee paid to miners for each transaction is directly proportional to the gas consumed by a transaction. GasToken allows a transaction to do the same amount of work and pay for less gas, saving on miner fees and costs and allowing users to bid higher gas prices without paying correspondingly higher fees.”The document alleges that many exchanges either enforced no gas usage limits or allowed for the withdrawal of ether to arbitrary addresses. Combined with GasToken’s refund structure, an open doorway was subsequently provided to attackers, who could then mint gas whenever they received ether and make exchanges pay for arbitrary computation.Attackers could exploit the bug in one of two ways. The first was by performing computations through Ethereum’s fallback function when a contract received Ethereum-based tokens from an exchange. If a malicious actor wanted to attack an exchange, the attacker could do so by initiating withdrawals to a contract address they controlled.Granted the person operating the exchange had failed to enforce gas limits or know-your-customer (KYC) protocols, the exchange would pay the transaction fees out of their own hot wallet. The attacker could then create several accounts to bypass any single account withdrawal limits. They could also mint GasTokens, thereby causing the exchange owner’s wallet to drain even further.The second attack vector could be exploited through a token’s transfer function. The attacker could force an exchange to pay for large amounts of computation and even cause it to burn its own ether supply.From there, the attacker could drain the exchange’s hot wallet or mint the GasTokens for a profit if they controlled the token’s code on an exchange if the token featured an upgradeable contract or if the exchange automatically lists tokens. Whenever a token transfer occurred, the attacker could work to update the function, which would perform the same computation described in the first method, and the exchange would then pay the costs of every future transfer of that token.The good news was that the bug could only affect exchanges that initiated Ethereum transactions not those that processed them. Thus, decentralized exchanges or those based on similar smart contract technology that processed transactions initiated by users were likely to remain unaffected.The report listed several options to ensure the problem didn’t persist. For example, the authors suggested implementing reasonable gas limits on all transactions. That way, if any particularly expensive transactions occurred, the users would bear all the costs, ensuring exchanges remained free and clear of any charges.In addition, exchange operators were advised to enforce both gas monitoring and rate limiting on all withdrawals. Most exchanges usually incorporate either one or the other, and neither tactic can do much on its own. Lastly, Ethereum-based contracts were told to implement gas usage restrictions when making calls to unknown addresses.In a demonstration titled “Wallet.fail,” a team of security researchers hacked into the Trezor One, Ledger Blue and Ledger Nano S. Unfortunately, it appears as if their findings were first put on display at the 35th Chaos Communication Congress (35C3) in Leipzig, Germany, rather than through accepted Responsible Disclosure practices, which would have allowed the manufacturers to patch the vulnerabilities and protect their customers from any potential attack. Fortunately, the vulnerabilities appear to be very difficult for attackers to actually exploit.The team of experts included security researchers Dmitry Nedospasov, Josh Datko and systems engineer Thomas Roth. Among the vulnerabilities revealed in the presentation were several that could have been fixed with a firmware upgrade on the hardware wallets in question.SatoshiLabs, the manufacturers of Trezor wallets, through its Chief Technology Officer Pavol Rusnak, insisted that the company had not been notified about the vulnerabilities demonstrated at the event, going on to add that there's a \"Responsible Disclosure program\" that the researchers could have followed to give them a heads-up about the loopholes.\"With regards to #35c3 findings about @Trezor: we were not informed via our Responsible Disclosure program beforehand, so we learned about them from the stage. We need to take some time to fix these, and we'll be addressing them via a firmware update at the end of January.\"Ledger took the same exception, claiming in a blog post to have been sidelined by the researchers, who could have notified them through a disclosure, which they claim would have given the firm the time needed \"for the vulnerability to be patched as well as to mitigate risks for users.\"The VulnerabilitiesAs for the vulnerabilities themselves, it appears that they cannot (yet) be exploited remotely; most of them require that the intruder have physical access to the devices in question — and sometimes access to the owner’s computer as well.At the presentation, the security experts claimed to have flashed a Trezor One hardware wallet, which allowed them to extract the mnemonic seed (and PIN) from the RAM, going on to add that the vulnerability can only be exploited against users who don't set a passphrase.The team also claimed to have installed their firmware on the Ledger Nano S, allowing them to manipulate the wallet by signing transactions remotely. To do this, the intruder would have to physically access the Nano S and hack into the victim's PC, where malware is installed to steal the PIN once the victim loads Ledger's Bitcoin app.Ledger claims that since this scenario requires an intruder to have physical access to the device, access to the victim's computer and the patience to wait for the victim to put in his PIN and launch the Bitcoin app on the PC, this type of attack is unlikely to pose much of a practical threat.The security researchers also demonstrated a proof-of-concept, side-channel attack on Ledger's most expensive hardware wallet, the Ledger Blue. According to the team, Ledger Blue leaks signals sent to its touchscreen as radio waves, making them vulnerable. This is due to the animation of the PIN keyboard. The researchers claim the signal could get stronger when a USB cable is attached to the device, allowing them to sniff the PIN of the Ledger Blue remotely.Privacy-focused bitcoin wallet Samourai is having its hand forced by Google.According to a Samourai blog post, the wallet provider is disabling privacy features that are key to its design before its latest version, 0.99.4, hits the Google Play store tomorrow. The removed features include Samourai’s Stealth Mode, remote text message (SMS) commands, and SIM Switch Defense (a measure to protect against sim swaps).The privacy restrictions only affect the version of the wallet available on Google Play. To bypass these restrictions, users can also download what Samourai calls the “non-nerfed version” of the wallet client’s latest version directly from the project’s Github. Down the road, the team also hopes to get the wallet, privacy features fully-enabled, listed on F-Droid and other alternative, open-source app stores, as well.“In October, Google announced changes to their policies regarding SMS and Dialer permissions that apps are allowed to use. The way that our Stealth Mode, Remote SMS commands, and SIM Switch Defense work require use of these permissions,” a Samourai Wallet representative told Bitcoin Magazine in an email correspondence.Samourai proceeded to file for an exemption, but they were notified of their exemption’s rejection just “a few days ago,” according to the representative.“Unfortunately, they didn't tell us anything specifically, we learned of everything through automated emails that could not be responded to,” they continued.Samourai is only available for Android, in part because it can’t pin down iOS developers who “are willing to work for the passion of it over the profit,” the representative indicated. The project hasn’t “had much luck with iOS developers so far,” but it is “committed to bringing some version of Samourai to the iOS store eventually,” they claimed.With these restrictions, Samourai lamented the changing landscape of Android over the past few versions. These changes have, in Samourai’s words, created a “walled garden,” something the wallet provider discusses in its blog post and reiterated in our correspondence.“Very strict changes in background data a few versions ago meant that Samourai users would no longer receive alerts on incoming payments unless we routed all alerts through Google’s own servers. We obviously decided not to do that, but that was — in our view — the beginnings of the walled garden being built. The latest policy changes regarding SMS and Dialer permissions show a marked change of strategy for Google, bringing it closer in alignment with the Apple iOS Store than ever before.”If users opt to download the wallet directly from Samourai’s Github, the team cautioned that they should “verify the integrity of the APK they download by comparing the SHA-256 hash of their APK with the SHA-256 hash published on Github.”At time of publication, Google had not responded to Bitcoin Magazine’s request for comment.On January 26, 2019, clients of peer-to-peer bitcoin trading service LocalBitcoins were the targets of a phishing scam which resulted in the theft of a handful of bitcoins.The Scam’s OperationReports claimed that the attacker was able to conduct the scam thanks to a security vulnerability on the LocalBitcoins platform. The landing page of the site’s forum reportedly was hacked, leading clients to a phishing site.The phishing site was designed to carefully mimic the features of the actual LocalBitcoins landing page. Once on it, users were prompted to log in and provide their sensitive, two-factor authentication codes.As soon as the hackers gained access to the codes, the users had the bitcoins in their wallet stolen.“We would like to inform that today 26.01.2019 at approximately 10:00:00 UTC, LocalBitcoins has detected a security vulnerability – an unauthorized source was able to access and send transactions from a number of affected accounts. Outgoing transactions were temporarily disabled while we investigated the case,” LocalBitcoins noted in a Reddit post.A user who claimed to have been hacked was able to identify the address of the hacker, and it was later found that the address has received a total of 7.95205862 BTC from five, separate transactions (equivalent to about $28,134 at press time).LocalBitcoins Safe Again?According to an announcement made by LocalBitcoins on Reddit, the exchange claims that the vulnerability to their system surfaced from flaws in a third-party software the exchange uses for its forum. In addition to that, LocalBitcoins stated that its security team was able to find and extinguish the issue quickly.It confirmed that the vulnerability allowed the attacker to gain access to an undisclosed number of accounts, although at press time, it only knew of six cases where users had been affected.It was reported that the exchange mitigated the vulnerability by blocking user access to their wallets until the issue was resolved. Also, the exchange suspended trading activities for a short period while its developers worked on neutralizing the threat. The platform was returned to full functionality a few hours after the hack.The team noted that the vulnerability was fixed. However, there was no mention of whether or not affected users will be compensated for their losses and how they intend to track the stolen bitcoins.The post also noted that the platform’s forum feature would remain disabled for security reasons, so for now, buyers and sellers will only be able to interact through the platform’s ciphered P2P chat.On February 4, 2019, blockchain tech company Blockstream announced the development of a “proof of reserves” tool to standardize the authenticity of exchanges’ crypto reserves. The Bitcoin development company has submitted a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) to the bitcoin-dev mailing list for consideration.Blockstream stated that it is “open-sourcing the development of the tool for feedback from the industry.” Citing high-profile hacks as a reason why such services would be in demand, Blockstream is hoping to create a “best-practice standard Proof of Reserves for the industry, that offers broad compatibility with the way most Bitcoin exchanges are storing their users’ funds.”Blockstream stated that it the original idea for the tool was to build a means for its Liquid functionaries to prove their Liquid bitcoin (L-BTC) reserves to third-party auditors. But it soon recognized that there were further applications that could reach beyond Liquid and be useful to cryptocurrency exchanges in general.“Put in as simple terms as possible, Proof of Reserves allows an exchange to prove how many bitcoin they could spend, without needing to generate a ‘live’ transaction or exposing themselves to the risks of moving funds.”Reducing Security RisksAs the technology is envisioned currently, the tool will be able to circumvent some of the typical problems associated with proving cash reserves, namely the security risks associated with current verification methods that exchanges typically employ. With the help of the tool, an exchange “first constructs a single transaction which spends all of an exchange’s [unspent bitcoin].”Basically, this function aggregates all of the cryptocurrencies sitting in the exchanges wallets into a transaction, but instead of sending this transaction — and creating a potential attack vector — the tool deliberately “sabotages” it. The transaction still shows that the wallets in question have all of the assets, but none of the assets get moved around. In this way, none of the exchange’s actual assets are at risk of being spent or attacked, and the amount of currency is still verified.“This transaction data can then be shared with anyone that needs to verify reserves. They simply import the data into their own Proof of Reserves client to confirm the exchange’s total holdings and the addresses associated with those holdings.”Removing the Need for TrustThe other problem that the Proof of Reserves tool is intended to alleviate is the technical barrier that prevents users from checking on the reserves of an exchange they may want to transact on. In other words, it’s difficult for non-technical users to verify the reserves for themselves, forcing them to trust that the exchange is operating in good faith.And there have been plenty of questions surrounding the veracity of reserve claims in the crypto space which could make customers uneasy about placing their trust in an exchange. On February 5, 2019, for example, a Canadian court granted cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX bankruptcy protection and appointed Ernst & Young as monitors to help the exchange locate any funds it could use to reimburse its customers.Following the death of QuadrigaCX’s co-founder and CEO Gerald Cotten, the exchange claims to have lost access to some $190 million in deposited funds, alleging that Cotten was the only one able to access his encrypted laptop where the keys and passwords are stored. This has caused many users to question whether or not the exchange actually has the stated funds in reserve.Third-party verification of actual cash reserves could help potential users identify whether or not an exchange is operating in good faith and under acceptable standard practices.Privacy ConcernsThus far, however, Blockstream’s verification tool has at least one area of significant concern: it reveals the entire transaction history of the participating exchanges. If this problem were to persist, the tool could be used to unmask all of users’ transactions with the exchange in question. Although this glitch would obviously be completely impractical for confidentiality reasons, the underlying premise of the tool does work, and the blog post states that Blockstream hopes to create a fully confidential version with the help of the new open-source development process.U.S.-based digital asset platform Coinbase has acquired blockchain intelligence startup Neutrino. The company made the news known earlier today, February 19, 2019, but the cost of the acquisition was not disclosed.The announcement reads:\"Neutrino’s technology is the best we’ve encountered in this space, and it will play an important role in legitimizing crypto, making it safer and more accessible for people all over the world.\"The blockchain startup will analyze data on public blockchains and help prevent theft of funds on Coinbase, investigate ransomware attacks when they come up and identify the culprits using its suite of tools.Neutrino offers similar services to New York-based Chainalysis, designing and developing tools for monitoring data on the blockchain. Per its website, Neutrino creates custom solutions for \"monitoring, analyzing and tracking cryptocurrency flows across multiple blockchains, providing actionable insight on the whole cryptocurrency ecosystem.\"With its analytical capabilities, Neutrino will help Coinbase add new features and tokens to the platform, while ensuring \"compliance with local laws and regulations.\"Beyond analytics, Neutrino claims to have some firepower under its sleeves. The startup has a solution specifically developed for law enforcement agencies dubbed the XFlow nSpect, which allows for total tracking of cryptocurrency movements across multiple blockchains. Per details on its website, Neutrino claims the XFlow can be used to track stolen funds, monitoring their flow from one exchange to another, mixers and other services in real time.Coinbase says Neutrino will not go through any rebranding efforts. Instead it will continue to operate as an independent entity out of Coinbase's London office. The exchange sees the acquisition as a step in the right direction for creating an \"open financial system.\"According to an official statement published on February 25, 2019, Bitfinex has revealed that the United States government returned 27.7 BTC (worth about $105,000 USD) to the exchange, as part of restitution for a hack that was effected on the exchange back in 2016.The returned tokens represent just 0.023 percent of the bitcoin stolen in the infamous 2016 hack.Bitfinex said that U.S. federal law enforcement informed them in November of last year that it had obtained access to the stolen funds.Bitfinex CFO Giancarlo Devasini was full of praise for the efforts of law enforcement officers in the recovery, stating:Over two years following the hack of the Bitfinex platform, today we see the results of a clear and robust response strategy and the efforts of the U.S. government. It gives us great pleasure to be able to reimburse our traders that were loyal to us and believed in us at a very difficult time.Devasini also reiterated the exchange’s willingness to help investigators in their inquiries, calling on individuals with useful information about the hack to reach out so they can “finally resolve the situation in a mutually beneficial manner.”The Hack and Bitfinex’s Retrieval EffortsTwo years ago, the crypto community woke up to the news of 119,756 BTC stolen from the wallets of Bitfinex in one of the largest crypto exchange hacks since Mt. Gox was breached in 2014.The exchange had generalized the losses across all accounts, crediting BFX tokens for every dollar lost in the hack. Tokens were redeemed for a dollar or exchanged for the company’s stocks — those who chose to hold shares had their BFX tokens converted into Recovery Right Tokens (RRT).Per the announcement, the recovered tokens are currently being converted to USD and will be paid to holders of RRT.“The benefit to RRT holders is that in the event of any retrieval of the stolen property, and after any outstanding or unconverted BFX token holders have been reimbursed, recovered funds are distributed to RRT holders, up to 1 dollar per RRT,” the statement reads.The New Zealand-based crypto asset exchange Cryptopia has made their assessment of a January hack, claiming that up to 9.4 percent of all their assets were stolen.In January 2019, the exchange went offline after publicly reporting a “major security breach,” which likely resulted in a theft of at least $3 million USD. Promising to involve several of the nation’s law enforcement agencies, Cryptopia’s announcement also stated that all of the exchange’s functionality and trading services would be suspended until further notice.The exchange, as well as Cryptopia’s website, are still down in late February. Users have been left largely in the dark as to any updates on the site’s functionality or Cryptopia’s plans to deal with the fallout of this hack.On February 26, 2019, the exchange’s Twitter account began posting several updates to the situation. First, they claimed to have calculated a worst-case scenario for January’s hack: up to 9.4 percent of all holdings in the exchange. Later that same day, tweets on the account suggested that the exchange is making preparations to reopen trading by securing individual accounts, though a later tweet instructs users to not deposit any further funds into their old wallet addresses. Cryptopia’s Twitter account is promising future updates to come regarding the site’s reopening.According to a Chainalysis report issued at the beginning of February 2019, it is likely that this hack and several others were perpetrated by two groups, dubbed “Alpha” and “Beta.” These hackers displayed a sophisticated method of funneling stolen crypto assets into a variety of wallets and exchanging said assets into fiat without leaving a trail that investigators could follow.When Coinbase acquired Neutrino for an unspecified amount in February 2019, the news looked like business as usual: A cryptocurrency juggernaut had made another acquisition. But the company in question, specifically the ties it has to the unethical practices of one of its predecessors, suggests that the monolithic Coinbase may be joining the oligarchic ranks of its privacy-hostile, too-big-for-consumer-comfort counterparts in legacy tech.The Ties That DamnOn its website, Italian blockchain analysis company Neutrino proudly advertises that its proprietary software offers all-in-one “solutions for law enforcement” and “financial services.” Its two flagships, XFlow nSpect and XFlow nSight, are billed as “comprehensive solution[s] for monitoring[,] analyzing and tracking cryptocurrency flows across multiple blockchains.” nSight was built to help exchanges and financial service companies like Coinbase to stay regulatorily compliant. nSpect, on the other hand, was built for “criminal investigations and intelligence gathering” and is specifically marketed toward law enforcement.Continuing on with their work at Coinbase, the Neutrino team, a three-man show consisting of CEO Giancarlo Russo, CRO Marco Valleri and CTO Alberto Ornaghi, are no strangers to building complex computer monitoring software for law agencies.In another life, they did it as Hacking Team, the notorious Italian software services firm whose dubious business practices made them an antagonist of the wider tech and privacy community. Hacking Team got their start when Valleri and Ornaghi (under the aliases NaGa and ALoR) sold man-in-the-middle attack software to the police force of Milan, Italy, in 2003. These two founders would later be joined by Russo, who acted as COO of the company.Throughout its history, Hacking Team sold its services to oppressive regimes in Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Sudan, Kazakhstan, Bahrain and Turkey, among others. These services centered around Hacking Team’s proprietary Remote Control System (RCS) software, a Trojan horse malware that gives users the ability to remotely access files, record keystrokes, take photos and read emails from any infected device.Email leaks reported by The Intercept trace the team’s cyber footprints to human rights abuses around the world. Hacking Team’s RCS technology was used by the Ethiopian government (which ranks as one of the most oppressive in Africa, with a penchant for silencing free speech) to surveil and interfere with the operations of Ethiopian Satellite Television and Radio, a news outlet run by Ethiopian expats. The technology helped the Turkish government to spy on an American, and it was also sold to the Sudanese National Intelligence and Security Service in 2012 for a whopping €960,000 (around $1,210,000 at the time), though the team shuttered Sudan’s access to their software in 2014 when the government’s clumsy implementation of the software showed that they weren’t “enough prepared for the product usage,” Hacking Team emails reveal. It also played its part in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia and the assault and arrest of UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor.Reporters Without Borders labeled Hacking Team as one of five “Enemies of the Internet” in 2013 for its role in humanitarian abuses against journalists.During the 2012 uprisings in Morocco that were inspired by the Arab Spring movement, RCS, under the control of the Moroccan government, singled out Mamfakinch.com, an outlet that published journalists who were vocal critics of the regime. The leaked emails prove that Hacking Team had been selling its software to Morocco since 2010. This would culminate in Mamfakinch’s hardware being infected by a Trojan horse virus, which originally masqueraded as a news tip.“Mamfakinch.com came as the first citizen media portal to document protests, providing tools like mapping of protests and also articles. At the time it started, I was not a member. I was asked to join later by one of the co-founders,” Zineb, a pro-democracy activist who was involved with Mamfakinch, told Bitcoin Magazine.The outlet employed the help of the Citizen Lab to dismantle the virus and trace it back to its Hacking Team source, though most of the damage had already been done by the time they consulted this help.“Moroccan activists suffer tremendously from what government surveillance provides them with, and former ones like myself have seen what that can be like. From physical threats to family threats, and even worse threats to fellow activists who were part of the human rights and digital rights effort in Morocco,” she said.Hacking Team repeatedly refused to disclose its clients, and the internal emails betray that, more often than not, when their ties to human rights abuses and oppressive regimes were unearthed by international media, they always tried to mitigate the scrutiny and severity of the ensuing bad press.In June of 2014, a U.N. panel inquired into Hacking Team’s business with Sudan for violating sanctions regarding weapons exports to the country. The U.N. considered Hacking Team’s software a weapon of sorts, something that Russo refutes in internal emails while also emphasizing that the team wants to keep its name clear from any records regarding the investigation.“It looks like their focus is to trace every single armament,” wrote Russo. “We absolutely need to avoid being mentioned in these documents.”Why Coinbase (and We) Should CareThe U.N. investigative panel would mark the beginning of Hacking Team’s unraveling. By March 2016, the Italian government revoked Hacking Team’s export license after an Italian PhD student was murdered in Cairo, Egypt. Hacking Team’s software was allegedly involved in the crime. With the company’s revenue streams severely restricted, Hacking Team was on its last financial leg.Conveniently, Neutrino was founded the same year that Italian officials revoked Hacking Team’s export license, “very obviously around the time that they would have been desperate for money and needing to start fresh somehow,” Janine, a member of crypto podcast Block Digest who initially raised the alarm about Hacking Team and Neutrino’s ties, told Bitcoin Magazine.Bitcoin Magazine spoke to Janine to learn more about the possible ramifications of this acquisition. In addition to her work at Block Digest, Janine has been a consistent and reliable whistleblower for industry developments that could indicate privacy threats. In the past, she also helped dissect community concerns surrounding the privacy implications of Bitfury’s Peach Lightning suite.As with the Bitfury situation, Janine has covered every angle of Neutrino and Hacking Team’s shared past on Twitter, and she helped Block Digest produce a two-hour segment on the subject, as well. Since Neutrino was acquired by Coinbase, the team is more than financially secure. Furthermore, as part of the deal, it will continue to act autonomously out of Coinbase’s London office. The exchange framed the buyout as a means to outfit itself with the proper tools to remain KYC- and AML-compliant with regulators. Janine points out that the company will likely make use of XFlow nSight to this end, though she’s also worried that Neutrino’s technology will come with more serious privacy trade-offs than nSight’s base functionality.“The chain analysis stuff is not really that interesting to me; it is how much access Coinbase will give to Neutrino,” she told Bitcoin Magazine.More specifically, she expressed concern about Money Module, a Hacking Team software that allows the user to access devices and private keys. Janine is also suspicious of the backdoors that Hacking Team coded into their software: “They likely had access to whatever data these government clients were collecting from their targets.”If Coinbase forks over too much data to Neutrino for transaction analysis, and if a backdoor to the software exists in tandem with Money Module, this could spell disaster for user privacy and private key security.That this backdoor may exist alongside a vehicle for stealing user funds is disturbing — even more disturbing, Janine and other critics have suggested, is Coinbase’s ability to overlook the history of unethical business practices of Neutrino’s team.When Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Coinbase to ask about the acquisition and how it plans to use Neutrino, the exchange sent back a general statement, indicating that they are aware of and don’t condone Hacking Team’s practices. But this past behavior is not enough for Coinbase to distance themselves from a team whose expertise is in line with its vision. Zineb, who is also a crypto enthusiast, told us that it’s disheartening to see the same privacy-compromising and autocratic software eke its way into the cryptocurrency space. You expect this from the legacy tech industry, she expressed, but you don’t expect it in an industry whose tenets rest on privacy, freedom and censorship resistance.“To have Coinbase acquire anything run by anyone ever associated with Hacking Team is alarming,” she said. “Perhaps Coinbase is clueless as to WHY it’s important to protect [these virtues], but I’m not. When banks freeze or easily hand over private financial information of dissidents in autocratic countries, that’s when a system like [Bitcoin] is needed.“They say this is to protect user data. But how can they possibly trust that those who engaged in such appalling actions would somehow have Coinbase user data privacy’s best interest at heart? I can’t say much for others but I can only speak for myself: I won’t be using any of their tools in the future, and shame on them for allowing the Hacking Team people to continue to thrive.\"Coinbase’s Director of Institutional Sales, Christine Sandler, said in an interview last week that, in part, the exchange acquired controversial software firm Neutrino because its prior blockchain analysis providers were selling customer data.“The compelling reason for making the acquisition was that Neutrino had some industry leading, best in class technology. It was important for us to migrate away from our current providers. They were selling client data to outside sources and it was compelling for us to get control over that and have proprietary technology that we could leverage to keep the data safe and protect our clients,” Sandler said in an interview with Cheddar.In its current privacy policy, Coinbase asserts that it only shares customer information with third parties for fraud prevention and legal compliance as well as for “bill collection, marketing, and other technology services.” The same active policy says that they will personally never sell client information, transaction or personal, and nor will these third parties.Sandler’s slip up tells another tale. If her statement is true, then Coinbase may have inadvertently violated its terms of use. Coinbase users believed that their data was only being shared for regulatory purpose, not being monetized, as Jill Carlson points out on Twitter:“Selling data is very different from collecting it for regulatory purposes. I consented to Coinbase collecting my data for KYC/AML purposes. I did not knowingly consent to Coinbase collecting my data to sell to other parties.”Seeing as their prior providers breached this trust, Coinbase’s acquisition of Neutrino makes sense; out with the old and in with the (hopefully more trustworthy) new. In one of its news blurbs, cryptocurrency media platform Messari indicates that the purchase was likely made to minimize counterpart risk by bringing analysis services in house. Most all other exchanges use the same providers, a source told Messari, so going with the new kid on the block was likely the only way Coinbase could make sure the provider would do as they’re told.“A source with knowledge of the situation explained there wasn't much of a choice for Coinbase, as almost all regulated crypto exchanges likely use one of several large blockchain analytics tools, including those from industry leaders Elliptic and Chainalysis. The source said that those firms had moved to a ‘give-get’ data model, where Coinbase would only have been permitted to use the service in return for providing its own data. Coinbase ‘brought that capability in house so they weren’t in a situation where using a 3rd party tool was making it better’ as a surveillance tech.”Still, if Coinbase was looking for a team it could trust, Neutrino’s past is far from trustworthy. The company’s three executives used to run a business called Hacking Team, which sold surveillance malware to authoritarian regimes around the world which precipitated, among other human rights abuses, the monitoring, imprisonment and death of journalists and regime dissidents.Neutrino’s past has it and Coinbase embroiled in intense community scrutiny, and the collective ire has manifested in a #DeleteCoinbase campaign on Twitter.Coinbase claims that Neutrino offer best-in-class software, hence why they’re the best fit for AML/KYC compliance and other business-related transaction analysis. But even disregarding the questions of trust that Neutrino’s past may muster, the company’s pedigree might not even be all that up-to-snuff.Jesse Powell, CEO of Kraken exchange, said that Neutrino was disqualified “due [to its] risks” in a compliance evaluation. Even without this risk, they came in last for actual product when compared to four other providers.“I asked our Compliance team what they thought of Neutrino,” Powell tweeted. “Fortunately, they'd just completed an evaluation. Neutrino came in last place on product (out of the 5) but was disqualified anyway due to the risks. However, other factors are important in M&A: cost, culture fit.”BHB Network head Giacomo Zucco told Bitcoin Magazine that his company gave a negative evaluation of Neutrino’s services for similar reasons that Kraken’s compliance review raised red flags. Zucco told Bitcoin Magazine that, when BHB Network evaluated a live demo of Neutrino’s blockchain analysis technology for a client in February 2017, the company refused to let BHB test the tech using their own addresses.The demo was conducted using “pre-defined addresses,” he said, and the team argued that they couldn’t open source the software because the technology had its own “secret” algorithm that they couldn’t give away.“We didn't actually get so far. After the demo, I had some doubts about the ‘secret source’ claims. Then we googled names and that was enough for me to tell my client to pass,” Zucco told Bitcoin Magazine.At the time of publication, Coinbase had not returned Bitcoin Magazine’s request for comment.After a week of community discontent, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has decided to sever its business relationship with Neutrino employees who previously worked at the notorious Italian malware/software provider Hacking Team.Blaming “a gap in [Coinbase’s] diligence process,” CEO Brian Armstrong writes in a Medium post that Coinbase “did not properly evaluate everything from the perspective of our mission and values as a crypto company.”Last week, Neutrino’s link to Hacking Team came to light thanks to Twitter commentators like Block Digest’s “Janine.” At least three individuals in Neutrino’s core team (CEO Giancarlo Russo, CRO Marco Valleri and CTO Alberto Ornaghi) had been principal employees of Hacking Team, as well as Luca Guerre, an intern-turned-software-engineer at the company.Coinbase did not disclose which team members would be let go, so there’s no information to indicate how many other Neutrino employees might be affected by the severance. Armstrong also offered no timeline in his post for when these departures would take place.Disbanded in 2016, Hacking Team made headlines during its business’ zenith for selling surveillance malware to authoritarian governments. Their software’s use has been implicated in inumerable privacy and human rights abuses, including the death and imprisonment of journalists and civil rights activists.News of Hacking Team’s abuses spread like wildfire through the community, in part stoked by tenacious media coverage and social media backlash, culminating in a #DeleteCoinbase campaign.And apparently, this heat was enough for Coinbase to decide to dissolve its connections with the people previously associated with Hacking Team.Previously, the exchange had defended its acquisition in a blanket statement sent to the press. Coinbase stated that it “does not condone nor will it defend the actions of Hacking Team,” but that it was “important for [it] to bring [blockchain analysis services] in-house to fully control and protect our customers' data, and Neutrino’s technology was the best we encountered in the space to achieve this goal.”A few days after this response to the situation, Coinbase’s Director of Institutional Sales, Christine Sandler, would tell Cheddar that the need to bring these services in-house to protect data was due to its former blockchain analysis providers monetizing user data, something that is against Coinbase’s privacy policy.In his post, Armstrong mentions that Neutrino was also acquired because their old providers didn’t support all the assets [the exchange] wanted to have on [its] platform,” so it “examined the players, found that Neutrino had some of the best technology in this area, and decided to acquire them.”Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase purchased controversial Italian software services provider Neutrino for $13.5 million (€12 million), a copy of a legal document dated February 15, 2019, and shared with Bitcoin Magazine reveals. The hard numbers of the acquisition were previously unknown.The document leak comes after a week of turbulent developments following the February 19 acquisition. Community members, namely Block Digest podcast member Janine, began to raise ethical concerns stemming from the company’s shared past with Hacking Team, an Italian, man-in-the-middle software provider whose malware and spyware has been linked to human rights and privacy abuses around the globe.This revelation invoked strong reactions among some community members, eventually manifesting in the #DeleteCoinbase movement. Coinbase ultimately buckled under the mounting pressure, announcing that it would be parting ways with Neutrino staff with ties to Hacking Team. Per the deal, Neutrino would “continue to operate as a standalone business based out of [Coinbase’s] London office,” meaning CRO Marco Valleri, CTO Alberto Ornaghi and CEO Giancarlo Russo were originally slated to stay on as executives until the severance.Marco Valleri and Alberto Ornaghi were both founders of Hacking Team, and Neutrino’s CEO, Giancarlo Russo, joined Hacking Team in 2004 as COO. At their new company, each executive held 22 percent of its shares — in capital allocation, $5,650 each (€5,000). The other 33 percent of shares, valued at $8,500 (€7,500), was held by 360 Capital, a French-Italian venture capital firm registered in Paris which invested $565,000 (€500,000) in the project in April 2017.The document says that Coinbase agreed to purchase “the units of the respective total ownership representing the entire share capital of the Company.” Proportional to their shares in Neutrino, from the acquisition, Ornaghi, Russo and Valleri will each receive $2,951,792.91 (€2,608,916.11), while 360 Capital will receive $4,993,401.86 (€4,413,374.16). On the day the contract was signed, the acquisition’s notary paid each executive $487,045 (€430,471) and 360 Capital $4,055,107 (€3,584,071). The remaining $8,332,534 (€7,364,637) was transferred to a Credit Suisse trust account associated with the company, though it’s unclear how or when the remaining capital will be disbursed to the former shareholders.The Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange DragonEx has announced a security breach to its users via its official Telegram channel. In the message, a company administrator revealed that the hackers stole assets belonging to both the exchange and its users.Per the message from the admin, the attack occurred on March 24, 2019, and the exchange then decided to take its servers offline under the pretense of “system maintenance/upgrade.” A day after, users were notified on Telegram that the exchange had been hacked.“Part of the assets were retrieved back, and we will do our best to retrieve back the rest of stolen assets,” the message read. “Several Judicial administrations were informed about this cybercrime case including Estonia, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, etc., and we’re assisting policemen to do investigation. All platform services will be closed and the accurate assets loss recovery situation will be announced in a week.”Earlier today, the company shared the wallet addresses suspected to contain the stolen funds.The total amount of funds stolen is still unknown. However, an analysis of the Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) wallet addresses provided by the company shows balances of 1,522 ETH (worth about $202,730 USD) and 135 BTC (worth about $528,855 USD), respectively.The full list of suspected wallet addresses provided by DragonEx includes those of popular exchanges including Bittrex, Huobi and Binance.DragonEx has asked for assistance from other trading platforms and wallet providers within the industry as it works to recover from the hack.“We earnestly request help from all our fellow exchanges and other industry strength, please help us to investigate and traced the assets, freeze them and stop the assets flows,” per the Telegram message listing the suspected wallet addresses.At press time, DragonEx is the 32nd largest exchange in the world by 24-hour trade volumes, trading over $180 million in the last 24 hours.Samourai Wallet announced this month that its latest update supports Tor integration, offering additional privacy for users.What Does Tor Integration Enable?In a conversation with Bitcoin Magazine, Samourai’s lead developer, who is known simply as “TD,” gave a rundown of the Tor integration. He explained that using the Tor integration before creating a new wallet can shield a user’s identity beyond the fact that they are not required to provide any personal information. With Tor, Samourai’s servers will not be able to see a user’s IP address when they connect to the API, only their Bitcoin addresses, thus protecting the one piece of information that could tie their wallet to their real-world identity.He also noted that Tor-enabled connectivity paves the way for Samourai’s forthcoming Whirlpool mixing services and full-node Dojo offering, two more privacy-enhancing features.“Our users have been requesting tighter Tor integration for some time,” TD explained. “It was a prerequisite for rolling out Whirlpool and Dojo.”Whirlpool is Samourai’s implementation of ZeroLink, a coin-mixing protocol that has been anticipated since 2017. ZeroLink’s protocol demands the use of Tor, enabling Whirlpool to break chain analysis between incoming and outgoing coins. This shuffling helps to ensure privacy and further secure anonymity of the origin source of an outgoing transaction.Samourai’s wallet-specific full node, Dojo, has been tailor-made to run over a Tor-only connection. This further establishes privacy, as the personal Dojo will include backend APIs that allow the Samourai Wallet to connect to the Dojo directly, bypassing the company’s own servers. The intent is to provide greater security and verification measures for users. The Samourai website claims that the full-node Dojo will sport an easy-to-use interface.Samourai has also planned for a directory of PayNyms, a feature that provides users with stealth addresses to send transactions anonymously between other Samourai Wallet users.Tor Has Its IssuesTD acknowledged that Tor integration could make for a slower network than others under certain conditions, though he suggested that “Tor users [would] readily accept that tradeoff.”Other concerns relating to the Tor network might include the fact that it is blocked in certain locations and/or by certain internet service providers.Regardless of its limitations, the privacy potential makes Tor essential to Samourai Wallet’s near future.“Connectivity over Tor is now an integral part of Samourai Wallet and will be maintained in an important position within our code base as we move forward,” TD said.After a year on its testnet, the VeriBlock blockchain went live yesterday on the Bitcoin mainnet, allowing exchanges, wallet providers, merchants and other crypto businesses to leverage Bitcoin’s robust blockchain security.Now that it’s live on the mainnet, VeriBlock’s model extends the Bitcoin blockchain’s security protection from 51-percent attacks to non-Bitcoin blockchains by linking them to the Bitcoin blockchain, offering it as a security backstop.How Does VeriBlock Work?VeriBlock allows any blockchain to inherit the full proof-of-work security of Bitcoin using a novel consensus protocol — proof of proof — which records snapshots of any given blockchain and embeds them (in an aggregated form) in Bitcoin transactions, allowing the former to inherit the latter’s security characteristics.These snapshots can be automatically referenced by the protocol in the event of a 51-percent attack to determine the correct chain. The presence of conflicting snapshots for a particular “altchain” triggers early attack detection (EAD) metrics, which warns users about the potential rewrite before they confirm the transaction and updates them when the transaction is safe to accept.VeriBlock uses OP_RETURN — a type of bitcoin transaction that is used for embedding data on the blockchain. It can be used for anything from proving the existence of some data at a specific point in time (proof of existence) to issuing new assets, all on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.“A ‘regular’ Bitcoin transaction and one carrying a VeriBlock publication need not be mutually exclusive,” VeriBlock CTO Max Sanchez said. “It would be a relatively simple engineering matter to add an option in a Bitcoin wallet that said ‘Sending BTC? Secure the crypto-ecosystem with VeriBlock and subsidize your BTC transaction fee.’”Does VeriBlock Create Problems for Bitcoin?There have been estimates of the percentage of the Bitcoin blockspace used by VeriBlock that range from 20 percent of the network to as high as 45 percent. This may raise some concerns about how VeriBlock will affect the network.“This was widely reported right before the VeriBlock testnet was phased out,” Sanchez said. “However, the effects of proof of proof on the Bitcoin network are actually very small … As demand for bitcoin transactions increases and users are willing to bid higher fees, the amount of space VeriBlock consumes in Bitcoin will shrink — the two economic forces result in an equilibrium.”Sanchez also noted that VeriBlock’s solution offers security regardless of Bitcoin’s transaction frequency at a given time.“The natural ebb-and-flow of VeriBlock transaction volume on Bitcoin does not affect the security characteristics of VeriBlock or VeriBlock-secured altchains, nor does it adversely affect Bitcoin,” he said.Jameson Lopp, CTO of Casa, has been observing VeriBlock’s activity on Bitcoin’s testnet for over a year.During an episode of the HSHR8 podcast on March 20, 2019, Lopp said that he doesn’t see the VeriBlock venture as an attack on the Bitcoin network, as some might, but he wondered about the economics of spending millions in fees to provide security.“If you’re paying the fees to put it in the blockchain and you convince some miners to put it in, then there might be some economic rationality for this,” he said. Lopp also noted that he can see “the value of having a data anchor” for Bitcoin.“We believe that VeriBlock elegantly expands Bitcoin’s usefulness and does so in a way that doesn’t result in a burden on the network,” VeriBlock CEO Justin Fisher told Bitcoin Magazine. “It drives demand for Bitcoin and also, in its own way, helps make Bitcoin more secure while maximizing the utility derived from Bitcoin’s energy consumption.”In an announcement on March 25, 2019, Matt Roszak, Bloq co-founder; Anthony Di Iorio, founder and CEO of Decentral; and Bill Shihara, co-founder and CEO of Bittrex, all commended VeriBlock on its innovative new protocol, expecting it to add a new level of security to the blockchain ecosystem.\"Bloq is proud to have been part of the journey with VeriBlock over the past two years — and especially with a technology that helps any blockchain project thrive and benefit from the security that Bitcoin provides,” Roszak wrote on his company blog. “As the multi-chain, multi-network, multi-token world emerges, we are confident that VeriBlock will continue to play a vital role as a security root for this new frontier.\"The vice president of crypto exchange BitBuy, Jordan Anderson, also praised the solution in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine.“VeriBlock is an excellent example of a proof-of-proof initiative to ensure altcoins are not susceptible to a 51-percent attack,” he said. “VeriBlock will promote security and stability within the altcoin ecosystem, and provide greater confidence to consumers looking to participate.”Meanwhile, long-time bitcoin core developer Peter Todd was more apprehensive, explaining that he needed time to look at the actual implementation of the VeriBlock project.“The general idea of piggybacking on an existing consensus system is a good one,” he said. “But VeriBlock is an unusually complex variant of that idea, so I'm not confident given what I've seen in the white paper that it is secure.”The Chinese security service provider 360 Security has issued a warning that a large number of crypto exchanges have been targeted by the North Korean hacker group Lazarus and that the number is still rising after the recent hacks of crypto exchanges DragonEx, Etbox and BiKi.360 Core Security found that Lazarus, also known as the ATP-C-26 group, used software called “Worldbit-bot” to carry out its active attacks. The crypto exchange DragonEx fell victim to it on March 24, 2019, leading to a loss of $7.09 million, according to the 360 Security report.The analysis by the 360 Advanced Threat Response Team detailed that the attacking group registered two domains, wb-invest.net and wb-bot.org, last October in preparation for the attacks. Then they faked the cryptocurrency trading software Worldbit-bot based on the open-sourced “Qt Bitcoin Trader,” which was embedded with malicious code. The malicious software was then camouflaged within a regular automated crypto trading platform under the domains of wb-invest.net and wb-bot.org, which kept normal operation for half a year. The attackers targeted a large number of internal staff at cryptocurrency exchanges for the software promotion. The latest phishing attacks took place in January and March 2019.According to China-based JohnWick Security, which has been assisting DragonEx in investigating its hacking incident, the customer service staff at DragonEx appear to have opened an installation package named wbbot.dmg from an unknown source. Analysis indicates a backdoor was embedded in the installation package, through which hackers acquired the internal staff’s authorization and then obtained the wallet private key.The “Worldbit-bot” software operates in much the same manner, with the faked crypto trading software “Celas Trade Pro,” and was detected by the same team at 360 Security last August. Users of Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Bitmarket, BTCChina, GOC.io, Indacoin, OKCoin, WEX and Y0bit were susceptible to the threat at that time.First, the process information is collected and encrypted.System information is collected, Malicious codes are executed and decrypted for file execution. The security company is recommending that crypto exchanges be on the lookout for warning signs such as abnormal exchange earnings, tampered addresses of cold and hot wallets, large sum transfers and multiple account logins for coin withdrawal.Lazarus is an infamous hacking group backed by North Korea. According to research, the group’s earliest attack may have been associated with “Operation Flame,” a large-scale DDOS attack on the South Korean government website in 2007. Lazarus is also alleged to have been the group behind the Sony Pictures hacking incident of 2014, the Bank of Bangladesh data breach of 2016 and the “Wannacry” ransomware attack that swept across the globe in 2017. Since 2017, the group has been expanding its targets of attack, increasingly aiming them at a variety of economic interests. In earlier attacks, the group mainly targeted the banking systems of traditional financial institutions. Now, it has begun to attack global cryptocurrency businesses and individuals.As previously reported, Lazarus is purportedly responsible for $571 million of the $882 million in cryptocurrency that was stolen from exchanges from 2017 to 2018, almost 65 percent of the total amount. Out of 14 exchange attacks, five were attributed to the group, including the industry record-breaking $532 million NEM hack of Japan’s Coincheck.Electrum servers are still under a sustained Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack. The wallet developers announced the issue on April 7, 2018.In correspondence with Bitcoin Magazine, Electrum developer Thomas Voegtlin speculated that the attack may be a form of retaliation from a phishing attacker who has been targeting Electrum in recent weeks. Since his phishing attacks had been thwarted, the attacker could now be resorting to DoS attacks instead, simply to frustrate Electrum developers and users. Voegtlin pointed out that, if this is the case, the behavior “is not rational” given the incumbent waste of the attacker’s resources.A DoS attack is a fairly straightforward means of disrupting server activity, usually carried out by flooding a server with frivolous requests from a variety of different sources to overwhelm its processing capacity. Attacks of this nature can be carried out by an individual or by a number of actors, as the key method of attack is simply to overwhelm the server itself.When a DoS attack targets a light wallet such as Electrum, it exploits the fact that users do not need to run their own nodes or connect directly to the Bitcoin network and, instead, connect to Electrum servers. By overwhelming these servers with DoS attacks, the wallets become less usable, as it takes a while to find a working server.It’s also possible that the DoS is being carried out by the same person (or group) that was behind the phishing attacks in hopes that the DoS attack will increase the chance that the phishing attack can still succeed this way. As part of the phishing scam, users would connect to fraudulent servers. These fraudulent servers would then send users a phony message asking them to update to a new version of Electrum, sending a link to download coin-stealing malware. Voegtlin speculated that, by adding a DoS attack, the attacker may be hoping to overwhelm the legitimate servers of Electrum, making it more likely that users will inadvertently connect to the malicious servers.Voegtlin suggested that the phishing attack is very unlikely to succeed, however: First, because the phishing attack only works on non-updated Electrum clients, and second, it only works if these clients connect only to malicious servers. Since clients always connect to 10 servers, that is very unlikely, he said. If even one of these servers is non-fraudulent, the phishing attempt will fail.According to Voegtlin, while there is no ETA for the total fix for the DoS attacks, they are already being countered.\"We spawned more servers and we found how to blacklist botnet IP addresses,” he said. “That means some servers are usable now.\" Electrum also plans to ban data-heavy clients as a way of curtailing the processing overload.Updated versions of Electrum are not at risk of the phishing malware, but they can be affected by the DoS attack.For now, Electrum suggests that users \"disable auto-connect and select their server manually.\" Simply waiting a short while often does the trick as well.“Give it time; sometimes it connects after a few minutes,” Voegtlin added. He also advises users to stay on a server that works for them and not switch.Last month, the South Korean exchange Bithumb lost about $13 million worth of cryptocurrency to hackers. While it initially appeared unlikely that the funds would ever be recovered, a recent police raid conducted in South Korea is giving hope that some of the money may be returned.Per reports from a local news outlet, the Cyber ​​Investigation Department of South Korea’s National Police Agency has seized an external server that it believes to be associated with the attack on Bithumb. While at first the theft was believed to be an inside job because no evidence of an external hacker was found, upon closer inspection the police found proof of an external server and IP address that it suspected to be involved. That server has now been found and seized by law enforcement officials.Details are still sketchy about the culprits of the attack and how they managed to steal millions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency, including 3 million EOS tokens. Local officials believe more details may come to light as police analysts search the hard drive of the seized server and find evidence linked to the person or group behind the crime.However, according to the officials involved, it’s not going to be easy. Even though blockchain transactions are transparent, one Korean official noted that it will be challenging to track the crime because the perpetrator has used multiple paths to mask their actions.It won’t help that, globally, many police departments are unequipped to deal with cryptocurrency hacks and that few police officers have a deep understanding of blockchain technology or how it works.If the police are able to determine who committed the attack and zero in on the perpetrator’s exact location, they might be able to make an arrest and recover some of the lost funds.The only upside to this hack is that the funds stolen belonged to the exchange, not customers, so retail investors did not lose their coins. Last year, Bithumb suffered a major security breach, which saw hackers steal $30 million worth of cryptocurrencies belonging to users from its wallets.\n"

Not technology protect activists dissidents , also key securing world ’ digital infrastructure , ” says ProtonMail co-founder Andy Yen . “ This , things considered , strong encryption absolutely necessary greater good. ” The development ProtonMail started 2014 CERN ‒ like development Web ‒ response growing concerns governments spying peaceful citizens ’ email . “ I concerned privacy issue , I wondering I could , ” Yen posted CERN Facebook group . ProtonMail raised first $ 550,000 crowdfunding , followed $ 2 million seed round Charles River Ventures Fongit . Today , ProtonMail one fastest-growing companies Switzerland three offices globally , ranked last year Business Insider hottest startup Switzerland.The decision open ProtonMail motivated increasing trend toward surveillance around world growing efforts undermine online privacy . “ We understand governments concerns comes terrorism encryption , undermining collective security weakening cryptography wrong approach , ” notes announcement. “ The best way ensure encryption privacy rights encroached upon get tools hands public soon possible widely distributing , ” added Yen . “ This way , put choice hands consumer , government regulators . The past decade marked massive erosion privacy ’ working reverse trend . Encrypted communications future ProtonMail committed making online privacy reality Internet users. ” Anyone open ProtonMail account without releasing personal information . Interestingly , sign-up procedure ‒ like ProtonMail ‒ works well Tor . “ Creating free secure email account takes less 2 minutes cases , ” notes ProtonMail signup page . The free service includes 500 megabytes storage , paid services launched recently . The cheapest premium plan , $ 5 per month ( $ 4 per month paid annually ) , includes 5 gigabytes storage custom domain . Current payment options credit cards , PayPal Bitcoin.The Bitcoin payment option complements anonymity signup process possibility sign use ProtonMail Tor . Taken together , features mean anonymous users premium ProtonMail accounts.ProtonMail Swiss company servers located secure data centers Switzerland , protected privacy-friendly Swiss laws . In 2015 , Bitcoin company Xapo relocated corporate headquarters Zurich take advantage privacy-friendly laws . Xapo ’ primary deep cold storage vault already located Switzerland.This one many parallels ProtonMail Bitcoin . ProtonMail wants put privacy back Internet , increasingly controlled governments corporations shown current dispute Apple FBI encrypted communications . Bitcoin , theory permits private payments Internet , also increasingly controlled governments corporations ways void privacy . However , initiatives Zcash promise put private payments back Internet . `` ProtonMail Bitcoin actually long history together , ” Yen told Bitcoin Magazine . “ Back 2014 PayPal instituted payment block us , relied BTC donations keep service running . `` `` We view Apple case troubling , unfortunately , Apple likely lose one court opinion since FBI picked case carefully , ” added Yen . “ However , Apple Lavabit [ encrypted webmail service , used Edward Snowden , shut US government ] , world 's largest tech company standing side privacy , entire movement gained powerful ally . `` Bitcoin embraced many libertarian ideals economic liberty individual sovereignty . But effectively dragged current , public , privacy debate Apple FBI.Last week , President Barack Obama said believes balance must sought privacy security . As one example risks strong encryption , seemingly referring cryptocurrencies , Obama pointed government ca n't access phones , “ everybody walking around Swiss bank account pocket. ” To find Bitcoin 's industry representatives stand issue , Bitcoin Magazine reached Bitcoin Foundation director Bruce Fenton Coin Center director research Peter Van Valkenburgh , senior fellow libertarian think tank Cato institute former Bitcoin Foundation board member Jim Harper.Encryption Law EnforcementThe current debate encryption started recent acts terrorism San Bernardino , California brought highly publicized showdown Apple FBI.After San Bernardino couple , Syed Farook wife , Tashfeen Malik , killed 14 people , FBI found Farook ’ iPhone 5C locked password data encrypted . The action FBI seek decryption terrorist Farook ’ iPhone brought Apple California district court Judge Sheri Pym , ruled Apple offer “ reasonable technical assistance ” law enforcement , must provide tool would allow federal agents beat security feature prevents phone erasing failed unlocking attempts.Apple CEO Tim Cook , however , worries creating patch enable entry back door threatens ability maintain privacy hundreds millions customers worldwide.This sentiment echoed Bitcoin industry representatives.Bitcoin Foundation director Bruce Fenton – also organizes industry 's Satoshi Roundtable – took director foundation last year.Speaking Bitcoin Magazine , stated : “ There believe privacy right believe . I n't support efforts erode privacy claims defense imaginary threats. ” Jim Harper , Cato works adapt law policy information age , wholeheartedly agreed. “ Weakening encryption terrorism investigations , money laundering prevention tax collection would cost lost security everyone would benefit us greater security , crime control fattened government coffers , ” Harper said . “ I 've personally working several years strengthen Fourth Amendment doctrine Supreme Court . My work may help courts recognize conscripting Apple writing code breaks security Fourth Amendment seizure Apple 's resources , unreasonable one. ” Implications BitcoinSeveral Bitcoin wallet apps currently offer “ zero knowledge security ” ensures user data generating private keys completely client side.But happens Pandora ’ Box opened ? What encryption weakened even broken state agencies ? Zeid Ra ’ ad al-Hussein , United Nations high commissioner human rights , sees trying break encryption protecting one phone “ extremely damaging implications ” rights many millions people worldwide , possible effects physical financial security.Obama , meanwhile , seemed suggest kind financial security fact absolute . He believes balance must struck , suggesting encryption weakened allow government agencies access encrypted phones certain cases.Peter Van Valkenburgh , director research Coin Center , doubts technical trade-offs possible all. “ You ca n't weaken encryption , ” explained . “ You weaken ability American companies compete development secure technologies , ability law-abiding American citizens secure tools . If Americans n't build maintain tools , people countries underground economy . Outlawing use development tools hasten demise legitimate institutions would continually fail compete international extralegal institutions hobbled impractical restrictions. ” But indeed technically possible completely shut state agencies phones ? Should considered problem ? Should society concerned citizens walking around Swiss bank accounts pockets , Obama suggested ? Fenton n't believe so. “ My first reaction president 's statement : 'So ? ' Why federal government care people bank account pocket ? That technological achievement , , , nothing close crime government concerned , '' Fenton said.He added : “ It concerning politicians reach far concerns crimes actual victims areas restricting freedom protecting citizens . I think need worry trend government officials push idea citizens privacy control money somehow bad thing . It 's recent years , proliferation credit cards online banking , government become presumptive rights privacy . I think much dangerous whatever drawbacks privacy may have. ” Tax ImplicationsThe main reason Obama used Swiss bank analogy probably tax evasion . Using Bitcoin , becomes increasingly easy users hide vast amounts wealth , enables citizens avoid certain forms tax evasion.Industry representatives actually shared concern – least believe concern valid.Though , according Fenton : “ The tail wag dog regarding taxes Bitcoin . Commerce , innovation jobs come first . The IRS decades deal cash-based economies difficult track real income revenue . They adjust whatever need adapt new technology ; delay impede innovation concern IRS may harder job. “ Harper believes potential tax evasion issues eventually call alternative solutions. “ In decades perhaps even century , Bitcoin successor currencies transaction mechanisms may narrow field taxable transactions , ” said . “ Fully digital transactions fluid catch may lack recognizable physical jurisdiction . This push tax collection toward physical things like housing , durable goods , disposable goods . It 's long way , though , I 'll emphasize. ” Money LaunderingAnother problem often brought regarding Bitcoin money laundering . Increased anonymity inability law enforcement block regulate flow funds enables criminals use Bitcoin nefarious purposes.Fenton : “ People like New York State 's former Superintendent Financial Services Ben Lawsky , 's responsible BitLicense , seem take given indisputable fact money laundering horrible crime . I challenge notion . In cases money laundering clear victim , person people actually harmed . Opportunists make leap saying things like terrorism prevalent money laundering , hogwash . Terrorism risk things like bad foreign policy money laundering . Could technologies like Bitcoin make life easier criminals ? Of course . Just shoes , Internet mobile phones . New technologies make things easier everyone . Regulators thief supporters would better spending time focusing violators law technologies. ” Harper agreed : “ I n't worry degrading governments ' power curtail money laundering regulatory crime , genuine wrong . Money laundering controls probably cost compliance expense curtailed trade ( especially internationally ) provide security , crime control quality-of-life benefits . We 're worse society money laundering laws financial surveillance supports them. ” As , question Bitcoin community protect potential weakening encryption breaches security . Should Bitcoin companies users accept certain trade-offs , move protect ? Harper prefers latter. “ Our best defense going shifting open source , non-proprietary communications transaction tools . Such tools n't head office bought , bullied , required law render insecure . It 's going hard make shift , 's time like present get started , ” said . Zcash , implementation zerocash concept , often referred first form truly anonymous digital cash . While Bitcoin called criminals many misinformed individuals , reality Satoshi Nakamoto ’ creation mostly-transparent ledger.Although Zcash enables highest level privacy currently allowed cryptography , still potential issues ( mostly unrelated privacy ) financial-anonymity protocol overcome . Zcash CEO Zooko Wilcox-O ’ Hearn recently discussed issues Epicenter Bitcoin.Privacy Preserving Spends Take Minute Two GenerateThe main issue Zcash right generating new privacy-preserving spend somewhat inefficient . Zooko , commonly known , explained issue recent Epicenter Bitcoin appearance : “ The current alpha code running testnet ‒ takes like minute two CPU time generate new privacy-preserving spend like milliseconds , I think , verify . The latter part good performance , ’ really important full nodes miners verifications time . The former part pretty bad takes whole minute two like high-powered , supercomputer 64-bit laptop CPU. ” Zooko also added privacy-preserving spend generation likely requires 4 gigabytes RAM , although also mentioned ’ precise measurements RAM requirements quite yet.In regard consequences current system requirements involved privacy-preserving spends , Zooko stated : “ That totally prohibitive certain use cases like generating new spend smartphone , starters . Also , anything ’ got real low-latency requirement get incoming money receive like millisecond later need spend money someone else right away ‒ ’ totally impossible current protocol. ” With current version Zcash , definitely efficiency usability tradeoffs . Having said , system also intended give users highest level financial anonymity privacy.Getting Around Zcash ’ Efficiency IssuesAlthough Zcash ’ privacy-preserving transactions somewhat inefficient , digital currency ’ users also ability make traditional , transparent transactions , similar Bitcoin transactions . Zooko explained using hybrid privacy-preserving transparent transactions Zcash blockchain still offer many advantages traditional Bitcoin transaction . “ The existence privacy-preserving transactions means break links chain transaction history , ” Zcash CEO noted.Zooko also explained combination private non-private transactions would work greater detail : “ There might ways around buffer money spend using privacy-preserving payment , ’ linkage came . Then , privately spend new address . So , ’ linkage blockchain got new address currently controls . Then , could non-private spend directly address. ” Having said , Zooko also stated type usage Zcash blockchain offer greatest level privacy users . He stated : “ Earlier I said , ‘ Zcash offers maximum possible privacy cryptography provide. ’ And true ‒ ever privacy-preserving spends . Then , ’ putting little information possible blockchain. ” Missing Out Some Bitcoin ’ FunctionalityIn addition Zcash ’ efficiency issues , “ HTTPS money ” also enable many useful features Bitcoin subset privacy-preserving transactions . Zooko explained : “ There ’ bunch functionality Bitcoin ‒ globally transparent protocol ‒ ’ privacy-preserving spend ‒ like multisignature transactions . Those really important Bitcoin . There ’ lot really cool things built multisignature transactions. ” He clarified point : “ Zcash multisignature transactions using globally transparent subset protocol , want privacy-preserving spend , ’ multisignature. ” Although still issues Zcash protocol , ’ clear availability truly anonymous cash system desired vast majority digital currency community . This sort cryptographically-ensured privacy become usable time . Perhaps currently-available testnet version Zcash viewed early preview ’ come future privacy-conscious digital currencies.Bitcoin seemingly dragged public debate privacy encryption recently . Specifically , President Barack Obama warned government ca n't access phones , “ ... everybody walking around Swiss bank account pocket , ” appeared refer cryptocurrency.Last week , Bitcoin Magazine reported Bitcoin 's industry representatives positions encryption , privacy , Bitcoin 's role tax evasion money laundering . In part two coverage : What actual builders pocket-sized “ Swiss bank accounts ” think ? Bitcoin Magazine reached Electrum developer Thomas Voegtlin , Breadwallet CEO Aaron Voisine , Mycelium developer Leo Wandersleb Ledger CTO Nicolas Bacca see stand.BrokenThe debate encryption privacy caused ongoing dispute Apple FBI took sharp turn week . The United States Department Justice long claimed unable access encrypted iPhones without help Apple , turned true.Although Department Justice explain got access phone , Bitcoin wallet developers Bitcoin Magazine spoke surprised could.Ledger CTO Nicolas Bacca speculated : “ To get access data , FBI probably relied kind physical attack involving flash memory . Swapping flash memory disabling writes could get infinite retries , brute force access code . The operating system n't handle securely. ” Bacca also pointed Bitcoin much secure typical iPhone. “ I believe Bitcoin less risk physical attacks compared cryptosystems , always get way invalidate possibly compromised key - send coins different address notice quickly enough . The issue properly qualifying long that. ” BalanceWhile FBI demands Apple help government agency access encrypted iPhones , tech company maintains weakening encryption could result privacy disaster . Obama , explaining position last week , argued 's important find right balance privacy security , suggesting weakened encryption option.But option firmly rejected wallet developers Bitcoin Magazine spoke to.Electrum developer Thomas Voegtlin explained : “ In physical world , design door difficult break . This means someone may able force door , covertly , balance privacy security . But computers devices tend make things binary . In world computing , either key , opening door easy , n't , impossible . If give special key government , able open millions doors key , effort , without attracting attention . Nothing prevent someone misusing key , eventually key leaked fall wrong hands . A technological backdoor modern equivalent Ring Gyges. ” Ledger 's Nicolas Bacca agreed. “ As society I believe extremely worried calls weaken encryption , ” Bacca said . “ Practically , done single target , 'NOBUS ' backdoor turns global risk 's discovered . Ideologically , already clear demonstration letting agencies run loose kind absolute power pretty bad idea . Politically , I believe lead important economic collateral damages , another good reason avoid it. ” Voisine agreed assesment well . Moreover , Breadwallet developer argued strong encryption balancing factor widespread data monitoring , factor requires balance. “ Privacy core human experience . Imagine landlord extended family knew exactly much money given time , much spent . It would disaster . Privacy leveler allows parties otherwise unequal bargaining power negotiate equal footing . It ’ even required law many situations , finances publicly traded firms . Intentionally weakened encryption absolutely something worrying . In future world potential ubiquitous surveillance , strong encryption available individuals counterbalancing force , ” Voisine said.TaxationPerhaps main reason Obama cited Swiss bank account example point strong encryption could allow citizens easy escape certain types taxation . More specifically , Bitcoin users potentially store significant amounts wealth phones without government agencies knowing , even able touch it.Mycelium developer Leo Wandersleb , however , questioned whether considered problem all.Wandersleb : “ So Obama worried government might ultimate power citizens ' assets ? Help , assume right power ? I 'm U.S. citizen , excuse I 'm firm regard Constitution amendments ... I know nothing would say 'all property unless government n't agree . ' ” Electrum 's Voegtlin took slightly moderate position. “ I anarchist , involvement Bitcoin motivated anti-government ideology . I believe society government , taxes law enforcement . I write Bitcoin software I believe benefits cryptocurrency , society economies , far outweigh risks . However , denying risks . New technologies always carry new risks. ” But answer combating risks encroach encryption , Voegtlin pointed . Rather , believes risks mitigated alternative means.Voegtlin : “ I think law enforcement taxation need adapt cryptocurrency . In 2011 , Pirate Party founder Rick Falkvinge proposed , world Bitcoin , governments tax consumption , rather wealth income . I believe level thinking appropriate. ” Voisine , , believes answer eventually looked alternative methods taxation. “ There many tax revenue streams difficult avoid even leveling power privacy putting individual equal footing state . Two examples use taxes property taxes . As industry grows world moves wealth Bitcoin , I think see gradual shift toward heavy reliance types income streams state . This added benefit making true cost state services programs transparent . Privacy individuals transparency state wonderful thing. ” SecurityPerhaps unsurprisingly , Bitcoin wallet developers intention weakening security decreasing privacy offer . Rather , intend increase security privacy products possible.Mycelium currently uses server-based model , means governments could potentially pressure wallet provider give certain privacy sensitive information provide false transaction data users.But Wandersleb explained wallet intends improve : “ We working removing equation . Our new wallet depend servers , single point failure . It also open source , even forced weaken product , others could choose distribute reliable versions . Lastly , Mycelium works hardware wallets provide good protection broken operating systems. ” Bacca 's Ledger one companies working Mycelium realize solution . Bacca explained : “ We building additional security layers directly phones , 're also building new hardware wallet device , Ledger Blue . This provides open applications development Secure Element , phone use Bluetooth low-energy . That would close hypothetical doomsday device referred Obama. ” And Voisine , , emphasized privacy security remain top priorities Breadwallet.Voisine : “ A Swiss bank every pocket empowers individual incredible ways 've never seen . It 's time option becomes available whole world , wealthy politically connected , going give them. ” Segregated Witness entered final testing stage roll-out Bitcoin network . That good news , importantly innovation introduces capacity increase allow transactions network , also solves transaction malleability.And , introduces script versioning ‒ extension Bitcoin protocol allows entire new category innovation.One imminent innovations top several Bitcoin developers ’ wish-lists time : Schnorr signatures.With impending release Segregated Witness , implementation Schnorr cryptographic signature algorithm might follow soon , potentially improving Bitcoin 's scalability , efficiency privacy , one go.Here 's how.SignaturesFirst , brief re-cap : signatures ? At heart Bitcoin lies mathematical trick called “ public key cryptography , ” cryptographic system uses two kinds “ keys ” ( really strings numbers ) : private keys public keys.A private key public key mathematically linked . But 's easy produce public key private key , 's practically impossible produce private key public key . It 's “ one-way street. ” In order spend bitcoins particular Bitcoin address , one must prove “ ownership ” ( : knowledge ) private key refers public key associated address . And prove ownership private key , without reveal private key , cryptographic signature used.A signature created performing calculation using transaction data private key . And 's magic public key cryptography comes : Knowing public key , anyone see correct private key used create signature . Without ever needing know private key itself.The “ owner ” private key therefore sign transaction spend bitcoins without worrying someone else take private key steal bitcoins ; private key never exposed , signature valid specific transaction . ( For elaborate explanation public key cryptography Bitcoin , see article . Or , keep reading . While basic signature concept matters , details crucial purpose article . ) SchnorrSo , , Schnorr signatures ? Schnorr , named inventor Claus-Peter Schnorr , signature scheme : series mathematical rules link private key , public key signature together . Many cryptographers consider Schnorr signatures best field , offer strong level correctness , suffer malleability , relatively fast verify , ‒ importantly ‒ support multisignature : several signatures aggregated single , new signature.However , possible utilize Schnorr Bitcoin . Another type signature scheme , Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm ( ECDSA ) , baked Bitcoin protocol , changing would require hard fork.That 's Segregated Witness comes in.With Segregated Witness , signature data moved separate part transaction : witness , embedded “ old ” Bitcoin protocol . And thanks script versioning , almost rule applied witness changed soft fork . Including type signature scheme used.This opens door Schnorr.CapacityThe Schnorr property stands benefit Bitcoin multisignature aggregation.Many Bitcoin transactions include multiple inputs , referring addresses bitcoins sent . ( This compared cash payments often consist multiple smaller bills coins pay larger sum money . ) Right , inputs require signature , means signatures must included transaction , must transmitted network , must included block.With Schnorr , however , inputs instead require one combined signature represent different signatures . This offers obvious data advantage , one signature must included transaction , one must transmitted network , one must included block . This means 's room transactions.For example : Segregated Witness , proposed Bitcoin Core , offers ( roughly ) 75 percent discount data included witness rather original block . One megabyte witness data therefore “ weighed ” .25 megabyte , would leave room .75 megabyte transaction data original block , total 1 megabyte.If aggregated Schnorr signatures reduce total size witness data , say 1 megabyte .5 megabyte , .5 megabyte would discounted 0.125 megabyte , leaving room 0.875 megabyte original block . ( A capacity increase 17 percent . ) The exact amount added room depends types transactions included blocks . But rough estimates Bitcoin Core developer Eric Lombrozo suggest Schnorr signatures could eventually increase total capacity 40 percent – ’ top added 60 100 percent already offered Segregated Witness.MultisigThe capacity increase described true regular transactions , many transactions include one input . But advantage even greater case multisig transactions ‒ transactions single input requires several signatures ( typically different people ) .As normal transactions , single signature needs included multisig transaction . No matter many signatures required , matter many people involved.This opens door vastly complex smart contract constructions , fraction data normally required . Whether 's two-of-three , three-of-fifteen hundred-of-hundred types multisig transactions , carry amount signature data typical single-signature transaction.PrivacyAnd third , Schnorr signatures could offer another interesting benefit : incentivized privacy.As mentioned , one transaction include multiple inputs . Most commonly , inputs refer addresses controlled person . ( As per multiple bills coins example . ) But privacy-enhancing trick invented Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell , CoinJoin , allows different users combine transactions single transaction . That one transaction include multiple inputs coming different payers , sends money multiple outputs , belonging different payees . ( This compared group people throwing bills coins together basket , use go shopping different stores buy products want . Each individual get goods individual paid , 's unlikely individual 's “ ” bill paid product individual bought . ) If done right , CoinJoin great way improve privacy Bitcoin protocol , becomes unclear inputs paid outputs exactly , let alone person paid person.CoinJoin new concept . But CoinJoin typically bit hassle . As , people n't bother . And since people n't bother , bother could automatically marked suspicious ; potentially defeating purpose using CoinJoin first place.But Schnorr signatures add new advantage CoinJoin . It enables participants CoinJoin transaction combine transactions , also combine signatures . And means size transaction would actually smaller individual transactions combined . Which , turn , means miners would typically charge smaller fee process transaction.With Schnorr , therefore , CoinJoin would increase privacy , also – importantly – lower costs everyone involved . Indeed , would cost benefit use private option , might make go-to option everyone – vastly increasing Bitcoin privacy all.Although one may assume demand privacy Bitcoin blockchain-based systems coming crypto-anarchists libertarians , reality huge push concealing transactions blockchain coming traditional financial industry . During recent cryptocurrency event Cato Institute , Zcash CEO longtime cypherpunk Zooko Wilcox-O ’ Hearn made point banks , clearinghouses , payment processors everyone else ’ talked financial industry ones asking privacy blockchain.Financial Industry Willing Help Bring Privacy BlockchainsDuring panel focused financial privacy recent Cato event , Zooko made clear vast majority push enhanced privacy blockchain coming banks , dismissal push privacy coming users . Zooko claimed increase privacy solutions blockchain technologies past six 12 months reaction demand coming various financial institutions. “ There lot demand among users , I ’ know much ’ willing stump . Whereas financial industry appears [ ready ] , ” Zooko said.Why Is Financial Industry Demanding Privacy ? Zooko pointed two main reasons banks financial institutions need privacy blockchain ’ going use : Banks thinking using blockchains lower costs , also understand technology could disrupt industry . The idea saving money obviously attractive , disruptive properties public ledgers forcing financial services companies pay close attention blockchain ecosystem.Financial institutions understand pervasive lack privacy shared ledgers roadblock use blockchains industry.In Zooko ’ view , use cases make sense financial industry , trading settlement , require flexible layers privacy allow specific individuals organizations access data related transaction. “ For regulatory business reasons , ’ going shared database financial information , use case I ’ found yet ’ OK everyone accesses database able read financial information database. ” Removing Read-Access BlockchainZooko also noted true innovation Bitcoin way altered read-and-write-access works financial ledgers . He explained : “ Bitcoin really innovative made write-access cryptographic instead centralized ‒ ’ basically important thing Bitcoin . At time , made read-access ubiquitous ‒ everyone read everything time . So next step ’ cusp making read-access cryptographic ... appears necessary applications blockchains different [ companies ] financial industry. ” Zooko added company ’ Zerocash-based blockchain allow creator transaction choose else see details transaction public ledger . Confidential Transactions Enigma two privacy-focused blockchain improvements mentioned Zooko event.The Lightning Network may well Bitcoin ’ primary solution issue scalability , many skeptics believe unresolved issues layer-2 system blockchain . The possibility much centralization via so-called “ supernodes ” one common criticisms Lightning Network , attached fear new , mostly -centralized payment hubs capacity censor transactions.Bitcoin Magazine recently reached BitGo Engineer Statoshi.info creator Jameson Lopp get thoughts possible privacy issues associated Lightning Network.Lightning Network May Offer Better PrivacyAlthough loss privacy sometimes mentioned possible , negative aspect Lightning Network , reality may offer better privacy current base layer Bitcoin blockchain . This mainly due fact blockchain open , mostly -transparent ledger viewed anyone via block explorer.Lopp made point interview Bitcoin Magazine : “ I expect privacy actually better Lightning Network on-chain transactions broadcast entire network . It much harder collect analytics Lightning Network routing nodes know hop hop routing , entire route. ” Although perfect , Lightning Network offer advantage keeping information related specific transactions away open , transparent ledger . Whether Lightning Network offer better privacy traditional bank account ( bank parties involved transaction know ) unknown point.Will Nodes Be Forced Comply AML KYC Laws ? One main concerns associated Lightning Network entities running nearly nodes nodes forced comply Anti Money Laundering ( AML ) Know Your Customer ( KYC ) regulations . To point , Lopp responded , “ I understand AML/KYC fear , routing nodes non-custodial. ” Lopp went explain BitGo based business around non-custodial means ’ deal regulatory issues associated holding user funds.The BitGo engineer also noted Lightning Network could still operate environment laws changed fit regulation-avoiding model . Lopp believes , much like Internet , users could simply go around nodes onerous requirements routing payments . He added , “ In [ scenario ] , 'll still see plenty non-compliant nodes. ” A Never-Ending Battle Privacy vs. SurveillanceIt ’ possible battle privacy surveillance never end . Having said , attempting break privacy Internet usually responding new technologies created privacy-minded individuals organizations.At point , appears attack level privacy offered Lightning Network would similar attack Tor network . Lopp told Bitcoin Magazine , “ I imagine would need well-funded attacker order able watch significant portion traffic. ” Blockstream ’ Rusty Russell Lightning ’ Olaoluwa Osuntokun working bringing onion routing Lightning Network , ’ clear privacy given utmost respect developers working project. “ I foresee Tor-style arms race future two fronts , ” Russell told Bitcoin Magazine . “ One battle analytics ( timing attacks ) bugs . The centralization , Bitcoin learning , hard problem , mainly met ( 1 ) making easy decentralize , ( 2 ) making sure people aware danger. ” There always tradeoffs privacy usability . Zcash appears privacy-conscious blockchain today , issues system comes efficiency . Open Transactions could also used implement truly anonymous digital cash , federated server model system secure blockchain ( even Lightning Network ) comes control one ’ funds.Bitcoin right really anonymous . While Bitcoin addresses n't necessarily linked real-world identities , . Monitoring unencrypted peer-to-peer network , analysis public blockchain , Know Your Customer ( KYC ) policy Anti-Money Laundering ( AML ) regulation reveal lot 's using Bitcoin , what.This great privacy perspective . Bitcoin users might necessarily want world know spend money , earn much , businesses may want leak transaction details competitors – name examples . Additionally , bitcoins traceable , possibly “ tainted , ” potentially worth less bitcoins odds fungibility . This could even challenge Bitcoin 's value proposition money.But potential solutions increase privacy , improve fungibility . One solutions “ Confidential Transactions. ” BackgroundAs opposed digital financial infrastructure , typical Bitcoin transactions recorded public blockchain , visible anyone see . This required validate transactions without centralized authority , also makes trivial trace many bitcoins sent addresses addresses.To enhance privacy , possible hide amount bitcoins transacted . An early version concept , referred “ bitcoins homomorphic value , ” first proposed 2013 hashcash inventor current Blockstream president Dr. Adam Back . The idea later picked Bitcoin Core Blockstream developers Gregory Maxwell Dr. Pieter Wuille Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra . This eventually led implementation Confidential Transactions Blockstream 's testnet-sidechain , Alpha.How It WorksConfidential Transactions combine utilize several cryptographic tricks , notably Borromean ring signatures Pedersen commitment schemes.Without diving deep cryptographic specifics , tricks applied sender receiver transaction aware amount transacted . Everyone else would see bitcoins transacted , know many.The clever thing , amounts masked “ onlookers , ” onlookers still use masked amounts certain types calculations . Specifically , inputs transaction added , outputs added , two sums compared ensure ’ equal ‒ never revealing masked amounts , sums . As , nodes verify bitcoins created thin air , without knowing many bitcoins actually sent . ( On side note , one amounts always visible : mining fee . That 's ensure miners ca n't award many fees , consequences privacy perspective . Other amounts made visible well , sender receiver chooses . ) Soft ForkPerhaps surprisingly , Confidential Transactions would less compatible current Bitcoin-protocol . While specifics need fleshed , solution rolled soft fork ‒ though might bit “ hacky. ” Here 's how.To ensure “ old ” ( non-upgraded ) “ new ” ( upgraded ) nodes would remain sync , bitcoins used Confidential Transaction would first “ pass ” “ anyone-can-spend ” address . This Bitcoin address anyone spend , even without corresponding private key signature.Or seems old nodes.New nodes would recognize address first step Confidential Transaction , would accept transactions address include correct signature . As long majority hash power applies rules , bitcoins anyone-can-spend address stolen anyone ’ control corresponding private key . ( Old nodes might wonder one spending freely available bitcoins . But also would n't mind one ; perspective , protocol rules broken . ) Here 's gets interesting.If Confidential Transaction made anyone-can-spend address , old nodes new nodes see transaction . But see something different . New nodes would recognize transaction Confidential Transaction , , example , check bitcoins created thin air . Old nodes , meanwhile , would tricked thinking 's zero-bitcoin transaction : would believe bitcoins left anyone-can-spend address all.This logic holds subsequent transaction . New nodes would see new transactions , know amount bitcoin probably moved address address – though 'd idea many . Old nodes , , see “ zero-bitcoin transactions , ” believe bitcoins still sitting anyone-can-spend address . ( Old nodes might wonder people sending empty transactions . But , would n't mind . ) The reason wo n't cause havoc ( specifically due incompatible UTXO-sets ) bitcoins received Confidential Transaction initially spent Confidential Transaction . They “ locked ” anyone-can-spend address , visibly move Bitcoin blockchain all.In order able spend bitcoins normal transaction , must first “ pass ” original anyone-can-spend address . The receiver Confidential Transaction would send back anyone-can-spend address , start moving coins clear sight blockchain again.Once start moving clear sight , new nodes would check many coins moved , old nodes would simply assume coins moving first time since “ locked up. ” As , anyone-can-spend address effectively functions cloaking device . Passing anyone-can-spend address makes amounts subsequent transactions invisible nodes . The bitcoins would “ re-appear ” ’ made back original anyone-can-spend address.Downsides Trade-offsUnfortunately , Confidential Transactions silver bullet privacy.Most obviously , Confidential Transactions mask amounts , onlookers still see address paying address.But potential solutions solve well.For one , 's trivial create false negatives pay zero bitcoins several addresses obfuscate bitcoins really went . Additionally , Confidential Transactions could particularly useful combination CoinJoin , combines sending receiving addresses several transactions single , large transaction.Another potential weakness Confidential Transactions masked amounts really masked particular transaction . This rather pointless subsequent transaction Confidential Transaction . The information later transactions sometimes used retroactively calculate many bitcoins must involved Confidential Transaction . ( For example : If Alice sends unknown amount bitcoins Bob , Bob subsequently sends 5 bitcoins Carol 2 change , obviously means Alice sent 7 bitcoins Bob . ) This means Confidential Transactions really useful use widespread . But brings us perhaps even bigger problem : Confidential Transactions quite resource-heavy . A Confidential Transaction 20 times bigger normal transaction , even increases computation thirtyfold . As , cost Confidential Transaction would significantly higher compared typical transactions , provides disincentive people actually using – diminishing usefulness everyone else well.On top , sheer size Confidential Transactions puts odds either scalability ( Bitcoin network would able handle fewer transactions ) , decentralization ( fewer users would able run full node verify transactions ) , both.And last least : It 's clear everyone agrees Bitcoin private fungible , might complicate rolling potential soft forks like these.Microsoft announced collaborating Blockstack Labs , ConsenSys developers across globe open source , self-sovereign , blockchain-based identity system allows people , products , apps services interoperate across blockchains , cloud providers organizations.The United Nation 's Sustainable Development Goals include giving everyone legal identity 2030 . As first step , U.N. wants develop scalable identity systems 2020 . The inaugural `` ID2020 Summit ‒ Harnessing Digital Identity Global Community , '' held United Nations headquarters New York May 20 , brought together policymakers technology companies develop action plan. “ While ’ profess solutions overwhelming problems today , start open source community best : collaboration , ” said Yorke Rhodes III , blockchain business strategist Microsoft . “ To progress toward goals , working partners address identity using self-owned self-sovereign qualities blockchain technology. ” The Microsoft strategist said Redmond , Washington , giant working Blockstack Labs ConsenSys leverage current Bitcoin Ethereum-based identity solutions , Blockstack uPort . Through open source collaboration , Microsoft partners intend produce cross-chain identity solution extended future blockchains new kinds decentralized , distributed systems . In coming weeks open-source framework developers made available Azure.Blockstack ‒ open source blockchain application stack ‒ permits building decentralized , serverless apps plugging Blockstack 's services identity , naming , storage authentication.According Blockstack team , Blockstack largest , popular blockchain identity system , 50,000 registered identities come profiles globally unique names . Identities registered people , companies , websites , software packages . Profiles contain private public information , attested user verified peers select authorities. “ Microsoft make easy deploy new Blockstack servers infrastructure Azure cloud plans integrate Blockstack internal systems identity authentication , ” notes Blockstack blog . “ With Blockstack technology users complete control usernames data ’ need trust third party information . We appreciate Microsoft ’ committed making internet secure user-centric place promote open-source software development. ” In November Bitcoin Magazine reported Microsoft partnered ConsenSys , blockchain startup focused Ethereum technology , founded October 2014 Ethereum Foundation ’ co-founder Joseph Lubin . In December , Microsoft ConsenSys announced Ethereum Blockchain Service ( EBaaS ) Microsoft Azure , provide single-click cloud-based blockchain developer environment Azure Enterprise clients developers . In October , ConsenSys revealed working identity management system called uPort . “ [ We ] started integrate ID persona construct across dApps , ” noted ConsenSys blog . “ Soon uPort persona enable access dApp ConsenSys developers build . ConsenSys begun efforts work various partners towards standardization components. ” The company added user-owned ID data crucial realizing compelling vision Web 3.0. “ We ’ also collaborating ConsenSys cross-blockchain solution global namespaces , ” notes Blockstack blog . “ We believe global identity system dependent particular blockchain users able migrate one blockchain another , needed . Along lines , plan work ConsenSys add Ethereum support Blockstack server. ” Redmond Magazine notes many unofficial identity systems social media world , including systems operated Google , Facebook Microsoft , well various emerging blockchain-based platforms proposed online world . But U.N. companies participated inaugural ID2020 Summit ambitious : They want develop globally recognized identity systems real world.One-fifth world ’ population ‒ one half billion people ‒ without proper identification , 50 million children born every year without birth certificate legal identity . These numbers growing , underlines importance U.N. goal giving everyone planet solid tamper-proof digital identity based common , interoperable standards . According John Farmer , director technology civic innovation Microsoft , blockchain technology offer three key features identity system : It 's immutable , trustless , transparent agreed-upon network. “ [ We ] imagine world individual register identity cross blockchain fashion , providing single namespace lookup regardless blockchain choice , ” concludes Microsoft announcement . “ [ We ] excited potential societal benefits derived identity transcends borders , blockchains , organizations companies. ” Bitcoin right really anonymous . While Bitcoin addresses n't necessarily linked real-world identities , . Monitoring unencrypted peer-to-peer network , analysis public blockchain , Know Your Customer ( KYC ) policy Anti-Money Laundering ( AML ) regulation reveal lot 's using Bitcoin , what.This great privacy perspective . Bitcoin users might necessarily want world know spend money , earn much , businesses may want leak transaction details competitors – name examples.Additionally , bitcoins traceable , possibly “ tainted , ” potentially worth less bitcoins odds fungibility . This could even challenge Bitcoin 's value proposition money.But potential solutions increase privacy , improve fungibility.One solutions BIP 151 , Bitcoin Improvement Proposal designed encrypt data among Bitcoin nodes.The ProblemTraffic Bitcoin network always unencrypted . Transactions blocks sent node node plain sight , Bloom filters , often used Simplified Payment Verification ( SPV ) nodes . All data , therefore , seen Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) , open-WiFi providers anyone monitoring Bitcoin network.This obvious downsides . In case full nodes ( miners ) , information transactions blocks originate link Bitcoin addresses IP addresses , used de-anonymize users . Moreover , ISPs open-WiFi providers potentially use data block certain transactions , instance send bitcoins blacklisted address.Most SPV-wallets ( lightweight clients – particular based Bitcoinj-library ) additional problem . To check funds , wallets send so-called Bloom filters , mathematical trick aggregates data compact package . Unfortunately , proved insecure privacy perspective : The packages used reconstruct Bitcoin-addresses belong wallet-user.While solutions available encrypt data nodes already , obviously Tor VPN , ideal . For one , solutions n't work “ out-of-the-box ” ‒ require extra software sometimes special ports . Second , users typically need rely infrastructure people outside Bitcoin system ( particular Tor exit nodes ) . And 's typically hit performance well.The SolutionBIP 151 , designed recently proposed Bitcoin Core developer Jonas Schnelli , straightforward solution : It encrypts traffic nodes.To avoid potential security risks posed much common TLS/SSL cryptographic standard , BIP 151 proposes use cryptographic standard known “ ChaCha20/Poly1305 @ openssh. ” This standard already used OpenSSH Google-API , among projects , generally considered well-proved . It offers added advantage speeding network traffic ; Bitcoin messages currently include SHA256-hash ( another cryptographic standard ) content , relatively “ heavy ” compute.With ChaCha20/Poly1305 @ openssh , anyone monitoring network could still recognize packages Bitcoin data . But would know content data . This automatically improves privacy . Additionally , becomes harder censor specific transactions blocks : ISPs open-WiFi providers censor Bitcoin-data , none it.RealizationWhile BIP 151 proposed quite recently , review process started , yet little reason think ca n't safely deployed Bitcoin network.In fact , since BIP 151 impact Bitcoin 's consensus layer , miner , node wallet network opt solution time – even miners , nodes wallet n't . ( If one connected nodes ’ apply BIP 151 , data simply transmitted plain text – , course , mean privacy censorship-resistant benefits ’ hold either . ) However , solution might completely airtight . It could , least theory , possible , example , analyze encrypted data conclude big message . Comparing data appears mempools blockchain might reveal data sent specific node . But , problem probably negligible – would still impossible censor specific content pro-actively.And , course , BIP 151 n't make Bitcoin private fungible ; 's mere part puzzle . Perhaps relevant improvement rolled alongside BIP 151 solution node authentication ensure connected peer genuine node , ISP WiFi-provider disguised one . Schnelli currently working solution ensure node authentication well.Bitcoin right really anonymous . While Bitcoin addresses n't necessarily linked real-world identities , . And ’ possible learn lot ’ using Bitcoin , , monitoring unencrypted peer-to-peer network analysis public blockchain , well Know Your Customer ( KYC ) Anti-Money Laundering ( AML ) regulations.This great privacy perspective . Bitcoin users might necessarily want world know spend money , earn much , businesses may want leak transaction details competitors – name examples.Additionally , selected bitcoins traceable , possibly “ tainted ” potentially worth less bitcoins odds fungibility . These privacy-related issues could even challenge Bitcoin 's value proposition money.But potential solutions increase privacy improve fungibility.One oldest tricks book coin mixing . More recently , trick dusted , improved re-introduced form “ coin shuffle ” protocols.Traditional MixingThe concept mixing coins complicated.If two people wish obfuscate trails coins control , simply exchange coins one another . Each participant exchange end controlling coins history 's , ridding coins reflect activity.The straightforward way mix coins users simply connect , instance internet forum , agree send specific amounts coins . However , option obvious downsides . Not must two users wish exchange coins less time ( able find ) ‒ must also trust run coins receiving them.Alternatively , users mix coins dedicated mixer , typically hosted central server . This concept straightforward , : users send coins mixer , mixer sends different coins back – usually minus mixing fee . Several mixers already exist , bitmixer.io . Some dark net markets use built-in mixers , too.Unfortunately , centralized mixers suffer obvious weaknesses . For one , counterparty risk still exists : Whoever controls mixer must trusted actually send bitcoins back . Meanwhile , privacy fungibility problem entirely solved either : Whoever controls mixer knows exactly coins exchanged coins , therefore re-establish trail.There ’ alternate solution CoinJoin . CoinJoin allows users obfuscate Bitcoin trails outside world essentially combining several transactions single big transaction . This makes unclear addresses sent bitcoins addresses since “ ” “ ” addresses lumped together.But CoinJoin , trails necessarily obfuscated participants transaction . After , order create CoinJoin transaction , ( ) participants must able see addresses sending bitcoins addresses.This problem CoinShuffle protocols solve.CoinShuffleCoinShuffle major breakthrough first proposed researchers Saarland University 2014 , potential decentralize mixing extent one needed trust anyone else.As typical CoinJoin transactions , CoinShuffle allows different users submit output addresses included single transaction order obfuscate trails.The innovation introduced CoinShuffle users submit output address , without revealing anyone else specific address submitted . As result , participants know addresses receiving bitcoins – one know addresses bitcoins sent.This achieved clever protocol.In short , participants generate unique public key ( random string numbers ) others encrypt data , corresponding private key decrypt . Along predetermined ( random ) order , participants pass public keys around , way one user ends public keys , one user ends all-but-one , way user actually got none them.The user got public keys encrypts output address public keys , one one , right sequence . These layers encryption decrypted private keys , one one , right order . This package handed next user , public keys except one.This user decrypts package private key ; “ peels ” one layer encryption-onion , still ca n't tell output address “ hidden underneath. ” Additionally , encrypts output address public keys ( one ) , passes encrypted packages next user . This next user idea package originally came user . But peel another encryption layer . And , course , encrypt output address public keys got , pass three encrypted packages next.This goes last user , gets packages containing output addresses , encrypted . But point , packages one layer encryption left ; last user decrypt . He adds output address mix , constructs one big CoinJoin transaction , sends back participants sign.At point , participants simply verify output addresses included transaction , sign broadcast transaction . ( It n't really matter broadcasts , exactly . ) No one ever know provided output address.The much-used Mycelium Bitcoin wallet might soon include implementation CoinShuffle protocol , Mycelium named Shufflepuff.CoinShuffle++While CoinShuffle works intended , protocol requires significant number steps complete , makes somewhat impractical day-to-day use . The researchers Saarland University , therefore , recently proposed improved solution : CoinShuffle++ . CoinShuffle++ essentially CoinShuffle , faster better.Where participants CoinShuffle generate public private key pairs , participants CoinShuffle++ transaction create “ mutual secrets ” ‒ also unique strings numbers . Each participant shares string every participant , shared secret shared among two ; , less.All participants “ mask ” output using secrets share . But importantly , shared secrets used negative values well positive values pair participants . ( If one participant masks output shared secret 12345 , participant masks output -12345 . ) This allows nifty trick , descibed Dining cryptographers problem . Once participants share masked outputs , combine way shared secrets cancel . What 's left , point , grand combination outputs – unmasked.The next challenge extract specific outputs combination outputs . That 's another mathematical trick comes play : so-called Newton Identities . The technical details trick unfortunately beyond scope article , wanders far complexity advanced mathematics . But essentially accomplished using several different redundant encodings message , participants apply locally extract original output addresses – without knowing provided address.And importantly , done single go , make much faster efficient original CoinShuffle protocol . According Saarland University researchers , 50 participants may complete CoinShuffle++ protocol 15 seconds ; potentially even fast enough typical point-of-sale situations.Trade-Offs WeaknessesLike anonymizing solutions , CoinShuffle protocols improve privacy fungibility . But insufficient provide full anonymity fungibility – free weakness.As one drawback CoinShuffle protocols , frustrated dishonest participants . If even one participants wants block successful “ shuffle ” insert “ fake ” ( encrypted ) data process ( partake part process ) .It , however , possible trace participant trying frustrate protocol . As , protocol trivially restarted without specific participant . This increases total time mixing , mixing complete.Additionally , many weaknesses pertain typical CoinJoin transactions hold shuffle protocols well . Most important , different amounts sent collective transaction n't equal , might possible figure inputs outputs correspond – defeating purpose entirely.Likewise , “ participants ” really one entity pretending several – Sybil attack – amount mixing make difference : one entity simply connect inputs outputs n't his.Bitcoin right really anonymous . While Bitcoin addresses n't necessarily linked real-world identities , . Monitoring unencrypted peer-to-peer network , analysis public blockchain know customer ( KYC ) policy anti-money laundering ( AML ) regulation reveal lot 's using Bitcoin what.This ideal privacy perspective . To show examples ; Bitcoin users might want world know spend money , earn much , businesses may want leak transaction details competitors.Additionally , bitcoins traceable , possibly “ tainted ” potentially worth less bitcoins odds fungibility . This could even challenge Bitcoin 's value proposition money.One solution increase privacy protect fungibility exchange bitcoins fiat currency without required identify yourself.The ProblemExchanges , brokerages , money transmitters service providers serve “ on-ramps ” “ off-ramps ” bitcoin fiat currency , form important part Bitcoin ecosystem . But privacy fungibility perspective , heavy reliance companies ideal : Practically fiat-facing bitcoin-companies required apply AML/KYC-checks customers.Moreover , checks ( sometimes ) combined wider blockchain-analysis , pertaining past trail bitcoins , cases even monitor bitcoins move leaving services . This allows extensive mapping Bitcoin ecosystem . ( In recent blog post , R3CEV Director Market Research Tim Swanson even described “ de facto Kimberley Process ” . ) There ways avoid kinds checks . Most obviously , users exchange bitcoins fiat outside exchange , example , Bitcoin meetups . But becomes bit tricky online : Users need trust counterparty maybe dedicated middleman actually send bitcoins wire fiat currency . Alternatively , converting bitcoins fiat currency done purchasing Bitcoin debit cards Cryptopay BitPlastic . Converting fiat currency bitcoins , vouchers Bitupcard may also offer solution.Most options , however , rather expensive , clunky both.Local ExchangeA perhaps sophisticated solution use exchanges n't require identity-checks ; several.The earliest alternatives Finland-based exchange LocalBitcoins , launched 2012 . As opposed typical exchanges , LocalBitcoins platform touch fiat currency . Instead , users send fiat typical wire transfers methods . And , name website suggests , users also meet locally trade bitcoins cash spot . This allows LocalBitcoins lenient comes AML/KYC-policies – although sellers require counterparty identify LocalBitcoins-platform degree . ( In United States , LocalBitcoins.com sellers charged anti-money laundering laws . ) Building concept 2014 , Mycelium mobile Bitcoin wallet introduced Local Trader : Bitcoin exchange built right wallet . Mycelium users want buy sell bitcoins cash make offer Mycelium platform indicate price maximum distance ’ willing travel . Once match made another trader , meet complete trade locally , typically cash . The Bitcoin side trade taken care in-app , also includes reputation system.Decentralized ExchangeHowever , even fiat side trade handled locally , LocalBitcoins Mycelium types solutions still rely central intermediary extent : LocalBitcoins Mycelium . And end , companies required apply AML/KYC-types regulation well - shut entirely . ( LocalBitcoins cease operations Germany back 2014 . ) An interesting alternative , therefore , fully decentralized exchanges rely central intermediary process fiat Bitcoin transactions.A first attempt establishing decentralized exchange Coinffeine , launched late 2013 . Coinfeinne partly solved counterparty risk – risk trading partner paying – combination security deposits incremental trading protocol . In short , parties trade , deposit specific amount bitcoins two-of-two multi-address , requiring signature unlock . Subsequently , trading partners trade incremental amounts : single trade bigger security deposit . As , neither trader incentive pay part : would lose security deposit worth amount did.Coinfeinne novel idea , n't hold nicely practice . The security deposits leave room certain types fraud extortion . A victim might , instance , prefer get half deposit back rather nothing . Additionally , trading incremental amounts exactly user-friendly fast , especially takes wire transfer complete time.More recently , decentralized Bitcoin exchange Bitsquare launched . Bitsquare solved counterparty problem dedicated arbiters , well – – security deposits . These deposits locked along traded bitcoins two-of-three multisig address third key held dedicated mutually agreed upon arbiter . As , buyer incentivized send fiat currency ; 'll lose deposit otherwise . And receives fiat curremcy , seller incentivized release bitcoins reason . If either attempts cheat , arbitrator helps victim get bitcoins . To prevent bank-chargeback fraud , Bitsquare limits trades maximum .75 1.5 , now.Bitcoin , right , really anonymous . While Bitcoin addresses n't necessarily linked real-world identities , . Monitoring unencrypted peer-to-peer network , analysis public blockchain know customer ( KYC ) policy anti-money laundering ( AML ) regulation reveal lot 's using bitcoin what.This great privacy perspective . Bitcoin users might necessarily want world know spend money , earn much , businesses may want leak transaction details competitors , name examples.Additionally , bitcoins traceable , possibly “ tainted , ” potentially worth less bitcoins odds fungibility . This could even challenge bitcoin 's value proposition money.But potential solutions increase privacy improve fungibility.One solution address issue – Stealth Transactions – introduced 2014 ; new twist concept – Reusable Payment Codes – proposed last year.The ProblemIn part increase privacy ( security benefits well ) , recommended Bitcoin users generate brand new address transaction receive . While airtight solution , make significantly harder connect addresses real world identities ‒ sending receiving end transaction.However , also means receiver must share new Bitcoin address sender time transaction made . This bit hassle cases even impossible ( think donation addresses posted websites ) . And ’ ideal privacy perspective either : If new addresses shared insecure channel , privacy potentially lost entirely.Stealth Transactions , first proposed 2014 Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd , designed solve problems . They use several cryptographic tricks , mostly based Diffie-Hellman key exchange , let users accept payments addresses never generated , even seen before.Under HoodThis Stealth Transactions work “ hood. ” [ Authors note : Since completion article , brought attention actually several slightly different ways construct Stealth Transactions . The strategy described one particular option . ] Stealth Transactions require sender receiver transaction ( basically non-Bitcoin-related ) cryptographic public private key pair , . We 'll call “ stealth private keys ” “ stealth public keys. ” These “ stealth keys ” used several ways.The first way fairly basic use-case cryptography , , example , used encrypt emails . In short ( bit simplified ) , sender take receiver 's stealth public key use encrypt message . The receiver – receiver – able decrypt message stealth private key . ( This works way around well , course : The receiver could encrypt message sender – 's really relevant Stealth Transactions . ) The second trick slightly complex . But , , simplified form , stealth private keys combined mathematical formula , create Bitcoin private key . This Bitcoin private key , turn , used generate corresponding Bitcoin address . So , using ’ stealth private key combination , sender receiver generate Bitcoin private key Bitcoin address.And third trick , simplified form : This Bitcoin address ( corresponding Bitcoin private key ) also derived one stealth private keys one stealth public keys . As , either sender receiver generate Bitcoin address combining stealth private key 's stealth public key.In PracticeTo make Stealth Transaction , three tricks cleverly combined : Possibly even payment going made , receiver generates stealth key pair . It 's stealth public key , example , posts website donation address . ( As , ’ also called “ Stealth Address. ” ) He n't share stealth private key anyone all.When sender wants pay receiver , generates “ throwaway ” stealth private key ; specifically one transaction . ( It ’ actually “ nonce ” ; random string numbers – effect . ) He takes receiver 's stealth public key ( Stealth Address ) combines throwaway stealth private key , generate Bitcoin address sends bitcoins Bitcoin address . ( Well , almost ... let 's assume moment . ) At point , one spend bitcoins address one knows ( able generate ) corresponding Bitcoin private key.But 's heart trick : sender allow receiver spend bitcoins sharing throwaway stealth private key . With throwaway stealth private key , receiver would stealth private keys required generate Bitcoin private key.Interestingly , accomplished , within transaction funds Bitcoin address . Specifically , sender includes so-called OP_RETURN “ message ” transaction . This message consists throwaway private key , encrypted using receiver 's public key , one receiver decrypt it.To receive transaction , receiver monitors blockchain OP_RETURN transactions tries decrypt . Once finds decryptable OP-RETURN message , also finds throwaway stealth private key combine stealth private key , generate Bitcoin private key spend bitcoins transaction.The receiver received secure payment address n't even actual payment made . Meanwhile , outside world might even know Stealth Transaction ; see normal Bitcoin-transaction undecipherable OP_RETURN message attached.Reusable Payment CodesWhile Stealth Transactions offer novel solution , requirement monitor blockchain OP_RETURN transactions limit potential . Specifically , light wallets typically n't store entire blockchain , therefore , unable receive Stealth Transactions . ( DarkWallet , wallet allows Stealth Transactions far , “ outsources ” task server , ideal privacy . ) Reusable Payment Codes , introduced Bitcoin developer Justus Ranvier late 2015 , designed solve problem . They use another Bitcoin innovation designed Bitcoin Core developer Dr. Pieter Wuille : The Hierarchical Deterministic ( HD ) key creation transfer protocol . In short , protocol allows creation series seemingly independent Bitcoin private keys addresses single seed.With Reusable Payment Codes , sender sends so-called “ extended public key ” receiver otherwise normal transaction . With extended public key ( “ stealth ” ) public key published receiver , sender able generate series Bitcoin addresses send bitcoins . The receiver , meanwhile , use extended public key combine ( “ stealth ” ) private key generate corresponding Bitcoin private keys.As , sender send almost unlimited amount transactions receiver , addresses “ linked together ” sender receiver . Onlookers see normal Bitcoin transactions ‒ knowing go receiver ; receiver ’ published anywhere.However , since light wallets ’ monitor blockchain , initial “ notification ” transaction serve “ piggy back ” seed-data recognizable , , outside world . This might reveal transacting addresses linked real-world identities . Even , would reveal transacting ; much subsequent addresses.In new partnership , LexisNexis Risk Solutions , global big-data technology analytics firm , integrated anti-money laundering data Elliptic ’ Bitcoin transaction monitoring compliance products . As result , clients Elliptic ’ blockchain intelligence service obtain meaningful insights automatically screening Bitcoin entities links sanctions , enforcement , politically exposed persons , adverse media state-owned companies , well “ exposing money launderers , human traffickers , terrorists drug dealers use Bitcoin make dark web purchases. ” “ The lack financial transparency Bitcoin entities continues stymie ubiquitous adoption Bitcoin virtual currencies , ” notes joint press release . “ That reality , though , soon short-lived. ” Elliptic , blockchain security compliance company established London 2013 , strives “ global standard blockchain intelligence ” transferring rigorous security compliance standards traditional finance world digital currencies . “ We identify illicit activity Bitcoin blockchain provide actionable intelligence financial institutions law enforcement agencies. ” In July , example , Elliptic Internet Watch Foundation announced partnership monitor report Bitcoin transactions related child pornography.LexisNexis Risk Solutions , part RELX Group , combines cutting-edge technology , data advanced analytics provide information helps customers across industries government predict , assess manage risk . It used one hundred top U.S. banks firm also works eighty percent U.S. federal agencies , assisting regulatory compliance mitigating business risk , identity fraud , money laundering , terrorist financing tax evasion , International Business Times reports. “ This alliance demonstrates data , technology analytics used innovative ways foster financial transparency China Germany U.S. , ” said Thomas C. Brown , senior vice president U.S. Commercial Markets Global Market Development LexisNexis Risk Solutions. “ More banks , Fintech startups , payments companies eCommerce businesses consider usefulness permissionless blockchain today able deploy best-of-breed money laundering screening Bitcoin . As result , virtual currency potential evolves new level — possible conduit money laundering trusted technology along economic value chain. ” Detecting money laundering complicated , course , engage illicit activities put sorts smokescreens place often enough money spend counter-detection measures . For example , according data provided Elliptic , largest dark marketplaces facilitate $ 250 million annual sales. “ For first time , Bitcoin companies leverage bank-grade risk management practices identify Bitcoin entities appear sanction watch lists around world , ” said Dr. James Smith , Elliptic CEO co-founder . “ Having enriched data set built natively Elliptic ’ products takes Bitcoin AML KYC controls next level. ” Smith added leading Bitcoin companies globally using Elliptic products assess risk $ 1 billion Bitcoin transactions month . “ By integrating LexisNexis Risk Solutions ’ robust watchlist data , making safe new wave financial institutions handle Bitcoin bank Bitcoin companies , ” said.Its new partnership LexisNexis created service bring bank-grade anti-money laundering ( AML ) controls Bitcoin transactions , making virtual currency attractive might want use legitimate transactions , Reuters reports.According companies , Bitcoin operators need demonstrate strict compliance AML KYC ( know customer ) want taken seriously financial world large , therefore new monitoring solution help mainstreaming emerging distributed ledger economy . However , ’ expected want escape detection — always illicit reasons — increasingly resort non-Bitcoin alternatives able provide enhanced privacy.In June 2015 Bitcoin Magazine covered launch “ The Bitcoin Big Bang , ” interactive visualization plots emergence interconnectivity key players Bitcoin since genesis 2009 . It described breakthrough Bitcoin transaction monitoring compliance . According company , monitoring compliance services help digital currency businesses gain credibility establish good relations banks mainstream financial operators.Of course , operators Elliptic Chainalysis , Swiss company provides similar services , often criticized parts Bitcoin community , especially libertarian early adopters . However , seems likely monitoring compliance services stay grow.In aftermath recent theft $ 65 million worth bitcoins Bitfinex , parts Bitcoin community wondering role BitGo ’ multisig-focused security offering may played whole ordeal.According company ’ website , BitGo handles 10,000 Bitcoin transactions per day helps users transfer $ 1 billion worth value per month . Many exchanges , Bitstamp Kraken , use BitGo ’ services.Bitcoin Magazine reached Bitstamp Head Business Development Vasja Zupan get exchange ’ thoughts BitGo light recent hack.Sticking BitGoWhen asked whether Bitstamp second thoughts use BitGo ’ multisig architecture , Zupan quick come blockchain security company ’ defense . “ For , Bitstamp see reason second thoughts using BitGo ’ technology , ” said . “ We believe proper implementation , regular audits , overall strong security policies make difference. ” Zupan went point Bitstamp first exchange implement combination cold storage multisig hot wallet . “ We confident system , ” added.Differences Bitfinex SetupWhile traders may concerned Bitstamp using security offering used Bitfinex hack , Zupan attempted ease worries pointing Bitstamp ’ multisig implementation “ fundamentally different Bitfinex. ” “ Bitstamp uses BitGo exclusively hot wallet , small amount bitcoins kept ( 2 percent ) , ” Zupan continued . “ The vast majority bitcoins stored offline cold storage. ” Bitstamp victim hack January 2015 . More $ 5 million worth bitcoin stolen theft . The good news , unlike Bitfinex , vast majority Bitstamp ’ funds held cold storage . Ironically , hack prompted Bitstamp partner BitGo multisig security offering.Zupan also discussed aspects company ’ exchange structured reassure traders system secure. “ Aware monitoring crucial industry , first virtual currency exchange get formal oversight place , ” said . “ A key component recently acquired licence , requires constant external financial audits , code reviews penetration tests , examinations regular reporting financial balances . This provides security users require. ” “ In view , unfortunate incident serves confirm importance compliance , corporate governance , regulatory monitoring auditing virtual currency services , ” Zupan added . “ We , course , hope issue resolved quickly positive outcome Bitfinex customers. ” Reasoning Behind Bitfinex ’ Storage SetupOne main questions asked Bitfinex aftermath hack decided eliminate cold storage aspect storage setup . This question least partially answered Bitfinex ’ Zane Tackett Whalepool Teamspeak server weekend. “ There lot reasons went implementation BitGo ; one , big one , transparency , ” said Tackett . “ Everyone wallet watch blockchain . They see bitcoin time , settle per day. ” Tackett argued since Bitfinex offers high level transparency , unable cover things funds lost stolen . The details exchange secure bitcoins future unknown time.The Sandia National Laboratories , major United States Department Energy research development facility , campuses Albuquerque , New Mexico Livermore , California , managed operated Sandia Corporation ( wholly owned subsidiary Lockheed Martin ) , joining war Bitcoin anonymity.Sandia researchers created set requirements analysis tool used fight use bitcoin criminals . The Department Homeland Security ( DHS ) Science Technology ( S & T ) directorate requested Sandia set graphical user interface front end Sandia research environment DHS agents test algorithms Sandia using actual investigations . The result Sandia ’ work could eventually delivered federal law enforcement agencies.It ’ worth noting Sandia , adopting position becoming widespread among financial operators , institutions administrations , persuaded Bitcoin stay poised disruptive positive impact economy . The problem potential anonymity offered Bitcoin continues exploited criminals escape detection. “ In many ways , figuring effectively combat illicit Bitcoin commerce reduce perception tool criminals encourage people companies adopt Bitcoin legitimate purposes , ” said Sandia researcher , Andrew Cox , leading project. “ Our job understand Bitcoin works , ” added Cox . “ Bitcoin new , semi-anonymous currency holds potential change way sorts transactions work way might really benefit economy . Some potential benefits include making monetary transactions much efficient thereby driving costs business , making transaction histories transparent , could help financial markets financial regulation , depending ask , reducing risks associated inflation reliance centralized monetary institutions . All said , clear criminals pioneers using Bitcoin . They use drugs , guns , child pornography sorts terrible stuff. ” A solution abandoning Bitcoin re-using specific aspects underlying blockchain technologies create non-anonymous digital currencies desired features Bitcoin — cheap transactions permanently recorded tamper-proof ledger . This approach followed “ permissioned blockchains ” current plans central bank issued digital currencies.However , ’ certain permissioned , centrally controlled blockchain could leverage network effect powers Bitcoin . Legendary cryptographer Nick Szabo experts persuaded banks embrace crowd-sourced power resiliency permissionless blockchains like Bitcoin.Another solution de-anonymize bitcoin transactions blockchain network analysis tools developed companies like Elliptic Chainalysis . In fact , bitcoin transactions anonymous . The full transaction history bitcoin address , including every transaction associated address , permanently recorded tamper-proof public blockchain open analysis . The illusion anonymity stems pseudonymous nature bitcoin addresses , explicitly associated owners , although blockchain network analysis often de-anonymize bitcoin users . This Sandia ’ approach.According Cox , “ silver bullet ” algorithm effectively de-anonymize Bitcoin . To would involve cross-referencing anonymous data , traditional sources investigative data identify suspects . “ To successful , reality ’ going take different types algorithms additional types investigative techniques including good old-fashioned police work , ” said Cox . “ They ’ going combined. ” The Sandia team set research testbed experiment algorithms de-anonymize illicit Bitcoin users , including mix traditional novel investigative techniques . Of course , criminals try evade detection using different bitcoin addresses , Sandia research results show known methods often reveal users using different Bitcoin addresses. “ It ’ mean get actual names ’ names associated Bitcoin , ” said Cox . “ But show transactions controlled user. ” Then , one transactions de-anonymized linked criminal , law enforcement able refer back rest associated Bitcoin addresses need deal . “ Our clients happy requirements ’ developed research ’ done types tools capabilities needed , ” concluded Cox.The researchers process generating methods characterizing transactions Bitcoin users applying machine learning methods uncover patterns interest.The dark web started embrace Monero , privacy-conscious alternative Bitcoin.First , operators SIGAINT , commonly used dark web email provider , decided host full node Monero light wallets . Then , eight-month-old darknet market called Oasis decided allow vendors accept Monero . Finally , Alphabay , largest darknet market operation right , announced first phase Monero implementation platform.Why Monero ? Staff members Alphabay Oasis say customers vendors simply demanded Monero option . “ It 's lot secure Bitcoin , especially comes obfuscation , ” said anonymous member Alphabay support staff.Although darknet marketplaces tend get negative press , reality many bend backwards customers ; least ( ) exit scam . “ We received lot requests ; 've studied cryptocurrency , 've decided implement , ” said Oasis staff member . “ This users ( customers vendors ) suggest implement change features . We love hear back everyone. ” The hidden service set operators SIGAINT acts manner similar Electrum familiar particular Bitcoin wallet . The hidden service allows individuals use lightweight Monero clients opposed running full node . When visiting hidden service via Tor Browser , information Monero shown , including following message : '' The SIGAINT operators firmly believe Monero next logical step Darknet commerce . It solves privacy problems plague cryptocurrency systems Bitcoin . `` Bitsquare ShapeShift.io appear two options obtaining Monero via Tor moment.Why Not Dash Zcash ? In addition reasons supporting Monero , SIGAINT operators reasons prefer options , Dash Zcash . In case Dash , site operators wary possible collusion digital currency ’ supernodes . With Zcash , operators concerned company ’ registration United States , fact mixing done opt-in basis possibility secret inflation initiated maintainers system.The site operators also claim CoinJoin enough maintain transaction unlinkability Bitcoin . In Reddit comment , Bitcoin Core contributor Luke-Jr seemed sympathetic viewpoint . “ Only fool would use Bitcoin today darknet , ” stated.The staff members Alphabay Oasis seemed less inclined talk privacy-centric digital currencies . “ Have n't read [ ] yet , ” said Alphabay staff member asked Dash Zcash.One staff member Oasis , runs donations , made clear ’ mainly interested keeping customers happy : “ Users requested Monero implementation ; would n't done anything without request . There tons cryptocurrencies obviously implement . We always based first users ’ feedback. ” What Does This Mean Bitcoin ? Bitcoin ’ main value proposition fungible , bearer ecash censored tracked , ’ unclear whether Monero able chip away leading digital currency ’ nearly $ 10 billion market cap . The price Monero roughly doubled aftermath darknet announcements coming back 0.007 BTC area.Although staff members Alphabay Oasis seem philosophically married Bitcoin comments Bitcoin Magazine , Monero faces many challenges road toward widespread adoption dark web store value . Even Riccardo Spagni , well-known Monero developer , tell people buy Monero . Instead , views place experimentation features currently tested Bitcoin . It ’ possible sort testing take place Bitcoin sidechains near future.Even scenario Monero gains traction dark web , ’ unclear would enough become preferred store value . Bitcoin still much longer track record much liquid market , ’ possible darknet market customers vendors use Monero appcoin anything else , even moving Monero system would harm privacy.The push toward Monero dark web development worth watching , ’ first time darknet market accepted alternative , privacy-conscious digital currency . Two small markets accepted Dash ( called Darkcoin ) late 2014 , altcoin able gain traction dark web . Time tell things go differently Monero.Bitcoin right really anonymous . While Bitcoin addresses n't necessarily linked real-world identities , . Monitoring unencrypted peer-to-peer network , analyses public blockchain Know Your Customer ( KYC ) policy Anti-Money Laundering ( AML ) regulations reveal lot 's using Bitcoin what.This great privacy perspective . For example , Bitcoin users might necessarily want world know spend money , earn much ; similarly , businesses may want leak transaction details competitors.Additionally , fact transaction history bitcoin traceable puts fungibility bitcoins risk . “ Tainted ” bitcoins , example , may valued less bitcoins , possibly even calling question Bitcoin 's value proposition money.There potential solutions may increase privacy improve fungibility Bitcoin . But solutions either partial , works-in-progress largely theoretical.To reclaim privacy right , therefore , bitcoiners begun utilize one competitors : altcoin Monero.The Bitcoin ScenarioPerhaps main reason Bitcoin offer whole lot privacy different transactions easily linked together.This Bitcoin transactions consist inputs outputs . Inputs refer addresses bitcoins sent “ ” outputs refer addresses bitcoins sent “ ” . Naturally , , outputs one transaction become inputs next . The receiver one output sender subsequent input usually person.Moreover , since transactions made one person , input addresses typically belong person well . Meanwhile , one person usually sends bitcoins one person per transaction . That means two different outputs , one must change address , used sender send excess bitcoins back himself.All links chain make individual bitcoins traceable ; ’ possible determine transactions certain bitcoin previously used , thereby potentially harming fungibility decreasing privacy , links allow blockchain analysts figure bitcoins likely belong ( ed ) whom.The Monero ScenarioAs opposed majority altcoins , Monero based Bitcoin ’ code-base protocol . Instead , cryptocurrency , launched 2014 , based CryptoNote reference implementation , altcoin designed scratch.Monero created pseudonymous developer thankful today , effectively “ fired ” community less month Monero ’ launch , project forked away . It since led core team seven developers , including Riccardo “ fluffypony ” Spagni Francisco “ ArticMine ” Cabañas . Its native curreny , XMR , one top altcoins market cap , accepted payment several dark net markets.In Monero , basic structure Bitcoin transactions still holds : consists inputs ( “ ” ) outputs ( “ ” ) . But two key differences . For one , outputs consist rounded decimal numbers . So instead output worth 15.7 XMR , three outputs , worth 10 , 5 0.7 XMR . And change outputs also rounded . So input worth , say , 60 XMR , change outputs worth 40 , 4 0.3 XMR combined output total 60 . Six outputs ( 40 , 10 , 5 , 4 , 0.7 0.3 ) , sender receiver know ones payments change . This already makes blockchain analysis bit harder.But really setup trick.Ring signaturesThe actual magic comes cryptographic signature scheme called “ ring signatures , ” based older concept “ group signatures. ” Ring signatures exist several iterations variations , share property obfuscating cryptographic key signed “ ” message , still proving “ ” cryptographic key signed “ ” message . The version used Monero called “ Traceable Ring Signatures , ” invented Eiichiro Fujisaki Koutarou Suzuki.Taking example , input worth 60 XMR used create six outputs , Monero utilizes ring signatures follows.The sender created 60 XMR input must previously received 60 XMR output earlier transaction . After , create 60 XMR input controls 60 XMR output first.But ring signatures , sender obfuscate “ ” 60 XMR output controlled . Instead , take several 60 XMR outputs different transactions , bundle together way proves owns “ one ” outputs — without revealing “ one ” . And since Monero works round numbers , plenty 60 XMR outputs available blockchain mix with.As result , Monero transactions almost completely unlinkable . At best , blockchain-analysts calculate odds transactions linked , based many outputs used mix create input . ( This configurable sender , minimum three . ) And Back Again ... So help Bitcoin Bitcoin users ? Simple : Monero used “ unlink ” Bitcoin transactions much way Monero transactions unlinked.Specifically , Bitcoin users sell bitcoin XMR , ideally Tor-friendly exchange require AML/KYC , like Shapeshift Bitsquare . Later , simply sell XMR back bitcoin different platform , also done XMR.to . If buys sells spread time bit ( since low transaction volume Monero slight giveaway cases ) , leaves virtually link blockchain all.In ’ turning “ year hack , ” security issues increasingly top mind working Bitcoin blockchain space.Security expert Pamela Morgan CEO Third Key Solutions , attorney Empowered Law PLLC , board member C4 . She partners Third Key Solutions , Andreas M. Antonopoulos ( CTO ) Richard Kagan ( Business Advisor ) , provide advice security solutions wallets , exchanges , crowd sales , new innovative Bitcoin blockchain projects.Bitcoin Blockchain `` More Secure Than Ever Before '' In interview Bitcoin Magazine , Pamela Morgan noted contradiction , despite recent events , Bitcoin blockchain technologies may actually secure ever : “ Bitcoin secure ever keeps getting stronger . The true several blockchains increase security mature broaden reach . But seemingly contradicted frequent hacks affecting many users. ” “ The contradiction lies subtle important difference : Funds controlled directly individuals decentralized manner secured decentralized blockchain protocols extremely secure. ” “ On contrary , single entity concentrates control funds many individuals custodial ( aka hot ) wallet accounts poorly implemented large cold storage wallets , become extremely attractive target — honeypot attackers. ” Security Becomes Important Priority EthereumOne entity , Ethereum DAO , suffered cyber attack June ( losing one-third total funds ) subsequent split Ethereum Ethereum Classic.This tested Ethereum ’ vulnerabilities , among measures , resulted hiring Martin Holst Swende , former NASDAQ information security specialist.Swende work Ethereum Foundation-funded projects enhance security responsible Ethereum ’ overall security ongoing development , working smart contract developers creating special security website. “ Unintended Consequences Such Re-entrancy Bug ” We asked Morgan take unprecedented Ethereum DAO attack . She told us : “ Rapid disruptive innovation inherently risky . You ’ get moon without blowing rockets ’ get secure , large-scale smart contracts without blowing DAOs . The basic mantra business applies — fail fast , fail cheap . The DAO achieved former. ” “ Writing smart contracts control funds securely difficult . Over time , security-critical components mature many iterations many losses . Even though Ethereum platform past beta , every new smart contract component treated pre-alpha software. ” “ Smart contracts need mature Ethereum platform ’ magically make robust . Both platform contracts mature iteration together . The funds controlled smart contracts proportional degree maturity testing. ” “ Too much money invested quickly immature overly complex contract . Complexity enemy security . The flexibility introduced Turing complete , high-level smart contract language brings unintended consequences , reentrancy bug introduced DAO contract. ” Bitfinex : One BooksThe August hack Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange Bitfinex , one top bitcoin traders globally , tune roughly $ 70 million , sent chill digital currency world shook complacency around security bitcoin exchanges.Some experts tied hack shaky bitcoin price wonder take restore confidence ; others believe Bitcoin ’ security affirmed since Bitfinex able avoid shutdown Bitcoin 's blockchain retained security functionality spite hack.In response Bitfinex attack , Stefan Thomas , one original Bitcoin developers Ripple ’ Chief Technology Officer said , “ There ’ history write secure code . It surprising would easy miss typical problems. ” Morgan commented : “ The architecture bitcoin service provider , exchange , holding funds tens thousands users inherently flawed . Re-centralizing data , case bitcoin keys , opposite decentralized architecture Bitcoin itself. ” “ Multisignature technology widely misunderstood security “ fix ” multisig simply tool . Two entities controlling keys funds 100,000 users bit better one entity , good 100,000 points control. ” “ No one knows secure large concentrations data . The data breaches companies like Yahoo , Target , Best Buy even NSA demonstrate point . The issues scale apply bitcoin data . The difference bitcoin theft identity theft bitcoin users feel sting immediately. ” Staying One Step Ahead Hack Formal Verification “ Formal verification ” new buzzword security business . Morgan thinks likely eventually , “ smart contracts incorporate formally verified components build strong foundation , use flexible coding practices rest contracts. ” “ Formal verification interesting methodology rebalances tradeoff flexibility security , ” added . “ Many programmers find difficult write code formally verified ; core services , deciding owns contract controls funds ( authentication , authorization , policy ) formal verification could deliver much secure code. ” “ Decentralized Consensus Innovation Matters. ” A number developers argued security flaw blockchain technology requirement achieve distributed consensus new security measures.Updates software blockchain inhibited majority run software must agree rollout.However , Morgan takes different view : “ We already systems centralized , controllable censored — like Ripple . They novel . They disruptive . They business-as-usual word “ blockchain ” painted thin veneer innovation . Decentralized consensus innovation matters. ” “ Overall , I attribute hacks industry symptoms growing pains fast moving space . Certainly caused sloppiness , bad actors , re-introduction centralization , I believe simple human error face unexplored territory complexity . We simply ’ understand risks ’ one way learn — real money , real risk , real people. ” “ Eventually security functions smart contracts built combining battle-hardened mature modules common functionality — much like cryptographic libraries random number generators , people write . Until , try , test , fail try . As systems iterate mature , become secure , useful , therefore valuable. ” Bitcoin right really anonymous . Monitoring unencrypted peer-to-peer network , analyzing public blockchain Know Your Customer ( KYC ) policies Anti-Money Laundering ( AML ) regulations reveal lot using Bitcoin what.This great privacy perspective . For example , Bitcoin users might necessarily want world know spend money , earn much ; similarly , businesses may want leak transaction details competitors.Additionally , fact transaction history bitcoin traceable puts fungibility bitcoins risk . “ Tainted ” bitcoins may valued less bitcoins , possibly even calling question Bitcoin 's value proposition money.But privacy fungibility improved . An older method break link transactions — CoinSwap — recently revived improved upon , promising results . TumbleBit , new solution called , set realize completely private trustless mixing service — even offers increased scalability bonus.CoinSwapA key problem privacy fungibility Bitcoin-addresses trivially linkable . If Alice pays Bob bitcoin , blockchain analysis reveals addresses transaction.To break link , Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell proposed CoinSwap , first introduced Bitcointalk forum 2013.The idea behind CoinSwap simple : uses intermediary payment . If Alice pays one bitcoin intermediary , intermediary pays different bitcoin Bob , Alice effectively paid one bitcoin Bob , link exists addresses blockchain.The problem intermediary steal funds . If Alice pays intermediary bitcoin , intermediary simply decide pay Bob , instead keep bitcoin.This solved Hash Time-Locked Contracts ( HTLCs ) . Alice intermediary set special type payment channel , Bob intermediary set payment channel well . Through clever Bitcoin tricks include embedding dedicated cryptographic keys transactions , payment channels effectively linked . Bob claim one bitcoin payment channel intermediary , way intermediary also claim bitcoin payment channel Alice . No one steal funds . ( The specifics HTLC beyond scope article ; details see ‘ Understanding Lightning Network , Part 2 : Creating Network ’ . ) CoinSwap breaks link transactions blockchain . But , unfortunately , ’ solve privacy fungibility issues yet . Most importantly , intermediary still knows Alice transacted Bob . The intermediary re-establish link.These issues new TumbleBit improvement solves.TumbleBitTumbleBit proposed Boston University ’ Ethan Heilman , Leen Alshenibr , Foteini Baldimtsi , Alessandra Scafuro Sharon Goldberg last summer , recently presented Scaling Bitcoin workshops Milan.TumbleBit resembles CoinSwap , adds three important features.First , adds anonymity numbers . TumbleBit allows many users — many “ Alices ” many “ Bobs ” — set payment channels intermediary . And Alices send bitcoins Bobs intermediary.Second , payment channels intermediary Bobs replaced sophisticated cryptographic puzzles . If Bob provide solution puzzles , claim — say — bitcoin . The trick Alice buys answers puzzles intermediary bitcoin . She sends answer Bob payment , Bob happily accept since claim bitcoin it.And importantly : done several layers cryptography . This ensures intermediary know solution sold Alice , Alices know puzzle solution gave Bob . As , Bobs claim bitcoins , intermediary sees puzzles solved . But due anonimity numbers , intermediary link Alices Bobs.And third , Alices Bobs fund payment channels intermediary make several payments . And , Alice pay Bob ; ’ need Bob time . This makes intermediary useful payment hub.Furthermore , puzzle-solving transactions Alices , intermediary , Bobs , never hit blockchain . Rather , everyone done transacting , end-state payment channels recorded blockchain , let everyone take funds . TumbleBit scalable second-layer payment hub top privacy-friendly solution.RealityLast least : TumbleBit realized without requiring changes Bitcoin protocol.The team Boston University already coded proof concept run successful tests blockchain . While software quite ready production use yet , open source free anyone use contribute to.Furthermore , TumbleBit really requires single party establish service . In fact , would better one ( ) parties offer : everyone uses TumbleBit service , one service offers great anonymity numbers . ( Since ’ completely trustless , centralization issue . ) And since fees trivially implemented design , moreover , even incentive establish TumbleBit server . It seems ’ matter time someone realizes potential.Bitcoin right really anonymous . Monitoring unencrypted peer-to-peer network analysis public blockchain , combined Know Your Customer ( KYC ) policies Anti-Money Laundering ( AML ) regulation , reveal lot using Bitcoin what.This great privacy perspective . For example , Bitcoin users might necessarily want world know spend money , earn much ; similarly , businesses may want leak transaction details competitors.And fact transaction history bitcoin traceable puts fungibility bitcoins risk . “ Tainted ” bitcoins may valued less bitcoins , possibly even calling question bitcoin 's value proposition money.But improved . Perhaps one promising solutions designed integral part one Bitcoin ’ highly anticipated scaling layers : lightning network . Utilizing “ Sphinx ” protocol , lightning payments routed Tor-like anonymity network offer privacy protect fungibility.Payment Channels Lightning Network : A Brief RecapThe lightning network essentially consists bi-directional payment channels , creating peer-to-peer network.Bi-directional payment channels increase privacy even without lightning network . Two users — let ’ say Alice Bob — open bi-directional payment channel transact channel private medium . Only finished transacting broadcast final state channel blockchain . This public transaction reveals much money Alice sent Bob — way around . But way tell whether ten transactions , hundred small transactions , maybe even thousand transactions back forth . This ambiguity boon privacy.Unfortunately , disadvantage introduced bi-directional payment channels linked create peer-to-peer network . If Alice pays third user — Carol — Bob , Bob know Alice paid Carol , much . While Alice Carol still relative privacy relation rest world , privacy relation Bob . And two intermediaries — Bob also Dan — Bob Dan learn transaction Alice Carol.Not ideal.SphinxThe current lightning network specification includes solution mask routing data intermediaries , based Sphinx.Designed academic researchers , George Danezis Ian Goldberg , Sphinx protocol relay anonymized messages peer-to-peer network . The solution first proposed May 2009 , nothing lightning network even Bitcoin . It Lightning Labs ’ Olaoluwa Osuntokun realized Sphinx could utilized , collaboration Blockstream ’ Christian Decker , modified protocol better fit lightning network.Sphinx shares similarities well-known anonymizing communication tool , Tor ( Onion Router ) . As Tor , data package sent Sphinx — including receiving IP address – encrypted . This encrypted package encrypted couple times consists several “ layers ” encryption ( hence “ onion ” metaphor Tor ) .Using clever cryptographic tricks , layers encryption applied intermediary along route toward final destination package unwrap one layer . This layer reveals intermediary package must forwarded , nothing else . ( Compared Tor , Sphinx uses improved cryptographic algorithms creates constant-size data package better obfuscate node ’ position route . ) On lightning , payer determines path peer-to-peer network wraps payment package layers encryption . And , apart relay information , intermediary also unpacks additional data . This includes amounts , fees , along allowing intermediaries set step payment chain . ( In future version lightning network , may extended protocol called “ Hornet ” streamline whole process — strictly needed lightning network function . ) Importantly , intermediaries learn channel receive bitcoins , channel must forward payment . The intermediaries idea whether first step chain , last step , step somewhere middle , perhaps even step . Whoever originally sent transaction , one ultimately receives , remain known sender receiver.Whenever channels close , advantages offered bi-directional payments channels clear — steroids . While everyone gets see many bitcoins Alice sent Bob duration channel , , remains unknown whether ten transactions , hundred small transactions , maybe even thousand transactions back forth . Moreover , Alice may even sent much money Bob : perhaps payments Alice Bob actually routed Carol , someone else , anywhere network.While Silk Road popularized industry back 2011 , AlphaBay widely used darknet market existence . Usage statistics hard come comes Tor hidden services , interview Deep Dot Web earlier year , site ’ head administrator claimed many vendors now-defunct Evolution marketplace moved AlphaBay.The popularity AlphaBay also obvious darknet markets subreddit , popular forum choice shop darknet.Bitcoin Magazine reached AlphaBay get thoughts Bitcoin scaling two privacy-focused altcoins : Monero Zcash.On Bitcoin CongestionMany Bitcoin-related companies deal increase support tickets due increased congestion network past year , AlphaBay spared headache . “ It become issue [ ] backlog blockchain , many newbie users complain missing deposits fact unconfirmed , ” member AlphaBay support team told Bitcoin Magazine.Although various improvements privacy scalability discussed Scaling Bitcoin workshop Milan past October , AlphaBay currently plans run Tumblebit hub Lightning Network node . “ We proprietary tumbling platform , ” said support representative.It noted code projects still works progress . While upcoming social media app Yours implemented micropayments solution , elegant version Lightning Network possible Segregated Witness activated network . Tumblebit require changes Bitcoin protocol , although would improved Segregated Witness . At least two implementations currently development.Are AlphaBay Users Paying Monero ? After AlphaBay Oasis ( another darknet market ) integrated Monero payments late August , market cap Monero grew around $ 25 million $ 170 million couple weeks . The market cap settled around $ 110 million.While Oasis appears pulled exit scam ( ran away users ’ money ) since Monero announcement , AlphaBay still alive kicking . An AlphaBay support representative told Bitcoin Magazine Monero accounts 2 percent AlphaBay ’ business.According MoneroStats , less 500 transactions per day Monero network darknet markets took interest Bitcoin alternative . Now , usually three times amount . It ’ unclear much transaction growth due real usage much increased number speculators moving coins exchanges.Zcash Worth ConsiderationZcash launched since AlphaBay adopted Monero , many wondering could next altcoin tested darknet markets . The Zcash market cap currently less tenth Monero ’ s.When asked whether AlphaBay adopt Zcash , support representative told Bitcoin Magazine , “ In future might . It looks like good alternative. ” In quest privacy fungibility Bitcoin , two researchers ( Saarland University Saarbrücken , Germany Indiana ’ Purdue University ) presented promising privacy enhancement proposal last week . ValueShuffle , protocol called , describes method mix bitcoins time hide amounts involved mixing process.It ’ potent combination , Tim Ruffing , one researchers , explained : “ The combination two privacy-enhancing technologies , requiring trusted third party , makes ValueShuffle unique. ” CoinJoin CoinShuffleRuffing wrote ValueShuffle draft white paper Pedro Moreno-Sanchez ; two researchers previously proposed CoinShuffle protocols , along PhD advisor , Aniket Kate , Saarland University.Leveraging CoinJoin , first proposed Bitcoin Core Blockstream developer , Gregory Maxwell , CoinShuffle method merge several transactions one , need trusted party . As , single Bitcoin transaction send bitcoins many people many people . This potentially obfuscates trail coins , ’ longer clear exactly paid whom.The obfuscation potential , however , amount coins involved transaction giveaway . If one transaction sends five bitcoins address address , another transaction sends seven bitcoins address address , merging one transaction would obfuscate much . Simply matching amounts reveals sent bitcoins whom. “ With initial CoinShuffle proposals , solved everyone uses amounts , ” Ruffing explained . “ If everyone involved mix sends exactly one bitcoin , sending receiving addresses longer matched . But also quite limiting factor . Any remaining coins must go change address without anonymized , cumbersome , may even break privacy used properly . And technical reasons also means use CoinShuffle make payment directly ; send bitcoins back yourself. ” Confidential TransactionsWith ValueShuffle , problem matching amounts solved hiding amounts involved transaction.This accomplished using another proposal designed increase privacy Bitcoin : Confidential Transactions . Developed Blockstream , Confidential Transactions currently implemented Blockstream ’ Elements Alpha sidechain , active Bitcoin ’ testnet.Using clever cryptography , Confidential Transactions ensures one see many bitcoins involved transaction , many sent address address . Nodes , however , verify total number bitcoins sent matches total number bitcoins received . As , sure bitcoins created thin air.The combination CoinJoin Confidential Transactions long considered powerful solution . As CoinJoin obfuscates addresses sent bitcoins addresses , Confidential Transactions obfuscates amounts , break links . With ValueShuffle , done without requiring trusted party merge different transactions one. “ Plus , allows users make payments directly ValueShuffle , rather send mixed bitcoins first , ” Ruffing said.Segregated WitnessThus far , however , Confidential Transactions building block part Bitcoin protocol. “ But may future , ” Ruffing said . “ It rolled backward compatible soft fork , would even easier Segregated Witness activated first . On top , ValueShuffle could benefit Segregated Witness ways . Since Confidential Transactions relatively expensive compared normal transactions , witness “ discount ” help . And Schnorr signature aggregation deployed Segregated Witness well , would another boon efficiency. ” If Confidential Transactions become part Bitcoin protocol — either Segregated Witness independent soft hard fork — much stands way ValueShuffle . The solution would require additional protocol changes ; would require wallets implement solution . And , ideally , server host mixing protocol. “ Technically , done without central server , ’ practical . And keep mind central server ’ need trusted users ’ private keys privacy , ’ easily replaced something goes wrong. ” Ruffing said . “ As wallets , Mycelium already implemented version CoinShuffle . And ValueShuffle even easier implement , ’ based simpler efficient CoinShuffle++ protocol. ” It appears United States Postal Service determined courier choice drug dealers longer.Judging recent job listing sent information security community , United States Postal Inspection Service ( USPIS ) — law enforcement arm U.S . Postal Service ( USPS ) — wants sniff users darknet markets send packages mail . Applicants job , listed “ Investigative ( Internet ) Analyst ” , expected know way around bitcoin — currency choice darkweb — well tools typically used darknets , like Tor.Although job listing ’ appear published online , according Deep Dot Web USPIS specifically looking applicants able unmask pseudonymous users dark net markets : “ Candidates shall capable performing prioritized assessment data identify critical reliable data order identify bitcoins , locations , accounts , services , travels , email addresses , IP addresses pattern life data effort determine physical attribution Internet identity. ” And , according Motherboard : “ The analyst shall capable use technology solutions actively search , analyze prioritize various market places cyber-criminals identify high value targets USPIS investigators. ” Darknet Going ForwardDarknet markets eBay-like market places operate darknets Tor I2P , commonly operating digital black markets . The vast majority purchases illegal drugs , weapons , stolen credit card details illegal goods traded well . Since pioneering darknet market Silk Road closed 2013 , founder Ross Ulbricht sentenced life prison , buying selling illegal contraband increased.Shipment illegal goods exclusively done mail . In cases , least United Stated , done USPS . As federal agency , USPS bound Fourth Amendment US Constitution . This prevents postal service inspecting packages without warrant , attaining turn requires probable cause . Providing probable cause — presumably — investigative analyst would come in.That said , even , mailing system probably weakest link darknet market operations . Where online communication protected encryption Tor , bitcoin ( monero ) payments mixed tumbled , packages still require physical addresses — intercepted.Indeed , USPIS already regularly provide assistance darknet investigations . Perhaps notably , USPIS said played active role November 2016 's `` Operation Hyperion , ” one extensive police operations focused darknet date , thousands users marketplaces identified.The job listing suggests USPIS ramp similar efforts future.Some popular Bitcoin services internet may leaked sensitive user information , including passwords.Cloudflare popular content delivery network effectively acts sort digital shield , proxy offers millions websites DoS protection services . Some biggest websites internet use Cloudflare , including several well-known Bitcoin companies , like Coinbase , Kraken , LocalBitcoins , Poloniex moreAny data sent websites essentially passes Cloudflare . This includes passwords , well cookies , authentication tokens sensitive information.Last week , exploit known “ Cloudbleed ” — reference Heartbleed security bug — discovered Google Project Zero security researcher Tavis Ormandy . A major flaw Cloudflare ’ infrastructure , caused known “ buffer overflow , ” basically spilled data across internet . Whenever anyone requested data particular website mobile app protected Cloudflare , Cloudflare could randomly send data completely different websites along it. “ We fetched live samples , observed encryption keys , cookies , passwords , chunks POST data even HTTPS requests major Cloudflare-hosted sites users , ” Ormandy wrote blog entry.The vulnerability significant scope well length . It could exploited anytime September 22 February 20 , period greatest impact February 13 18 . And potentially bigger concern , search engines may even cached sensitive data well , meaning ’ publicly available anyone.The good news odds sensitive data falling wrong hands far seems relatively small . “ We also discovered evidence malicious exploits bug reports existence , ” Cloudflare wrote incident report.However , bad news way knowing exactly data may leaked . Users services may impacted , therefore , assume data longer secure change passwords immediately . ( This course also includes passwords non-Cloudflare websites used across multiple sites . ) It seems less likely accounts protected two-factor authentication vulnerable , though may depend specific implementation ; resetting still advisable . Those use API keys reset too.Cloudflare since patched bug , search engines ( like Google ) removing data caches find.TumbleBit , one promising privacy advancements built top Bitcoin , implemented upcoming Breeze Wallet.The Breeze Wallet bitcoin wallet development blockchain startup Stratis , scheduled release one two months . It serve typical bitcoin wallet desktop computers , added tumbling option . Connected TumbleBit tumbler , Breeze Wallet users mix coins without needing trust tumbler coins privacy. “ We integrating TumbleBit ’ trustless secure solution works Bitcoin without forks , ” Stratis Founder CEO Chris Trew told Bitcoin Magazine.StratisStratis U.K.-based startup offers end-to-end solutions development , testing deployment blockchain applications . The company maintain blockchain ( Stratis blockchain ) , includes native token ( Stratis token ) . Additionally , company builds tools existing blockchains , including Bitcoin , Ethereum BitShares . Stratis projects include Bitcoin full node programming language C # , Bitcoin software development kit , indeed , Breeze wallet , hold bitcoins Stratis tokens.TumbleBit first proposed academic researchers Ethan Heilman , Leen AlShenibr , Foteini Baldimtsi , Alessandra Scafuro Sharon Goldberg . Inspired potential , “ Programming The Blockchain C # ” author Stratis team member Nicolas Dorier started working implementation TumbleBit C # . He joined co-author book , Ficsór Ádám , focused Tor integration.Now , help Ádám , Stratis making solution available convenient easy-to-use wallet . It natural match Stratis ’ Dorier ’ implementations TumbleBit share programming language , also Stratis strong focus privacy platform , Trew explained. “ Regulation one main hurdles blockchain [ technology ] Bitcoin adoption among financial services industry , ” said . “ The first step regulatory compliance privacy sensitive financial data . This one reasons rise private chain distributed ledger technologies . Our goal provide open public blockchain solutions enterprise ; deliver must provide transaction privacy public blockchain. ” ChallengesTo realize privacy features promises , Breeze Wallet also introduce relatively new type light client . Based work Bitcoin Core developer Jonas Schnelli , wallet utilize “ Full Block Simplified Payment Verification , ” “ Full Block SPV. ” Full nodes download verify block blockchain , quite resource intensive . Most light clients therefore download specific data ’ relevant : mostly relating Bitcoin addresses . But , need share addresses server node Bitcoin network.This server node — anyone spying communication server node — learns addresses wallet . This makes tumbling coins one address wallet another address wallet rather pointless.Instead , Ádám currently implementing type light client download full blocks immediately discard data ’ need . This requires wallet download data typical light clients , Breeze Wallet ’ suitable mobile wallets anytime soon . But less resource intensive running full node , therefore , easier use regular users.Lastly , one hurdle remains : someone , somewhere , needs host tumbler . While done hidden service , TumbleBit developers hesitant far . Such service may exactly please regulators anti-money laundering agencies.Stratis working legal regulatory issues involved deploying solution type . “ The ultimate goal decentralized network TumbleBit servers . We working delivering end-to-end solutions ; develop core components , ” Trew said.For TumbleBit , read “ With TumbleBit , Bitcoin Mixing May Have Found Its Winning Answer ” “ Better Bitcoin Privacy , Scalability : Developers Making TumbleBit Reality. ” For year , attackers ability crash Bitcoin Unlimited Bitcoin Classic nodes . Yesterday , someone actually . According websites like Coin Dance , number Bitcoin Unlimited nodes fell sharply almost 800 less 250 matter hours . Bitcoin Classic hit shortly after.One day earlier , security researcher found vulnerability reached Bitcoin Magazine. “ I quite beside project aims power $ 20 billion network make beginner ’ mistakes like this. ” The VulnerabilitiesBitcoin Unlimited Bitcoin Classic forks Bitcoin Core intend increase Bitcoin ’ block size limit . Both launched 2015 maintained development teams since . While Bitcoin Classic relatively popular alternative Bitcoin Core last year , Bitcoin Unlimited gaining traction lately . The world ’ largest mining pool — AntPool — announced would switch Bitcoin Unlimited , several smaller pools.But everyone believes good idea. “ I rather dismayed poor level code quality Bitcoin Unlimited I suspect [ ] raft issues , ” security researcher identifying “ Charlotte Gardner ” told Bitcoin Magazine Monday.Communicating email , Gardner said auditing software use , quickly came conclusion ’ highly unsafe : “ What concerns software used huge portion Bitcoin mining ecosystem. ” Gardner revealed submitted two vulnerabilities — “ critical remote crash vulnerabilities ” exact — Bitcoin Unlimited development team.The first one known “ NULL pointer dereference , ” second “ reachable assertion. ” In cases , attackers send especially crafted messages Bitcoin Unlimited Bitcoin Classic nodes make nodes crash . On open peer-to-peer network like Bitcoin ’ , means attacker get list Bitcoin Unlimited Bitcoin Classic nodes publicly available sources , like Bitnodes , simply knock every single one offline. “ I ’ surprised one noticed yet , ” Gardner told Bitcoin Magazine one day attack took place . “ I guess many people actually use Bitcoin Unlimited software . But ‘ rise , ’ attackers may take interest. ” The DisclosureWhen contacting Bitcoin Magazine Monday , Gardner immediately want make vulnerabilities public . That would irresponsible , explained , bugs could still exploited Bitcoin Unlimited development team chance fix it.But also submit vulnerabilities Mitre ’ Common Vulnerabilities Exposures ( CVE ) database . This ensures Mitre discloses bugs one month , pressures developers actually fix problem time.However , even following responsible disclosure , Gardner thought risk vulnerabilities would abused soon fixed Bitcoin Unlimited code repository . After , point problem ’ really solved : anyone running released Bitcoin Unlimited software still vulnerable download run new , revised version . This opens window attackers. “ The problem , bugs glaringly obvious fixing , easy notice anyone watching development process , ” said.It appears exactly happened . While Bitcoin Unlimited developers indeed fix issue shortly pointed , far conspicuous GitHub commit message , Gardner told Bitcoin Magazine appeared bugs seemed fixed attacks began. “ Their commit message ring alarm bells . I ’ sure anyone notice , probably obfuscated message bit . The wording might attract closer scrutiny . But went unnoticed long , maybe go unnoticed. ” Clearly , not.As Gardner warned , ’ take long attackers exploit one vulnerabilities : first attacks happened shortly bugs fixed . A little later , user “ shinobimonkey ” took issue Reddit , Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd tweeted bug social media blew up.Someone even published exploit code anyone use , long Bitcoin Unlimited nodes , followed many Bitcoin Classic nodes. “ This exactly supposed ‘ responsible disclosure ’ protocol , ” Gardner told Bitcoin Magazine attacks took place . “ But ’ help software project discreet fixing critical issues like this. ” Code QualityThis first time code quality Bitcoin Unlimited Bitcoin Classic scrutinized.As best-known example , bitcoin.com mining pool , runs Bitcoin Unlimited , mined invalid block caused bug last January . All energy invested produce block wasted , mining pools spy mined top invalid block wasted energy well.Before , Bitcoin Core developers already warned buggy code several occasions . On Bitcoin-development mailing list , Matt Corallo said found Bitcoin Classic ’ flexible transactions codebase “ riddled blatant massive security holes. ” On Reddit , Gregory Maxwell pointed Bitcoin Unlimited nodes crashing development team removed code ’ removed.Addressing Bitcoin Unlimited lead developer Andrew Stone response yesterday ’ events , Maxwell suggested problems Bitcoin Unlimited ’ codebase yet abused : “ There vulnerabilities Unlimited privately reported Unlimited Bitcoin Core folks acted , sadly . More severe one , fact. ” Perhaps main problem Bitcoin Unlimited , pointed information security expert Andreas Antonopoulos , lacks significant development community perform proper quality analysis . The number developers working Bitcoin Unlimited Bitcoin Classic relatively small , code included exploited vulnerability merged reviewed one person — lot security-critical code protecting people ’ money.Gardner agreed assessment : “ In case , vulnerabilities glaringly obvious , clear one audited code stick like sore thumb , ” said . “ I ’ astounded mining industry running software . But since , lot people could get harmed , best I , recommending ’ use Bitcoin Unlimited , disclose issues hope competent enough fix it. ” Bitcoin Magazine reached Bitcoin Unlimited developers Andrew Stone Andrea Suisani , received response time publication.There chance Bitcoin experience coin-split soon . If majority miners ( hash power ) switch Bitcoin Unlimited decide mine blocks bigger one megabyte , least users stick current Bitcoin protocol , network blockchain split two . In case , may two different types Bitcoin tokens : “ BTC , ” follows current Bitcoin protocol , “ BTU , ” follows new Bitcoin Unlimited protocol.The good news bitcoin would effectively copied onto Bitcoin Unlimited chain . If hold bitcoin right , hold BTC BTU split.The bad news coin-split messy risky . This mainly , first , BTCs BTUs stuck together . You need separate somehow ; otherwise lose BTC BTU.This guide provide basics stay safe coin-split , make sure make “ side ” BTC BTU intact.Author ’ note : If want play BTC/BTU markets soon possible fine taking risks , and/or really know , article probably . ( Perhaps try Electrum article instead . ) If mostly want make sure lose BTC BTU , read …Before Coin-Split ( That ’ Now ) First , aware coin-split high-risk situation . There real chance sort cyber-battle break two camps , perhaps even escalating point bitcoin ’ exchange rate ( ) drops sharply , possibly zero . Make absolutely sure holding value bitcoin willing lose.If decide hold bitcoins , single important piece advice : control private keys.If storing bitcoins exchange , custodial wallet like Coinbase , Circle Xapo , service holds private keys , may may eventually receive coins ends chain . Several exchanges far suggested may made guarantees . And least one exchange , GDAX , explicitly indicated may not.Learn bitcoin wallets . If ’ using kinds services store bitcoins , need create wallet . Send bitcoins new wallet ; wallet holds private keys.What kind wallet want use . That said , basic solutions : If ’ care transacting either BTC BTU anytime soon , really want keep long-term investment , printing private keys paper wallet one option . This option , however , really secure follow strict security precautions , find here.Another option get hardware wallet . Any hardware wallets listed bitcoin.org keep private keys secure . One hardware wallet provider particular , Trezor , explicitly acknowledged users access coins ends chain coin-split happens..Therefore , terms security coins , little changed — action required & coins remain safe . You magically lose coins fork. ” Trezor blog post , March 20 ] Regular wallets secure computer ( phone ) . Since computers phones secure , ideal large amounts . With mind , mobile wallets desktop wallets listed bitcoin.org store private keys . Additionally , full node like Bitcoin Core Bitcoin Knots gives little extra security coin-split , ’ see below.During Coin-SplitThe first thing note Bitcoin Unlimited set `` flag date '' fork . This means theoretically , fork could happen time . Realistically , however , depend miner coordination , probably obvious even casual Bitcoin observers fork close happening.If Bitcoin Unlimited fork , things could get messy anywhere couple hours couple days , longer.Unfortunately , Bitcoin Unlimited currently include “ replay protection. ” This means post-fork , transactions sides fork look identical . If transaction picked networks — example , receiver transaction re-transmits transaction network — transaction may valid chains . This called “ replay attack. ” As , spending coins one end chain could make accidentally spend equivalent coin side chain . Instead paying someone BTC , may unintentionally send BTU well — vice versa . This BTCs BTUs “ stuck together. ” The best way prevent replay attacks simple : send transactions . Not clearer everyone post-fork situation looks like.If use Bitcoin Core Bitcoin Knots wallet want accept BTC , still fine . ( Someone ’ read article may accidentally send equivalent BTU , though . If happens , probably return funds later . ) Bitcoin Unlimited , hand , include “ wipeout protection. ” If amount mining power BTC chain ever overtakes BTU chain , entire BTU chain discarded ( unless users BTU chain coordinate fast enough prevent unconventional ways ) .Unless absolutely clear Bitcoin Unlimited emerges definitive winner forever , accepting BTU risky , probably ’ . After Coin-SplitIf chains survive , control private keys , coins sides fork . But mentioned , tricky spend coins one chain without accidentally spending equivalent side.Fortunately , ways avoid replay attacks . The straightforward solution requires brand-new coins , mined split . These new coins coins exist chains , therefore , spent . Combining new coins old coins effectively splits BTC BTU.This coin-splitting , probably , bit complex . But exchanges likely set coin-splitting services take care complexity behind screens . You ’ need send bitcoins exchange , exchange credit account BTC BTU . ( They even replay transaction , make sure indeed receive coins split . ) If want , also sell BTU BTC ( fiat currency ) , way round.There may also solutions split coins event coin-split , perhaps even trustless solutions . But remains seen.After split , probably wallets coins soon enough . Of course , may need upgrade existing wallet download new wallet happens . This also remains seen . ( Do accept transactions wallet clear . ) Further specifics coin-split announced Bitcoin Magazine ( likely bitcoin.org sources information ) coin-split occurs better understanding post-fork situation.Oh , , years , want use funds stored paper wallet , ’ forget BTC BTU ! ( Wallets like Electrum Blockchain allow upload private keys , ’ probably need go splitting ceremony . ) If one chain survives , operations continue point . However , ’ exactly clear post-fork landscape look like . Perhaps ’ upgrade wallet . This also announced Bitcoin Magazine comes it.If neither chain survives , Bitcoin experiment failed , private keys probably worthless.On typical blockchain , participants check transactions . This level transparency offer much security , public verification ensures single participant cheat others . But great privacy.For bitcoin ( currency ) , potential solution improve privacy “ Confidential Transactions. ” Confidential Transactions hide amounts bitcoin transacted ; currently used test environments academia.Today , Blockstream — well-known tech company founded several Bitcoin Core developers — unveiled “ Confidential Assets. ” Where Confidential Transactions specifically designed bitcoin , Confidential Assets brings similar level privacy type blockchain asset , like ownership papers , stock fiat currency IOUs. “ With Confidential Assets , generate multi-asset transactions amount asset type encrypted , ” Blockstream Infrastructure Tech Engineer Gregory Sanders told Bitcoin Magazine.Confidential AssetsConfidential Assets — entirely new concept — increases privacy two ways.The first part puzzle indeed based Confidential Transactions , first proposed hashcash inventor current Blockstream CEO Dr. Adam Back . This developed Bitcoin Core Blockstream developers Gregory Maxwell Dr. Pieter Wuille , Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra , deployed Blockstream ’ Alpha sidechain.With Confidential Transactions , sender receiver transaction know amount involved specific transaction . A public verifier — ’ rest world — knows transaction made sender receiver , tell much transacted : amount masked.What ’ clever Confidential Transactions amounts masked way public verifiers still perform certain types math . More specifically , anyone add amounts sending end transaction , add amounts receiving end , see cancel . If cancel , means value created thin air . While public verifiers never know much transacted , know system ’ cheated ; ’ really care about.The second part puzzle , new , extends similar type masking assets . Instead bitcoins , Confidential Assets used digital , blockchain-based asset. “ While sender receiver would know , say , gold certificate transacted , public verifier would know ‘ asset ’ transacted — ‘ amount , ’ ” Sanders explained. “ And multiple assets transacted , public verifier would see multiple types ‘ assets ’ changed hands , verify ‘ assets ’ created thin air . But would still know transacted exactly , much ‘ asset. ’ ” ProjectsConfidential Assets may deployed two different projects relatively quickly.For one , combined Blockstream ’ existing sidechain , Liquid . This federated blockchain pegged Bitcoin , instead miners , Bitcoin exchanges service providers confirm blocks . Compared proof work mining , allows instant transactions low cost , without burdening Bitcoin ’ main blockchain . Exchanges , particular , use let customers move bitcoins accounts different exchanges without wait blockchain confirmations.With Confidential Assets , functionality extended fiat side equation , . Rather bitcoins , exchanges service providers could swap fiat currency instantly privately , allowing users move U.S. dollars , euros currencies accounts well.And second , Blockstream established collaboration Japanese IT company Digital Garage. “ Digital Garage working loyalty points blockchain , ” Sanders explained . “ This means types companies issue loyalty points , customers use trade atomically assets using market makers . [ … ] Privacy huge want showing whole world many points outstanding books. ” Moreover , Confidential Assets sidechain could realize trustless , instant private decentralized exchange.As simplified example , Alice bitcoin prefers gold certificate , Bob gold certificate prefers bitcoin , create single CoinJoin transaction realize trade . Alice sends bitcoin Bob , Bob sends gold certificate Alice ; sign end transaction agree.This basic setup extended intermediaries act , , sort liquidity providers peer-to-peer exchanges. “ For Digital Garage demo implemented trustless , blinded swap multiple assets peers already . If deploy fiat currency blockchain , make similar arrangements bitcoin U.S. dollar , euro yen , ” Sanders said.Global consultancy accounting firm Deloitte announced developed new KYC-as-a-service solution using blockchain technology facilitate customer onboarding process financial institutions.The proof concept developed team headed Director Blockchain Leader Thibault Chollet Deloitte ’ Luxembourg branch . The name new solution KYCstart ( pronounced “ kickstart ” ) . KYCstart creates digital identities new customers used across different platforms institutions , thereby making customer onboarding process much efficient also reducing costs.Currently , new customer onboarded financial institution , process involves employee compliance department electronically filling KYC ( Know Your Customer ) forms , include information place incorporation , ownership structure , whether regulated , whether legal proceedings , type business conducted them.To gather information , compliance officers regularly need reach potential customer via email phone well scroll regulator ’ database find recorded wrongdoings confirm regulatory status customer.Deloitte ’ new proposed model completing onboarding process , however , involves regulated KYC added-value service providers , authorized perform KYC checks customers would like onboarded financial institutions , banks , insurance companies investment management firms . Customers clients could control company information shared would able keep track authorizations using blockchain-based smart contracts. “ With proof concept related ecosystem , demonstrate benefits using blockchain [ technology ] smart contract [ ] considerably reduce costs one important burdens institutional clients : KYC customer onboarding , ” Chollet explained.Blockchain Technology Is Making Waves RegTechRegTech ( regulatory technology ) , relatively new branch financial technology , focuses leveraging innovative new technologies improve regulatory reporting monitoring well compliance processes financial institutions.The financial industry particularly keen subsector fintech financial regulations tightened substantially since 2008 global financial crisis , led banks invest heavily areas KYC/AML , compliance risk management . Hence , solution help banks streamline processes reduce overheads welcome financial situations.As Bitcoin Magazine reported April , blockchain technology making waves RegTech . The integration distributed ledger technology compliance systems processes could save financial institutions 50 percent compliance costs , according blockchain startup Coinfirm management consulting firm Accenture.Using blockchain technology , data security could improved , manual processes could digitized , customer onboarding documents could verified authenticity , speed accuracy daily regulatory reporting regulators could increased , digital identities could created companies , shared among permissioned financial institutions , Deloitte ’ new KYC-as-a-service product aiming do.Deloitte plans roll new KYC-as-a-service solution financial institutions summer , newly developed KYCstart one proposed onboarding channels service.Can identity trust integrated blockchain technology ? The answer question appears yes , according recently completed proof-of-concept study conducted Peer Ledger , Canadian blockchain company ; SAFE-BioPharma Association , organization managing global SAFE-BioPharma digital identity management standard ; Synchronoss , leading provider standards-based digital identities.This development believed significant implications use distributed electronic ledgers ( i.e. , blockchains ) medical , pharmaceutical health system applications.The purpose study demonstrate cyber identities comply SAFE-BioPharma standard may , via Peer Ledger APIs , enable blockchain identities de-anonymized , thereby fulfilling requirement double-blind clinical trials , audits responsible supply chains . Prior study , identities associated distributed electronic ledgers entirely anonymous. “ Identity trust ” means trust cyber identity , using process proves individual ’ identity linking cyber credential . In general terms , means credential trusted represent vetted identity individual one business never met face-to-face . This critically important pharma/life sciences space several factors , including deterrence hackers seeking valuable patient records intellectual property , well compliance regulations protecting patient data.These discoveries underscore power blockchain technology disrupt traditional practices drug discovery , patient engagement monitoring , payments participatory healthcare delivery . Here , technology leverages quality shared , synchronized , distributed ledger transactions , fostering security decreasing fraud providing permanent record accessed ledgers activities engaged . The proof concept demonstrated SAFE-BioPharma-compliant digital identities tied back blockchain assure trust identity person engaged transaction . Transactions anonymous end clinical study “ chained back ” proven identity user , needed , regulatory clinical purposes . Alternatively , identities associated block known throughout process , track-and-trace applications medical supply chain.Blockchain technology ’ use group-consensus algorithm used catch intentional inadvertent double spending asset . For example , accounts-receivable blockchain application provide “ multiple eyes ” prevent double invoicing . Similarly , counterfeit-catching purchasing blockchain application prevent harmful substances devices entering medical system.Ultimately , blockchain technology reach full potential sector , myriad systems must interoperable . Currently , healthcare technologies rarely work highly synchronized way one another , pharmaceutical medical companies already powerful identity management tools trialing number different blockchain-based applications.Thus far , apps unable bridge systems pharma companies use establish identity credentials personnel . This problem addressed proof concept . Peer Ledger therefore developed software maps trusted identity , Synchronoss-implemented Verizon Universal Identity Services system blockchain credentials. “ Every SAFE-BioPharma-compliant identity credential accurately represents proven identity person using , ” explains Mollie Shields-Uehling , president CEO SAFE-BioPharma Association . “ Teaming credentials anonymous blockchain ledger postings enables use cases critical overall cybersecurity across healthcare life sciences. ” When asked future applications healthcare , Shields-Uehling Dawn Jutla , CEO founder Peer Ledger , highlighted three major areas blockchain intersection.Blockchain clinical trials : In order co-partner discovery cures , patients may give pharmaceutical companies direct access digitized healthcare records , thus improving data used research speed patient treatment . Britain ’ Chief Scientific Officer , Sir Mark Walport , argued National Health Service , provides healthcare 65 million people , use blockchain technology improve tasks sharing health records.Blockchain data collection : Earlier year , IBM Watson Health announced would work FDA develop secure , efficient scalable exchange health data using blockchain technology . Oncology data initial focus.Blockchain personalized precision medicine : Blockchain technology ’ cryptography secure economical home healthcare sensor feeds . Trusted identity important ensure right test results associated right patient.Netki , New York–based software startup , wants make blockchain technology user friendly launching new universal Netki Digital ID service , anyone access services blockchains without re-validating ID every stop . The Netki Digital ID KYC ( Know Your Customer ) AML ( Anti-Money Laundering ) verified , allowing users access variety blockchain businesses including financial institutions like banks , exchanges healthcare services.Netki wants ID work blockchain , public private , around world provide automated onboarding validation new customers , well easy sharing digital identities.The company ’ goal create digital identity certificate uses standard recognized governments everywhere legally validated , process transactions anywhere world . Pricing based number certificates complexity validations.The Digital ID uses new peer-to-peer payment protocol ( BIP 75 ) allows senders , receivers financial partners exchange four identities via private encrypted channel.According Netki ’ announcement , Netki Digital ID service allow easy capture individual ’ documents biometrics via smartphone , along multiple levels automated manual verification , including database checks , machine learning biometric analysis.International Compliance : A “ Herculean Task ” Netki IDs already use U.S. Europe Bitcoin Ethereum blockchains , company hoping expand service new jurisdictions around world new blockchain networks.Netki ’ CEO Co-Founder Justin Newton talked Bitcoin Magazine process expanding ID service , despite challenge many different legal requirements international regulatory environment.The regulatory landscape changing around world rapid pace . With mind designed tools protocols flexible case differing , new expanding regulatory requirements. “ As work new use case , work customer ’ risk compliance team determine requirements appropriate needs. ” Newton told us team spends time new jurisdiction consulting local regulators offering service.Amber D. Scott , whose company Outlier Solutions works blockchain startups compliance security issues , admires spirit sheer scope Netki ’ undertaking recognizes herculean task ID compliant every jurisdiction.She recommends companies planning implement new identification solutions thoroughly research requirements jurisdictions operating , ensure “ solution meets requirements entirety. ” Scott added , “ We spend lot time clients conducting type testing , solutions pass tests. ” Michael Perklin , internationally recognized security expert oversees security ShapeShift , acknowledges verifying users time-consuming expensive , agrees something like universal ID would make process easier. “ Many people complain 20+ different identity standards seems Netki proposing 21st . It seems like great idea theory success would depend community adopting Netki ID industry standard opposed another service like uPort. ” UPort offers mobile app allows users create self-sovereign credentials would allow process transactions blockchains.Newton told us uPort focusing business model , Netki open-sourced protocol . Another important difference two companies uPort stores private information blockchain Netki stores information off-chain . That said , Netki currently partnering uPort several projects.Caribbean Service Bitt Is Test CaseNetki chose Caribbean region test new service , partnering fintech company Bitt , provides mobile wallet payment services anywhere world.Newton told us : “ In terms project working Bitt , believe one greatest promises blockchain [ technology ] around financial inclusion . The Caribbean region far greater mobile phone penetration banking penetration , banking effectively controlled overseas , ” said.By creating locally run focused alternative , lower cost remittance , spur inter-island trade service many people currently excluded banking online finance.Empowering Individuals Over InstitutionsNetki ’ founders believe blockchain technology game-changer take society next level , allowing democratization levelling existing silos.Newton believes blockchain technology means empowering individuals changing way society interacts ; however , without easy access majority people , universal adoption remain dream.As part simplifying making blockchain technology user friendly , Netki already offers wallet-naming service $ 9.99 per year , allows users register unwieldy wallet address letters numbers simple name , making easier transactions users businesses.Newton excited future possibilities blockchain technology decentralization democratization , saying : “ For first time , using standards implemented Bitt , broadly BIP 75 , regulated entities banks operate public networks like Bitcoin Ethereum still meeting risk compliance requirements . With recent institutional interest , positive government movement around digital currency , tools ’ come better time enable ecosystem really step next level terms usage opportunity. ” Netki partnering IBM Hyperledger Project PwC Australia Vulcan Project.Investors Netki include O'Reilly , AlphaTech Ventures , Colle Capital , Digital Currency Group , Plug Play , Husseine Group , Bitfinex Base Ventures.In January 2016 , Vinny Lingham announced stepped CEO popular mobile gift card service Gyft , speculation began bubble innovation sandbox would stepping next . A vocal advocate Bitcoin blockchain movement media industry events , leading pioneer effort integrate bitcoin payments Gyft tenure . As CEO Civic , new startup company focused digital identity , Lingham pursuit new entrepreneurial quest . Civic ’ mission deliver secure , low-cost identity verification ’ decentralized via blockchain technology . Consumers ability share information social security identity numbers securely device digital signatures validate information ’ tampered with.On May 23 , Lingham Civic CTO Jonathan Smith formally announced launch services Consensus 2017 , offering viable solution ID theft , fake online profiles bank accounts , data breaches adverse impact consumer identity . Civic also unveiled plans Token Summit token offering Ethereum platform . A final token issued RSK platform.Civic tokens provide access product allowing token holders benefit network effect . Overall , Civic endeavors raise $ 33 million token sale , additional tokens beyond allocated enterprise partners developers . The company already received $ 2.75 million funding via Social Leverage , early-stage seed investment fund , well various VC firms engaged Bitcoin blockchain technology , including Pantera Capital , Blockchain Capital Digital Currency Group.Civic ’ stealth digital identity platform designed replace passwords , usernames need biometrics . The company ’ main value proposition targets explosion data breaches hit consumers businesses engage . Civic deliver applications securing cryptocurrencies , e-signatures , social accounts , financial services , e-commerce/credit cards medical records . Moreover , capacity used digital replacement passports , driver ’ licenses voter ID , among utilities.Consumers install app smart device , someone attempts access SSNs within personal ecosystems , get notified . This serves preventive measure unauthorized use personal information . Ultimately goal deliver solutions consumers better control personal information providing positive customer service experience.Speaking Bitcoin Magazine , Lingham noted ID theft pervasive issue , especially recent spate around 2,000 data breaches per year U.S. alone.Civic wants solve problem granting people control identity personal information stored . By verifying information storing personal devices , consumers ensure identity information distributed authorized parties . He emphasized consumer business uses Civic login service , usernames passwords created , thereby reducing vulnerabilities associated around one hack able access accounts.Lingham believes blockchains likely secure place store information right , Civic constantly assessing opportunities leverage capitalize emerging technology.Regarding often-knotty scenarios created around securing government acceptance collaboration , Lingham said : “ We believe technology unique highly differentiated . That said , continue build user base network acceptance , draw governments . We already interest area believe matter time. ” Based Palo Alto , California , Lingham says plans open office native South Africa goal hiring developers . He decided take ambitious step following reforms South Africa ’ business regulations created favorable environment investments. “ We ’ always believed one best applications cryptocurrencies ability power something like voting , one day , ” said Lingham . “ In order get , larger distributed mobile identity problem needed solved first . This focusing — build world ’ largest identity platform , powered technology decentralizes secures consumer identity information. ” Gun violence continues hot topic . Gang violence neighborhoods , terrorist attacks cities , accidental gun discharge among kids , mass attacks schools businesses — forms gun activities leading calls reform throughout world.Through use smart technology , startup Blocksafe seeks deliver blockchain-centric solution gun ownership safe use . Its core premise predicated key issue tied firearms , namely danger pose migrate hands non-owners.With support Blocksafe Foundation , organization evangelizing smart-gun technology gun-ownership freedoms , innovative device decentralized network advancing development . Its mission create safer world weapons tracking accountability , preventing guns falling wrong hands utilized unauthorized gun users.Citizens , law enforcement agencies armed security firms 24/7 real-time access secure anonymous Blocksafe network , thereby allowing ability self-monitor supported firearms devices . Owners receive notifications shots fired unauthorized user guns . Moreover , ability locate disable stolen weapon , Blocksafe app web portal.It noted , however , Blocksafe identify actual shooter utilizing firearm . Rather ’ tracking mechanism individual owners well gun store owners , giving peace mind firearms times.By way example , adult work might remember gun possibly accessible kids home . Blocksafe help track gun actually even remotely disable . Again , goal offer semblance control owner event firearm ends hands unauthorized user , often results gun tragedy.Another illustrative use case : A gun owner whose house robbed away remotely disable stolen firearm , rendering unable resold used later crime.Pulling Trigger InnovationKevin Barnes , founder chairman Blocksafe , honorably discharged U.S. Army veteran , blockchain developer passionate advocate gun ownership . He also tech coder 20 years.Raised among liberty-minded gun lovers , taught embrace U.S. constitutional right bear arms first foremost . As listened read politicians pushing smart-gun efforts media , feared loss life liberty due risks inherited centralized smart-gun infrastructure . These concerns led launch Blocksafe.In interview Bitcoin Magazine , Barnes discusses evolution Blocksafe greatest hopes around future gun safety worldwide . Can describe moment Blocksafe idea first struck ? Being avid gun lover , I range teaching wife shoot various firearms began thinking overpowered thug armed . At moment concept “ Blocksafe ” born . In layman 's terms , Blocksafe ? I tend think Blocksafe light version particle.io enhanced firearm technology . It full-stack IoT device network gives innovators need enable users securely manage devices data . Blocksafe also facilitate innovator ’ use case IoT development , expediting roadmap market security anonymity user sensor data major area focus.Blocksafe enables innovators develop myriad solutions solve problems associated firearms — malware ransomware risks — possible without compromise.How benefit gun industry ? Decentralized applications ( DApps ) developed way greatly benefits companies gun industry . For example , third-party device created manufacturer . They could install custom-built DApp onto , manufacturer easily track inventory distribution.What economics solution ? Economically , revenue generated upsale enhanced add-on devices firearms . With cost IoT infrastructure greatly reduced , innovators focus improving product meet market demands , especially newer generation always connected . Innovators also better meet government commercial needs enhancing devices.What sorts use cases bantered ? Here might align Blocksafe model.Litigation : enhancing authenticity camera video allowed court proceedings.Product Theft : gunstore recoup firearms stolen.Insurance : armoured trucks security companies general better monitor manage firearm usage employees.Training : Instructors use analytics study shooting skills better train students , thereby reducing likelihood accidents.What Blocksafe trigger tokens work ? Triggers appropriately named “ tokens ” power every event smart devices Blocksafe network . The token Counterparty asset ( may become ERC223 later ) introduced demonstrations CoinAgenda Las Vegas later year.What else currently introducing ? Soon demonstrating TrackingPoint M400 smart-gun network .

Ultimately , I see , ’ promoting safer peaceful world full liberty.Monitor blockchains , deanonymize wallet addresses , surveil dark net markets , stop terrorists money launderers : ’ main thrust European Union ’ Project TITANIUM.TITANIUM , stands Tools Investigation Transactions Underground Markets , three-year , €5 million ( $ 5.5 million ) project unite universities , private research firms law enforcement agencies U.K. , Germany , Spain , Austria , Netherlands Finland.Project TITANIUM develop tools best practices criminal investigations involving cryptocurrency Europe , , , law enforcement agencies pursued ad-hoc basis.The project plans create forensic tools spot clusters addresses controlled entity ; identify mixers tumbler addresses used money laundering ; crawl webs , clear dark ; automate information gathering illegal activities.The project ’ coordinator , Dr. Ross King Austrian Institute Technology , said criminal terrorist uses cryptocurrencies dark net markets “ evolve quickly. ” King also insisted Project TITANIUM would respect “ citizen privacy. ” Project TITANIUM ’ announcement comes weeks ransomware worm WannaCry disabled hundreds thousands computers 150 countries . As June 15 , 2017 , hardcoded wallet addresses used attackers collected 50 BTC ransom payments.The project ’ scope covers terrorism , well crime , back-to-back attacks Manchester London ignited calls sweeping government action combat extremism.On June 4 , 2017 , Prime Minister Theresa May called “ international agreements regulate cyberspace ” deny violent extremists “ safe spaces ” online . With terrorism background , cooperation internal security matters like Project TITANIUM likely continue even U.K. formally exits EU.The call surveillance comes despite fact United Kingdom already one wide-ranging surveillance laws , Investigatory Powers Act , went force December 30 , 2016.Nicknamed Snooper ’ Charter , act requires ISPs keep record websites users visit one year allows police public agencies check anyone ’ history without warrant.Meanwhile , EU mulling direct approach problem cryptocurrency . According proposed directive released March 9 , 2017 , EU could require exchanges wallet providers submit account owners ’ identities central database.The directive goes “ virtual currencies anonymous , ” anonymity pseudo-anonymity cryptocurrencies “ hindrance asset ” legitimate users.The rules would apply bitcoin , “ virtual currencies , ” would effectively ban anonymous cryptocurrency , least EU . The proposed directive intended combat money laundering terrorism , despite scant evidence cryptocurrencies play prominent role either.Nevertheless , without evidence empowering terrorists , anonymous pseudo-anonymous nature cryptocurrencies threatening European lawmakers , whether legislation projects like TITANIUM , intend decloak cryptocurrency.TumbleBit one promising privacy-enhancing technologies built top Bitcoin right . It allows users mix coins fully anonymously , without requiring trust third party . An advanced version technology , requires Segregated Witness , even utilized second-layer payment hub reduce transaction costs speed confirmation times.After TumbleBit first proposed academic paper subsequently presented Scaling Bitcoin workshops Milan , NBitcoin lead developer Nicolas Dorier built early version technology . Since , two wallets developed make TumbleBit accessible everyday use : Breeze , recently , HiddenWallet.HiddenWallet developer Ádám Ficsór , better known online “ nopara73 , ” also completed Tor integration week.I estimate TumbleBit usable general public within month two . —Ádám FicsórTor IntegrationTumbleBit lets users connect central server , turn allows establish payment channels send coins back forth way everyone receives many coins sent . Multiple users engage time , allows mix coins , breaking trail ownership Bitcoin ’ blockchain.The key innovation compared previous mixing models TumbleBit uses combination nifty cryptographic tricks make sure , first , one steal funds . And second , one — even central server — link sending addresses receiving addresses.Well , almost . One problem remained , Ficsór explained : “ Users connect central server IP address provide sending receiving addresses , ” said . “ But means central server could still match sending receiving addresses based IP address provided . If one IP address provides Bitcoin addresses , ’ trivial link them. ” This would course defeat purpose using TumbleBit first place.Ficsór therefore built Tor-integration tool existing TumbleBit project . With tool , sending receiving addresses user separately provided central server anonymity network . This removes link user ’ IP address specific Bitcoin addresses — importantly — removes link sending receiving addresses well.Wallet PrivacyAt time , Ficsór developing new wallet specifically designed TumbleBit , HiddenWallet . And interestingly , wallet would even offer increased privacy without TumbleBit.Essentially lightweight wallets leak address data outside world way another . Most web wallets , mobile wallets desktop wallets leak info rely server tells balances . This server therefore needs know addresses wallet link together accordingly.Alternatively , SPV clients send type cryptographic “ puzzle ” ( Bloom filters ) network requests data relevant balance . But leaks address data random nodes network … thus analytics companies specifically monitor network puzzles. “ Blockstream ’ Jonas Nick claimed 2014 someone give one Bitcoin address , ’ able figure 70 percent wallet holdings . This one smart guy limited resources , three years ago . You imagine well-funded analytics companies 2017 capable , ” Ficsór noted.This linking addresses obviously problem TumbleBit users . No matter much users mix bitcoins across Bitcoin addresses , addresses linked together anyway , ’ point.The wallets avoid problem , far , full-node wallets like Bitcoin Core . These wallets download transaction data network , meaning ’ need request specific data reveals addresses . However , full nodes bit resource-intensive , barrier entry many casual Bitcoin users.HiddenWalletHiddenWallet introduces clever model lightweight full-node wallets , specifically designed improve privacy.Like full node , HiddenWallet connects directly Bitcoin network , likewise requests transaction data random nodes . However , full nodes verify ( typically store ) data , HiddenWallet instead immediately discards data ’ need . It verifies stores transaction data involve Bitcoin addresses wallet ’ care rest . This requires far fewer resources full node does. “ The privacy benefit obvious , ” said Ficsór . “ Since HiddenWallet downloads transaction data , connected nodes idea data kept wallet discarded . They learn nothing addresses HiddenWallet ’ link together. ” And Ficsór thinks may able trim resource usage even next release HiddenWallet . This upcoming version may cut transaction data would , analytics companies , obviously relevant wallet anyway . This includes old transaction data , also specific types transactions . Such modification could potentially make HiddenWallet available even low-bandwidth mobile connections.With progress , looks like TumbleBit may usable even end summer , Ficsór estimates. “ We previously thought might get system running around time , turned little bit thought . That said , another big hurdle taken : Japanese company United Bitcoiners running tumbling server . Combined Tor integration wallets , pieces puzzle coming together. ” It comes territory digital currency susceptible digital threats . Hacking theft almost grown side side things like Bitcoin , , popularity value digital currency rises , attraction thieves also grows.The recent major hack seen one top five biggest Bitcoin Ethereum exchanges , Bithumb South Korea , fall prey hackers . The hack confirmed July 5 information , well hundreds millions South Korean , made attack difference.Most exchanges know susceptible network intrusion via internal systems , entry point instance personal computer one exchange 's employees . Thus standard network compromise , rather sophisticated phishing attack led information heist.It personal information , names , email address phone numbers clients predominantly taken — luckily passwords — enough hackers target customers drain accounts cryptocurrency.Since highly publicized Mt . Gox hack 2014 , 800,000 bitcoins stolen , exchanges boosted security astronomically . Mt . Gox almost spelled end Bitcoin people lost lot faith — well lot money — security systems cryptocurrencies.While security boosted recent times , thievery hacking far less common , still threat ongoing sometimes hidden.In fact , Bithumb customers forwarded complaints Korean social media site threats attacks , yet much extra done part exchange try quell worries protect clients.The exact figure stolen still unknown Bithumb trying play less hack phishing attack information . However , despite trying convey , Bithumb admit 30,000 customers whose information compromised victims dangerous cryptocurrency attack.The Korean exchange come forward said compensating whose data compromised . Even customers would lost nothing data getting paid 100,000 Korean Won , equivalent around $ 86.50 USD inconvenience . The hope Bithumb able retain clients surely feeling much vulnerable less trusting.Bithumb 's transactions bitcoin make almost 3 percent entire market , share ether transactions ’ major claim fame : 13.5 percent total ether market goes Bithumb ’ exchange.It major blow big player exchange game , blow felt global digital currency sphere . Trust slowly rebuilt lived teething stages Bitcoin security , , door opens new mainstream markets , hacks like cause adopters second thoughts.However , one aspect digital security changed since bitcoin accepted much wider audience governmental agencies taking wing.There differing stages regulation digital currencies , arguably bring added security . In case Bithumb , Korea ’ Internet Security Agency plans initiate probe cyber attack full investigation follow.Ádám “ nopara73 ” Ficsór , HiddenWallet developer TumbleBit contributor , “ TDevD , ” pseudonymous Samourai wallet developer , joining forces new privacy project : ZeroLink . ZeroLink set realize trustless mixing scheme first proposed Bitcoin Core contributor Gregory Maxwell years ago — one ’ realized thus far.According Ficsór , ZeroLink framework , utilizes scheme known “ Chaumian CoinJoin , ” actually straightforward many alternatives proposed. “ Back 2013 , sort obsession decentralization . ‘ Everything decentralized decentralized ’ slogan , ” developer recalls . “ By realize decentralization actually always useful . As long mixer steal funds link transactions , ’ enough. ” CoinJoinEach Bitcoin transaction essentially sends bitcoins one several Bitcoin addresses ( really : “ inputs ” ) one several Bitcoin addresses ( really : “ outputs ” ) . That ’ bitcoins “ move ” blockchain.The problem , privacy perspective , blockchain completely public , means anyone see addresses paying addresses . If addresses linked real-world identities , reveal lot transacted , perhaps what.CoinJoin , well-known coin-mixing scheme first proposed Maxwell 2013 , potential solution problem . A CoinJoin transaction basically combination several transactions merged one big transaction . In words , includes inputs several different users , bitcoins move outputs controlled several different users . As , ’ clear bitcoins moved . All users effectively paid users.While ’ great , next problem whomever whatever combines different transactions one CoinJoin transaction central point failure privacy perspective . That person ( server , whatever ) still knows bitcoins moved . So individual either corrupt corruptible , problem ’ really solved. “ For CoinJoin live promise , even entity creates transaction must learn addresses paying addresses , ” Ficsór noted.ZeroLinkZeroLink provides privacy framework wallets used different mixing schemes . And defines mixing technique well : implementation CoinJoin referred “ Chaumian CoinJoin. ” With Chaumian CoinJoin , users send receive equal amounts bitcoin CoinJoin transaction , everyone receives 's coins . This obfuscates trails coins.In practice , ZeroLink users require two types wallets : pre-mix wallet post-mix wallet . As names suggest , first type holds coins mixed , latter mixed coins end up.Users connect pre-mix wallets ZeroLink tumbler provide input ( “ ” address ) output ( “ ” address ) , control . But importantly , outputs disguised ( “ blinded ” ) using mathematical trick . So tumbler knows bitcoins sent , yet know bitcoins sent to.At heart trick , tumbler cryptographically signs blinded outputs , using type cryptographic signature introduced David Chaum : “ blind signature. ” This allows data cryptographically signed even disguised . And importantly , signatures checked original , unblinded data well see blinded data unblinded data match.Next , users connect tumbler , time type anonymity network , like Tor . They provide tumbler unblinded versions outputs . Using cryptographic signatures created , tumbler check revealed outputs match blinded outputs . If match , tumbler knows outputs received legitimate , thus provided users also provided inputs send funds.The tumbler adds revealed outputs CoinJoin transaction . And sends transaction back users , users sign Bitcoin private keys . Doing validates transaction . ( The users course double check amounts outputs check , sure receive much send . ) Finally , tumbler broadcasts CoinJoin transaction included Bitcoin block . As result , users end different bitcoins started : bitcoins mixed , blockchain trails broken.While actually relatively straightforward compared alternative schemes , large extent already suggested Maxwell back 2013 , process never realized . This probably long thought vulnerable attacks , Ficsór thinks. “ When Maxwell first published proposal , Bitcoin transaction fees practically non-existent . Because , would relatively easy cheap launch denial service attacks CoinJoin mixing system . An attacker keep providing valid inputs , refuse sign . That invalidates whole transaction , wastes everyone ’ time. ” Interestingly , attack vector extent resolved simply would expensive keep going . In order maintain attack way ’ easily countered , attacker must provide new inputs round , meaning must able keep moving bitcoins new addresses . “ Assuming $ 1 transaction fees , could cost $ 1,000 day , ” Ficsór pointed . “ In particular context , high fees blessing disguise. ” DevelopmentFicsór currently help wrap development another highly anticipated privacy tool , TumbleBit , Stratis ’ Breeze Wallet . This expected take another three months.After , plans focus realizing ZeroLink , TDevD may even start working framework sooner . Concretely , three new codebases need developed : pre-mix wallet , tumbler post-mix wallet. “ The tumbler needs developed scratch . But relatively easy add pre-mix wallets existing open source wallet . The true post-mix wallet implementations , though privacy reasons wallets good fit , ” Ficsór said.His HiddenWallet well Samourai Wallet “ fully committed ” implementing deploying ZeroLink production , Ficsór said , Breeze Wallet may interested well.Optimistically , initial implementation ZeroLink could live end year.Governments central banks world gradually warming idea leveraging unique advantages offered blockchain technology — low-cost transactions permanently recorded tamper-proof distributed ledgers — modernize financial systems.According sources familiar matter , Indian government considering proposal introduce cryptocurrency similar Bitcoin , Business Standard reported last week . The new cryptocurrency would managed Reserve Bank India ( RBI ) could called “ Lakshmi. ” Other central banks exploring similar ideas.Of course , take time , governments unlikely support important features make Bitcoin cryptocurrencies appealing end users , mining near-anonymous , paperwork-free transactions . Therefore , Bitcoin , Ethereum least altcoins likely continue prosper.But governments , China ’ , ’ seem like . After banning Initial Coin Offerings ( ICO ) , Chinese government moving close cryptocurrency exchanges operating country.It appears governments love blockchain technology hate Bitcoin , well “ crypto-anarchic ” digital currencies . Some governments reacting panic starting realize ’ stop Bitcoin becoming alternative monopoly currency , means exchange store value . Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges especially vulnerable , governments could follow China.A Role Decentralized ExchangesDecentralized exchanges use peer-to-peer ( P2P ) technology bypass need central exchange provider interesting option could make blockchain-based digital currencies much resilient.Decred recently introduced atomic swap support exchange-free cryptocurrency trading , showing , least crypto-to-crypto trading ( example , exchanging bitcoin litecoin ) , ’ perfectly possible operate without exchanges . However , ’ solve problem crypto-to-fiat fiat-to-crypto trading , arguably top concern cryptocurrency users. “ Atomic swaps first sign new wave decentralization , ” Decred project lead Jake Yocom-Piatt told Bitcoin Magazine . “ As trustless exchanges pairs cryptocurrencies , offer new efficiencies users ’ need formality traditional exchanges . It going interesting see trend develops , since larger complex transactions fiat currencies , LocalBitcoins established exchanges still place be. ” Coinffeine developing open-source , P2P Bitcoin exchange platform enable users buy sell bitcoins securely anonymously , without rely centralized exchange . The project seems promising , ’ shown much activity recently.Bisq ( formerly Bitsquare ) provides open-source desktop application allows users buy sell bitcoins anonymously exchange national currencies alternative cryptocurrencies . To protect users fraud , traders required place security deposits multisig-based escrow mechanism ; deposits refunded trade completes . To handle disputes , Bisq features decentralized open arbitrator system . Bisq preparing launch decentralized autonomous organization ( DAO ) BSQ token , colored coin Bitcoin blockchain.Decentralization FreedomBitcoin Magazine reached Bisq developer Chris Beams comments government attacks cryptocurrency exchanges , likely attack vectors impact decentralized exchanges . Beams also offered passionate forceful defense individual liberty government over-interference. “ The panic set point , ” argued Beams . “ But different times different governments , produce range responses . I ’ think China ’ recent actions — whether ’ product panic something strategic — necessarily cascade similar actions U.S. Europe . Shuttering exchanges diktat kind textbook totalitarianism world come expect China , similar attack ’ work well U.S . Even would , would blunder U.S. attack Bitcoin blunt instrument . It would suboptimal , bad use available resources . It would strengthen decentralized exchanges already exist would incentivize creation better , even censorship-resistant ones. ” According Beams , U.S. particular much effective tools disposal , especially Know Your Customer ( KYC ) . The U.S. government forces nearly every centralized exchange , day one operation , collect personal identity information users correlate trading activity identities.Beams explained U.S. corporations tend take compliance seriously actually cooperate rules , meaning U.S. regulatory agencies , principle least , access enough information de-anonymize large growing percentage Bitcoin transactions . And plausible traceability transactions need keep threat tax collection force. “ If I U.S. , I ’ ushering new Bitcoiners Coinbase cattle gate fast prodded , ” said Beams . “ If I U.S. , I would long since concluded ’ nothing fundamental I stop Bitcoin , I ’ beat ’ em , I ’ least make sure I continue tax ’ em. ” The recent John Doe summons delivered Coinbase IRS shows KYC attack vector choice U.S. , could result billions taxes reported people fear Bitcoin activity audited . KYC appears much effective long-term attack vector heavy-handed shutdown orders. “ So yes , means , let ’ bring decentralized exchanges , ” said Beams . “ But ’ better really truly decentralized government stop , — least get big enough become worth effort . The attack vector decentralized exchanges ’ KYC , though , decentralized exchange implements KYC instantly abandoned users. ” The attack vector decentralized exchanges , said Beams , “ good ole four horsemen infocalypse. ” In words , decentralized exchanges vilified tools drug dealers , terrorists , pedophiles money launderers. “ It ’ script every time government interested talking people freedoms . This attack vector ’ work exchanges achieved escape velocity levels decentralization , may stop make life difficult others. ” Beams suggested way really stop decentralized crypto-fiat exchanges would outlaw Bitcoin trading altogether . “ This would force people think twice every trade , consider whether counterparty might agent , would result profound chilling effect. ” However , thinks sort heavy-handed attack seems unlikely attempted U.S. Europe many vested interests Bitcoin . It ’ likely authorities continue insist KYC , tolerate compliant centralized exchanges demonize decentralized ones. “ With said , I ’ actually optimistic , ” concluded Beams . “ Attacks state actors — real threatened — making every part ecosystem stronger . Bitcoin proven anti-fragile hell thus far , time battles waged , emerge side alternatives existing financial institutions — money , banks , exchanges rest — actually better every way traditional counterparts. “ We forced threat state violence design crypto-economic systems highest degrees security , privacy censorship resistance baked protocol level . That pressure propelling solutions forward , I think , bright future genuine financial freedom people . I ’ working stuff I thought otherwise. ” Imperva Incapsula , cloud-based service provider , released comprehensive report titled “ Q3 2017 Global DDoS Threat Landscape. ” The report shows cryptocurrency operators Bitcoin exchanges favorite targets distributed denial service ( DDoS ) attacks.A DDoS attack defined persistent DDoS event target ( e.g. , IP address domain ) . A single attack preceded quiet ( attack free ) period least 60 minutes followed another quiet period duration longer . Previous Imperva reports considered DDoS attack bursts separated 10 minute quiet periods , increased quiet period time threshold 60 minutes order aggregate successive attacks.DDoS attacks either network layer attacks cause network saturation consuming much available bandwidth application layer attacks bring server consuming much processing resources ( e.g. , CPU RAM ) high number requests ; often facilitated DDoS botnets . DDoS bots often masquerade browsers ( human visitors ) legitimate bots ( e.g. , search engine crawlers ) bypass security measures.The Imperva report based data 3,920 network layer 1,755 application layer DDoS attacks websites using Imperva Incapsula services July 1 , 2017 , September 30 , 2017 . Information DDoS botnets gathered analyzing data 37.4 billion DDoS attack requests collected period.Network layer DDoS attacks measured Mpps ( million packets per second ) Gbps ( gigabits per second ) , indicate , respectively , rate packets delivered total load placed network . Five percent network layer attacks reached 50 Mpps , largest peaked 238 Mpps.Application layer DDoS attacks measured RPS ( requests per second ) , overall impact also depends amount workload single request force target server . The main difference two DDoS-attack types one target network connections target computing resources ; requires different set security methods risk mitigation.The report noted cryptocurrency industry continues frequent target DDoS attacks , many larger industries . In fact , three every four bitcoin sites attacked Q3 2017. “ [ We ] saw attacks targeting relatively high number cryptocurrency exchanges services , ” states report . “ This likely related recent spike price bitcoin , doubled span quarter . Overall , 73 % bitcoin sites using services attacked quarter , making one targeted industries , despite relatively small size web presence. ” Other sectors frequently targeted DDoS attacks internet service providers online gambling gaming operators.For network layer DDoS attacks , U.S. , China , Hong Kong Philippines among top five countries , terms number attacks received number targets . Germany also frequently attacked , 12.8 percent total number DDoS attacks.Hong Kong 5.1 percent targets targeted almost third network layer attacks Q3 2017 . This largely due large-scale campaign local hosting service provider hit 700 times throughout quarter.For application layer DDoS attacks , U.S. highest number attacks highest number targets , Netherlands coming distant second . The largest application layer attack targeted financial services company headquartered Europe , hit multiple times . The remainder list include developed countries mature digital marketplaces , Singapore , Japan Australia.Identifying origination DDoS bots difficult practice faking source IP — called IP spoofing — make IP geo-data collected DDoS attacks unreliable . IP spoofing possible network layer attacks , however , since full TCP connections must established sending requests application layer attacks . Thus , data application layer attacks used identify bot location.In Q3 2017 , 17 percent botnet traffic originated China , represents significant drop previous quarter , China source 63 percent botnet traffic . Turkey India rise account 7.2 4 percent botnet traffic respectively . China remains top location attack devices 40 percent total.Application layer attack traffic generated bots bypass cookie challenges increased 6.4 percent Q3 2017 2.1 percent previous quarter . Of bots,1.8 percent also able parse JavaScript , increase 1.4 percent Q2 2017.South Korean exchange Youbit announced website today closing hack early Tuesday , December 19 , 2017 , resulted loss 17 percent assets.The exchange , previously known Yapizon , indicate many bitcoins cryptocurrencies stolen total fiat value attack amounted , enough lead bankruptcy.This second hack exchange suffered year . A prior attack April 2017 , resulted loss 3,816 bitcoins , worth around $ 5 million time.Youbit said hackers broke hot wallet , online account used pay cryptocurrencies instantly . While hot wallets offer greater convenience , also put funds greater risk connected internet.The remaining coins kept offline cold wallet , exchange said , resulting additional losses . The exchange indicated customers could withdraw 75 percent balances , rest would tallied final settlement.Korea Internet & Security Agency ( KISA ) , state agency responds cyberattacks , investigating incident , reported Reuters . KISA maintained North Korean hackers behind first hack.Chris Doman , threat engineer software security company AlienVault , told Bitcoin Magazine , suspects BlueNoroff , subgroup North Korea ’ cyber crime group Lazarus responsible second Youbit attack . Lazarus known November 2014 hack Sony Pictures Entertainment , one biggest corporate breaches history.While attacks Lazarus mainly aimed social disruption , recent reports indicate group increasingly going money . With value bitcoin surging all-time highs , exchanges becoming lucrative target. “ The first time I saw target Bitcoin company May year — month unleashed WannaCry , ” Doman said statement shared Bitcoin Magazine.The exchange Doman refering South Korean Bitcoin exchange Bithumb . Around time , WannaCry ransomware attacks encrypting user ’ computers offering de-encrypt exchange bitcoin . Analysis techniques used WannaCry attacks show strong links Lazarus . Doman added , “ They ’ also used related malware opportunistically mine Monero coins compromised servers . Clearly large interest cryptocurrencies easy method economic gain , well opportunity economically weaken enemies. ” Although Youbit one smaller bitcoin exchanges , hack underscores risk involved leaving funds exchange , control funds handed third party safe whatever security measures exchange chooses use.Throughout history Bitcoin , hacks amounted painful losses . When bitcoin exchange Mt . Gox began liquidation proceedings April 2014 , company announced approximately 850,000 bitcoins missing , amount valued $ 450 million time . In August 2016 , Bitcoin exchange Bitfinex announced hackers stole approximately 120,000 BTC , worth $ 72 million time.Following one largest hacks history cryptocurrency , Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck announced comply order Japan ’ Financial Services Agency improve business operations.On Friday , January 26 , 2018 , Coincheck hacked , resulting loss $ 530 million USD worth NEM ( XEM ) tokens . A full transcript announcement Coincheck executives found here.The core problem Coincheck keeping currency “ hot ” wallet , meant method storage connected internet . By contrast , U.S.-based Coinbase keeps 98 percent holdings offline “ cold ” storage . The hack ranks among largest cryptocurrency since launch bitcoin . Coincheck subsequently restricted deposits withdrawals currencies pending investigation resolution problems. “ We earnestly accept terms order vow re-examine business practices simultaneously striving make facts involved case clear , discover root cause breach , safeguard customers , develop stronger effective measures system risk management prevention similar events future. ” The exchange also announced reparations policy yesterday , January 28 , reimburse 523,000,000 XEM 260,000 users.The hack caused immediate 20 percent drop price XEM $ 0.79 , since recovered losses , rising $ 1.07 within 24 hours.Like Bitcoin , NEM cryptocurrency built top blockchain technology . Unlike bitcoin , uses Proof Work ( PoW ) , NEM uses Proof Importance ( PoI ) establish consensus blocks . PoI uses “ harvesters ” variation Proof Stake ( PoS ) model opposed miners used PoW methods generate tokens require special computing energy requirements arrive consensus . XEM name cryptocurrency associated NEM harvesting tokens stolen Coincheck.Vice President NEM Foundation , Jeff McDonald , told Bitcoin Magazine , “ Coincheck contacted us immediately , knew problem devised plan tag stolen coins news even hit media . The NEM technology fully intact , need hard fork code. ” McDonald said NEM immediately reached exchanges identified 10 different accounts XEM tokens went . All tokens tagged , anyone considering buying tokens able see stolen Coincheck exchange accept them. “ Had Coincheck used NEM multi-signature wallet , could happened , ” McDonald added . “ A third-party audit would uncovered problems , Coincheck single exchange Japan FSA licensed illustrates value good governance oversight space. ” Coincheck expected produce written report summarizing actions take improve security customer support Tuesday , February 13 , 2018.On Friday , February 9 , 2018 , Italian cryptocurrency exchange BitGrail announced “ internal checks revealed unauthorized transactions led 17 million Nano [ XRB ] shortfall , amount forming part wallet managed BitGrail. ” The shortfall reported allegedly worth $ 170 million presumably rendered BitGrail insolvent , despite fact wallets currencies exchange purportedly untouched.The 9:30 p.m. UTC announcement Florence-based exchange gives cause circumspection . The founder exchange , Francesco “ The Bomber ” Firano , fired salvos Twitter defense loss . His defense rang hollow BitGrail customers , however , Firano noted problem day prior withheld disclosure authorities , users public trying work issue Nano team.The “ Hack ” ? When news lost coins broke , BitGrail released statement citing “ unauthorized transactions ” later confirmed Firano result hack . However , appears many users taken Twitter accuse Firano BitGrail committing fraud , positing withdrawals severely limited exchange months across multiple coins transaction fees increased . The coins lost represent approximately 14 percent total outstanding value Nano mined.However , dispute ( discussed ) actually caused loss coins . Whether error BitGrail system , planned exit scam hack outsiders , taking keeping ill-gotten tokens seems ill-advised . The percentage coins taken represents five times current daily trading volume Nano would require careful offloading avoid driving price selling coins.Any scenario lost coins could dumped prior Nano coin gaining greater stability trading volume forecasts tumultuous time Nano team.Nano CoinThe Nano coin , previously known RaiBlocks , coin low level liquidity trades exchanges , ( previously ) including BitGrail . At time writing , CoinMarketCap lists volume coin $ 34 million trailing 24 hours . The XRB coin spiked high $ 31.14 January 2 , 2018 , currently sits $ 9.75 . Nano hosted first Meetup February 6 , 2018 , launched iOS wallet beta February 5 , 2018.BitGrail vs. NanoRelations coin exchange disintegrated weekend Firano accusing Nano team libel threatening call police “ irresponsible behavior , ” Nano retaliated “ tell ” Medium post . In de-evolution relations , Nano core team member Zack Shapiro ( deleted tweet user @ jsmoove08 ) defended BitGrail day prior exchange ’ announcement . The Nano team issued announcement response news . The team started : From preliminary investigation , double spending detected ledger reason believe loss due issue Nano protocol . The problems appear related BitGrail ’ software . We knowledge BitGrail ’ insolvency prior February 8th.It concluded accusation : We sufficient reason believe Firano misleading Nano Core Team community regarding solvency BitGrail exchange significant period time.Reactions Firano expectedly harsh , including one tweet stated : In wake unfounded accusations made dev team dissemination private conversations compromise police investigations , BitGrail s.r.l . forced contact police order protect rights users.It noted Nano team relayed Medium post would “ responding individual posts accusations Firano regarding situation. ” As BitGrail one exchanges accepting Nano , coin facing trading volume declines , $ 50 million reported Wall Street Journal February 10 , 2018.Nano also linked pdf private conversation Firano Nano core team members Shapiro Colin LeMahieu . The chat shows Firano ’ insistence loss Nano due issue corrupted time/date stamps errant transactions suggested fault lay Nano non-Nano wallets remained intact . Shapiro LeMahieu disputed claim . Firano also asked stolen coins could forked order recover “ stolen ” Nano burned address . The dev team refused acknowledge fork possible solution.Firano stated chat first noticed bug eight hours prior conversation Shapiro LeMahieu . Shapiro challenged Firano ’ timeline , asking , “ If withdrawals closed last month , notice ? Someone [ sic ] allegedly withdrawing weeks according via ‘ hack. ’ ” Social Media ReactsUsers social media seem sided Nano events , accepting narrative bug javascript client-side interface allowed wallets withdrawal coins exchange . Others , though , furious Nano dev team supporting BitGrail weeks leading loss funds.Regardless fault , turmoil caused loss $ 170 million worth Nano BitGrail exchange left exchange dev team faced accusations , angry customers little recourse affected.Identity verification paramount global freedom citizen access public services . We see many examples today terms barriers documentation adversely impact issues like democratic voting processes , especially among homeless communities refugee settlements.Today ’ developments blockchain technology enabling solutions many verification issues . The use distributed technology shows promise robust , cost-effective mechanism advancing identity trust governance.Civic , provider blockchain identity-verification technology , recently announced partnership technology platform Votem launch first Know-Your-Customer ( KYC ) system powered CVC token . This , according leaders companies , signals major leap forward ensuring security transparency KYC accreditation processes.Votem ’ platform provides citizens , organizations governments around world ability easily manage participate online voting . It designed improve effectiveness voting ensuring integrity process , including confidentiality voters ’ choices validity results , private- public-sector elections.Through partnership , Civic provide Votem trusted identity protocols , enabling secure transparent environment , without risks costs associated collecting storing personal identity information.An Early Use CaseFor Votem ’ public token presale accredited investors , commenced February 27 , 2018 , Civic registering authenticating presale participants without need usernames passwords . They also verifying identity person using blockchain-powered attestations.This process begins users storing identity documents using Civic app . Civic , turn , verifies identity potential participant Votem presale , necessary , conducts advanced Accredited Investor checks users U.S.Through use new model , Civic ’ decentralized ID verification KYC protocol laying groundwork security professionalism token sale effort , ensuring Votem ’ process secure start finish.Civic CTO Jonathan Smith said , “ This collaboration marks another milestone Civic ’ ecosystem on-demand , secure low-cost access identity verification services . This partnership especially impactful , first CVC-powered KYC , Votem also falls squarely line Civic ’ long-term vision bringing decentralized democracy life blockchain technology . With Civic Votem coming together , fair secure digital voting starts now. ” Pete Martin , CEO Votem , concurred : “ We believe set new standard token sales honored working regard . We also think sets groundwork long-term strategic partnership around secure accurate authentication voters since share common vision making voting secure , accessible verifiable . Votem founded improve free fair elections around globe partnership Civic , know solid partner help us achieve mission. ” Orchestrating Path ForwardIn phone interview Bitcoin Magazine , navigating traffic gridlock San Francisco , Smith said Civic excited first KYC/ICO project ’ actually powered Civic token , important milestone platform. “ Votem always close heart core mission involving empowerment democracy blockchain-based identity . This project highlights importance identity fundamental building block voting occur whether corporate system international government election. ” In light Civic ’ belief democracy hugely important element uplifting citizens , Smith noted Civic conversations various government entities throughout world . “ At end day , entity decide trust . That ’ big thing leap — I trust data I ’ given ? Blockchain [ technology ] much better solution terms facilitating strong measure trust KYC provisioning identity . Our partnership Votem offers great way demonstrate this. ” Blockchain identity verification platform Civic emerged Consensus 2018 clear progress updates identity attestation technology.The project imagines network validators service providers work together verify individual identities . A new platform user would submit relevant identity information validation smart contract , validator would review approval . If approved , validator would store references information blockchain , attesting validity . Anytime corresponding user needs submit identity information another service provider ( bank , government agency , etc . ) , service provider could request validator cross-check user ’ information blockchain ’ attestations verify identity.In practice , ecosystem could streamline identity verification procedures keep users participating service providers go lengthy ID checks whenever occasion arises.Coming Consensus 2018 , Civic showing ’ taking steps turn theory reality . These steps include first iteration ID codes protocol alongside revamped token economy white paper , — kicker — “ world ’ first crypto beer vending machine. ” The idea giving free beer may seem kitschy first glance , novelty matched means Civic ’ utility . Using Civic app , anyone verified platform scan QR code prove ’ legal drinking age . In partnership Anheuser-Busch , Civic unveiled vending machine Consensus 2018 , offering anyone used free brew.To Vinny Lingham , Civic ’ co-founder CEO , campaign ’ flashy promotion excuse crack open cold one . It ’ way prove , without relinquishing ID information , Civic utilize zero-knowledge age check : use case could applied alcohol purchases. “ It ’ proof concept , ” Lingham told Bitcoin Magazine interview . “ It could beers , weed , pharmaceuticals — lots things age restricted limited access certain people. ” This proof concept one many uses Civic ’ ID protocol , instruments responsible practical application technology . Their newly released ID codes another proven manifestation Civic ’ protocol , according team , ’ “ first-ever blockchain-based verification mechanism. ” While surfing web , anyone able use codes verify businesses , social media profiles , team members , advisors individual attested information blockchain per Civic ’ protocol . Lingham Civic team built ID codes ICOs cryptocurrency projects mind , wanting provide digital lie detector sorts allow investors steer clear fraudulent projects. “ One problems ICOs advisors fake , investors fake , teams fake , Civic , get verified , ” Lingham told Bitcoin Magazine . “ And [ investor ] quickly look site see whether people real. ” These ID codes core Civic ’ mission , nucleus composition feature could potentially revolutionize , society , verify information anything job applications vacation planning. “ We ton uses , ” Lingham said . “ It ’ everything verifying identities authors , journalists , etc . … printing ID codes business cards , luggage tags : anywhere want put ID information , make available somebody , use QR code Civic. ” All facilitated using Civic app , ’ , users ’ need even Civic ’ tokens ( CVC ) use services. “ That ’ beauty . You ’ Civic token use Civic . You need app. ” Still , ’ kept team revamping token ’ utility . With help Newtown Partners , blockchain investment advisory service co-founded Lingham , ’ also released fresh token-economy white paper . The team claims using game theory mathematical models economic incentives , newest version reimagines Civic ’ Identity Verification Marketplace . Special focus placed demonstrating CVC incentivize use circulation without providing monetary rewards dividends , practices given regulators leeway scrutinize tokens securities , especially staking rewards.To avoid running regulatory roadblocks , Civic took pains avoid practices might made token sale operate like securities offering , coaxing investors discounts bonuses . “ We looked way security sales done opposite everything , ” Lingham explained.Lingham believes Civic ’ token model design could serve example rest industry follow . To , end game practicality usability ’ attract big league investors entities ; ’ platform acts “ consumer-focused company , ” without everyday users , technology never mature beyond growing pains. “ We ’ focusing driving consumer adoption industry identity blockchain . Unless technology gets hands consumers actually find practical use cases , ’ going digital idea , device gets used . So ’ focused engagement building engaging experiences users. ” Cryptocurrency investigation enterprise Chainalysis releasing product called Know Your Transaction ( KYT ) designed help businesses track customers may involved illicit cryptocurrency-related activity . The company ’ clientele includes Federal Bureau Investigation ( FBI ) , Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) Europol.Per recent blog post , Chainalysis stated holds lot faith cryptocurrencies blockchain technology : “ Blockchains create new ways people build trust among transact using cryptocurrencies . Cryptocurrencies , turn , inspired people reimagine financial machinery powers world commerce . People collecting land virtual realities , conducting real-time payments computation services , buying collectible cats internet . This beginning worldwide access financial instruments. ” The venture ’ primary goal get banks involved cryptocurrency scene create world financial institutions offer services digital currency exchanges ventures , alleged fears money-laundering make somewhat tricky , explains reasoning behind product ’ release.Chainalysis ’ KYT provides “ real-time feedback ” transactions fuels relevant information company calls exchanges ’ “ transaction processing engines , ” executives raise alerts regarding risky customers monitor suspicious activity . The product testing phase amongst small group select customers , reported seeing “ 20X improvement speed account reviews. ” KYT released global cryptocurrency exchanges financial institutions.In addition , company also introducing multi-currency support . Chainalysis start bitcoin cash law enforcement customers looking expand 10 cryptocurrencies end 2018.Chainalysis recently landed approximately $ 16 million series A funding venture firm Benchmark , whose cryptocurrency-related investments include Pantera Capital Xapo back 2014.General partner Sarah Tavel , led deal Chainalysis , explained move smart choice , called Chainalysis “ meat potatoes ” company : “ All regulated institutions want participate [ cryptocurrency transactions ] , need understand transacting funds originating . We ’ solved traditional compliance requirements fiat world. ” Chainalysis founded 2014 Oxford economist Jonathan Levin Michael Granger , former COO San Francisco-based bitcoin exchange Kraken . The company employs 75 people boasts offices New York , Washington D.C. Copenhagen.Chainalysis rose fame selected investigate Japan ’ Mt . Gox debacle , saw roughly half billion dollars worth cryptocurrency disappear practically overnight . The reported mastermind alleged Russian cybercrime suspect arrested Greece last summer.Chainalysis ’ alone space . London-based Elliptic , also runs investigations relating cryptocurrencies , garnered $ 7 million funding institutions like Banco Santander bank Octopus Ventures expand operations product development team.MyEtherWallet , popular web-based wallet storing transmitting cryptocurrency ether ( ETH ) , suffered DNS attack rerouted unsuspecting users Russian scam site victims fed login credentials.An unsigned SSL certificate warned users entering phony site bypassed warning , resulting loss funds . MyEtherWallet confirmed attack statement April 24 , 2018.Hackers actually hack MyEtherWallet platform went vulnerabilities public-facing DNS servers instead . MyEtherWallet recommends users switch Cloudflare DNS servers time being.DNS servers provide correct IP address internet site ’ name . If type “ www.myetherwallet.com , ” DNS server translate IP address site . An SSL certificate protects spoofed DNS answers comparing hostname enter hostnames listed certificate . If match found , SSL warning pops up.Normally users attempt visit myetherwallet.com , directed Amazon Web Services , hosts site . But time , according cybersecurity firm CloudFlare , directed instead set Russian IP addresses.According Oracle 's Internet Intelligence division , hacker able hijack DNS entries executing BGP ( short Border Gateway Protocol ) route hijack redirected internet traffic meant Amazon servers . BGP , routing protocol used internet , known vulnerabilities . Most affected users employing Google ’ recursive DNS service. “ Little know part elaborate scheme use inherent security weaknesses DNS BGP pilfer cryptocurrency , remarkable scenario appears taken place , ” Oracle ’ Doug Madory wrote blog post.DNS hijacks uncommon . Earlier year , hackers hijacked DNS server BlackWallet.co , web-based wallet Stellar Lumens cryptocurrency , redirecting $ 400,000 worth lumens ( XLM ) server . In late 2017 , EtherDelta also victim DNS hijack , resulting loss least $ 267,000 funds.With crypto scams running rampant across globe , Human Trust Protocol , aka Hub , joining hands Civic , blockchain identification service provider , verify users via know-your-client ( KYC ) data gathered Civic secure identity platform ( SIP ) . The new project entitled ICO Hub algorithmic ICO rating service adds identity verification central rating factor : Hub representatives able identify ICO project team members organizers ensure platform ’ authenticity investors step in.Launched LinkedIn ’ original CTO co-founder Eric Ly , Hub works establish blockchain histories reputations granting users blockchain-specific tokens add platform ’ reputation data , thereby building online market presence.Civic seeks grant consumers say whether identities used real-time providing low-cost , on-demand secure identity verification technology boosts transparency legitimacy crypto space . Civic uses decentralized structure biometrics mobile devices , provides multi-factor authentication without usernames , passwords , physical tokens third-party involvement.ICO Hub built specific rating system . ICOs ultimately receive “ trust scores ” based authenticity organizers ’ claims users ’ outcome predictions.In statement , founder CEO Eric Ly explained , “ At Hub , objective help users develop manage reputation data incentivize meaningful authentic interactions online human trust protocol . Civic ’ secure private ecosystem enables decentralized , reusable KYC perfect fit , gives protocol users another means bolster reputation histories. ” CTO co-founder Civic Jonathan Smith told Bitcoin Magazine Wall Street Journal recently analyzed 1,400 digital coin offerings , found roughly 20 percent engage sort fraud , plagiarized investor documents fake executive teams. “ Within coin offerings analyzed Journal , nearly $ 1 billion poured fraudulent investments , far , investors claimed losses $ 273 million , ” states.Both Civic Hub believe collaboration ICO Hub contribute lasting trust blockchain space , boost users ’ credentials neighboring platforms , improve transaction efficiency. “ ICO Hub first algorithmic ICO rating system , unlike qualitative analysis-based rating systems , help companies towards self-regulation , ” Smith said . “ In time crypto projects constant scrutiny , help users stake tokens predict outcomes ICO projects , instead relying social github signals . Having strong ID verification service integrated algorithmic evaluation enable Hub significantly reduce risks related impersonation fake personas plagued ICOs allowed fraudsters run money undetected. ” Regulators consistently worked crackdown fraudulent ICO projects . Last February , Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) issued string subpoenas several ICO organizers , believing violation recent securities laws , speaking CNBC last November , Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin commented ICOs fake , intention offering anything valid investors.The advent smart contracts long drawn interest potential revolutionize business agreements . There ’ one problem , ’ one affected many spheres cryptocurrency space : knowledge gap . This gap exists people specialize conventional legal terms contracts specialize technological programming blockchain.On recent episode The Tatiana Show , host Tatiana Moroz interviewed Hartej Sawhney , president co-founder cybersecurity firm , Hosho . Calling back taxi cab Istanbul , Sawhney explained Hosho ’ business advantage developed around overcoming knowledge gap. “ We see cybersecurity company happens focus cryptocurrency/ blockchain space , ” said Sawhney . “ What ’ date building team white hat hackers , people strong background DevCon community. ” For unfamiliar DevCon , considered one world ’ largest well known hacker convention.Headquartered Las Vegas , Hosho focuses auditing smart contracts “ blockchain ” simulating cyber attacks test security different systems . In addition , Hosho also developing cyber securities solutions space multi-sig wallet Ethereum Telegram group bot detects phishing scams.Fraud MistakesSmart contract auditing remains core Hosho ’ work . “ Everything date mostly people taking advantage fundraising mechanism ICO Ethereum blockchain , ” said Sawhney . Auditing means developers checking make sure smart contract supposed do.Sawhney pointed auditing smart contracts shown knowledge gap comes finding developers competence Solidity , language used write Ethereum-based smart contracts , able perform audits . And , according Sawhney , side problem developers actually proficient Solidity , part , “ rich get bed. ” Hosho ’ strategy dealing knowledge gap finding people cybersecurity backgrounds teaching Solidity.Essentially , public , projects misfiring smart contracts fall category scams.At EthBerlin , gathering 7–8 biggest cybersecurity professionals space converge standardize smart contract audit entails . Given early state industry , Sawhney went say gathering , sorely needed , also well-timed establishing international framework self-governance one imposed entity outside industry.While Sawhney stated knowledge gap real problem industry , noted standards improving . “ In North America , every single exchange made standard check professional third party audit . Asia catching … The speed cryptocurrency gets listed Asia lot faster anywhere else . This also makes Asia exciting market. ” The New StandardHosho ’ standard smart contract auditing consists full audit language code smart contracts followed itemized list provided client quandaries Hosho identified capacity smoothly executed.After client addresses errors , Hosho provides second audit make sure contract ’ code fixed . Once approved , Hosho , effect , stamps code certify code audited third party : That seal valid point code edited again.Although seal interest legal teams government officials , Sawhney pointed , majority cases , “ one person reads report exchanges. ” This emphasis exchange approval tantamount making smart contract audits standard security procedure.Other TopicsLike Sawhney , Tatiana ’ two guests concerned establishing maintaining standards within cryptocurrency blockchain ecosystems . In addition Sawhney views cybersecurity , Connie Gallippi described journey forming Bitcoin nonprofit , BitGive , Bitcoin Magazine ’ managing editor , Christie Harkin , explained rules maintaining editorial objectivity cryptocurrency journalism well guidelines successful news story pitches.One major class attacks hit hacking landscape recently cryptomining . While cryptomining supports good cause done consciously , also allows nefarious actors make lot money fast , , sheer number cryptocurrencies available mine , becoming popular choice attackers.The technique essentially involves attacker taking advantage another person ’ computer using CPU power mine cryptocurrency . If malware configured consume large percentage CPU power , prevent CPU tasks effectively deny user access machine application.The malware mining work often done mining pools , collaborative framework allows numerous “ miners ” work together , thus increasing amount money attackers make collectively.So organizations protect systems attack ? Hitting TargetAttackers try exploit publicly available interface allow carry attack . Such interfaces include misconfigured services cloud like databases , caches , management tools like Kubernetes . For example , recent research Imperva shows 75 percent Redis servers infected cryptomining malware.Having said , web servers remain largest target attacker , since meant public.In fact , cryptomining grown popular , closing months 2017 , surge attacks , researchers saw 88 percent remote code execution attacks ( RCE ) sending requests external sources trying download cryptomining malware target machines.To carry cryptomining attacks , hackers first look RCE vulnerability , allows attackers run arbitrary code vulnerable server . For example , recent RCE vulnerability attackers used mine cryptocurrency related insecure deserialization . In types vulnerabilities , attackers tampered serialized objects sent web application . Then , object deserialized , malicious code run vulnerable server , allowed attacker mine cryptocurrency.Cryptomining attackers use similar techniques attacks terms infection , evasion persistency . However , cases , see malware samples try maximize attack , profit , either spreading network vulnerable devices injecting code server affects end users.In addition , cryptomining attacks prelude kinds malicious activity . If server infected , usually means vulnerable kind code injection . The vulnerability exploited infect server cryptomining malware reused infect malware launch attacks attacker ’ behalf . An infected end-point means attacker gained foothold internal network attack potentially spread machines organization.Although bitcoin probably best-known popular cryptocurrency , attackers mining bitcoin ; special hardware required mine coin , also bitcoin transactions private . This means coins traced back along transaction chain , means attackers higher chance getting caught.As result , attackers instead increasingly mining two types coins : privacy-focused coins like Monero , newer cryptocurrencies require less specialized mining equipment . These alternative cryptocurrencies allow attackers undertake transactions without fear traced back account balance seen , transaction reveal sender , receiver amount transferred.Protecting Against Cryptomining AttacksTo protect cryptomining attacks , organization try reduce attack surface much possible , limit public access assets whenever possible enforce rigid authentication processes.Cryptomining malware usually needs lot computing power , thus simple detection achieved monitoring CPU high consumption . However , cryptomining attacks programmed work radar . They specifically configured overload CPU , thus making difficult detect.To protect cryptomining attacks , organizations must first ensure systems fully date relevant patches . In order cryptomining successful , attackers must first take advantage vulnerability . However , organization date patches , entry point sealed.As attackers targeting RCE vulnerabilities web applications launch malware , patching crucial . By ensuring IT teams fully aware of— ensuring systems date — latest vendor patches , kinds vulnerabilities mitigated.Alternatively , virtual patching also utilized actively protect web applications attacks . This reduces window exposure decreases cost emergency patches fix cycles . A web application firewall provides virtual patching ’ interfere normal application workflow keeps site protected allowing site owners control patching process timeline.Taking ActionIllicit cryptomining effortless way nefarious actors make money slips radar victims . Plus , lucrative . The attack simple mount rapidly overtaking ransomware becoming prevalent attack vector . Although see type attack simply nuisance , cryptomining potential cause large scale “ brownouts , ” computer infrastructures collapse criminals fight compromised systems get hands cryptocurrencies.This guest post Nadav Avital , application security research team leader Imperva . Nadav dozen years experience working computer network security industry strong technical skills application security , hacking , operating systems ( Linux Windows ) , web architecture , Python PHP . Views expressed necessarily reflect Bitcoin Magazine BTC Media.On July 10 , 2018 , news broke cryptocurrency wallet decentralized exchange Bancor hit hack . A wallet Bancor team used update protocol ’ smart contracts infiltrated , $ 23.5 million vulnerability allowed hackers run $ 12.5 million ETH , $ 1 million NPXS tokens $ 10 million Bancor ’ BNT token.Following hack , Bancor team froze BNT question effort stanch losses.The latest kind , attack unfortunate reminder smart contracts foolproof . Even built blockchain ’ security intensive network , feature bugs , backdoors vulnerabilities ripe exploitation.Before Bancor , saw popular Ethereum wallet Parity drained 150,000 ETH ( worth $ 68 million ) July 2017 . In November year , Parity lost even less-experienced coder accidentally froze $ 153 million worth ether tokens.In perhaps infamous smart contract hack industry date , The DAO , decentralized venture fund , lost 3.6 million ether June 2016 . The stolen funds worth $ 1.6 billion , fallout attack saw Ethereum hard fork recoup losses.The Why How : Making Same MistakeIf three ’ company , The DAO , Parity Bancor become poster triplets smart contract vulnerabilities . But ’ alone weakness , similar smart contract bugs exploited nearly exploited networks.For nascent technology , flaws may expected , given mass sum funds contracts supposed protect , truly stalwart security measures yet routinely employed.To Hartej Sawhney , co-founder Hosho cybersecurity firm , sheer amount funds stake enough incentive attract black hats smart contracts , especially ’ central point probe access. “ There ’ money behind every smart contract , ’ incentive hack . And scary part smart contracts like Bancor ’ coded smart contracts way gives centralized power founders project . They ’ put backdoor , ” Sawhney told Bitcoin Magazine interview.Sawhney referring Bancor ’ ability confiscate freeze tokens , smart contracts govern wallet exchange feature central points control . This degree control widely criticized centralized point Bancor ’ able advertise decentralized exchange.And may even provided hackers entry point network . While Bancor revealed specifics hack execution , team wrote blog post “ wallet used upgrade smart contracts compromised. ” Sawhney indicated interview “ smart contracts coded irreversible , ” Bancor ’ completely mutable . The hackers could exploited — likely exploit — backdoor developers put place manage project.Bancor aside , Dmytro Budorin , CEO cybersecurity community Hacken , echoed Sawhney ’ belief industry ’ treasure trove assets powerful impetus hackers dirty hands . He also believes relative youth technology makes vulnerable detrimental exploits. “ Coding blockchain something new , ” Budorin added interview Bitcoin Magazine . “ We still lack security standards best practices properly code smart contracts . Also , coding smart contracts , programmers think functionality security , since programmer ’ main task simply make code work , security usually afterthought. ” Working new programming languages , security take back seat functionality . More casualty steep learning curve , Sawhney believes security slip eye software engineers “ ’ quality assurance ( QA ) mindset. ” With millions stake potential holes code exploit , hackers bound drum scheme breach contracts , according Budorin . Even team audited code expected known vulnerabilities , “ new type attack developed time nothing protect this. ” All takes spurt intuitive thinking probe smart contract ’ code unexplored opening , Amy Wan , CEO co-founder Sagewise , iterated separate interview Bitcoin Magazine. “ It often developers able write perfect code works first time around — even happens code adapted unforeseen situations . Code also static , makes smart contracts rigid . However , humans anything static creative comes problem solving . This combination creates something perfect storm , making smart contracts ill-suited bugs coding loopholes/situation changes. ” Wan believes “ technology n't tech much humans interact , ” meaning “ always going folks looking opportunities test shortcomings technology , may result hacks. ” To Wan , smart contracts feature intrinsic vulnerabilities . To make security matters worse , also holds “ amended terminated ( technologist speak , evolved upgraded ) , ” static nature renders susceptible dynamic , adaptive strategies black hats. “ Code aside , every situation , infinite number things go awry . The rigidity smart contracts presently accommodate fluidity real world , ” said.Mending Achilles HeelIf technical flexibility crux smart contract weakness , fix inception carry-through development . Developers put preventative measures place ensure code bend without breaking , CEOs expressed. “ We need comprehensive approach order solve problem long term , ” Budorin argued . “ First , even though impossible make contracts absolutely secure , smart contract risks reduced . The best way secure smart contract security engineer staff , conduct two different independent audits , launch bug bounty program dedicated period time deployment. ” Hacken facilitates bug bounties , platform , called HackenProof , seen white hat community audit test industry projects VeChainThor , Neverdie , Legolas Exchange , NapoleonX , Shopin Enecuum . Budorin team find bug bounties provide reliable tertiary buffer projects go public. “ We believe efficient way mitigate modern cybersecurity threats host bug bounty programs bug bounty platforms . This called crowdsourced security approach , ” Budorin explained. “ Bug bounty platforms attract crowd third-party cybersecurity experts ( dozens hundreds time ) test client ’ software . Testing ongoing months even years. ” Sawhney agrees projects need house on-staff security experts police vulnerabilities , lamenting fact projects lack CIO CTO effect . But also indicated , cases , companies need submit proper audit avoid fate similar Bancor ’ s. “ Some companies believe world ’ best engineers , think ’ need audit . And get one , chances ’ done third-party audit favor . Even ’ getting audit , audit companies ’ deem professional audit . They ’ taking code putting automated tooling . They ’ taking time manual tasks includes dynamic analysis , quality assurance , ” explained.The manual tasks Sawhney lauds heart Hosho ’ auditing processes . They allow Hosho ’ team sniff coding errors automated tooling might miss , like discrepancies smart contract ’ token algorithms white paper ’ business model. “ So manual part conducting audit marrying code words — call dynamic analysis . Most time find errors smart contract , ’ finding colossal errors business logic . We ’ finding everything mathematical errors errors token allocation , ” Sawhney said.He went reveal Hosho ’ team includes professionals “ infosec , defcon communities white hats spent years QA. ” QA , shorthand quality assurance , method coders test code designed function check malfunctions , defects flaws may render vulnerable inoperable.As Sawhney indicated earlier , part reason projects auditors ’ QA simply lack professional experience . It ’ easier , claimed , teach Solidity ( smart contract coding language ) know conduct sound QA way around.When lack QA training learning curve ’ issue , however , Sawhney suggested , times , projects ’ secure thorough audit ’ simply cutting corners. “ Sometimes I think ’ sheer laziness cheap . They see cost code smart contract $ 10k [ auditor ] charging $ 30k review . They say , ‘ Nah , ’ need . We best engineers world ’ good. ’ ” To Sawhney , ’ substitute thorough audit . He also holds , audit completed , smart contract come seal approval , one attests audit ’ quality reassures users code altered fact . For Hosho ’ work , comes form GPG file , cryptographic stamp simultaneously functions like certificate authenticity denotes final ( least recent ) version audited code , acting rather like seal bottle cough syrup proves ’ tampered since last passed quality control. “ Having central governments , regulators , lawyers , PR firms , investors , token holders — everyone — looking GPG file , sign approval [ answers question ] : Has code sealed ? Because monitor code ’ put seal prove one touched code , one line code changed since third party audited . If code changes ’ opening room security vulnerabilities. ” Wan ’ solution offers different sort prescription , adds post-audit safety nets like Sagewise ’ software smart contract ’ third line defense. “ Going forward , I believe blockchain companies able prevent smart contract disasters using smart contract developer whose sole focus developing smart contracts , hiring reputable security auditing firm , including catch-all safety net smart contracts , Sagewise 's SDK. ” The Sagewise SDK integrates smart contracts police malicious inputs . It gives developers chance freeze smart contract question adjust accordingly. “ It starts monitoring notification service users aware 's happening smart contract . Paired SDK , basically acts arbitration clause code , users notified functions executing smart contract , functions unintended , [ ] ability freeze smart contract . They take time need fix whatever needs fixed , whether 's merely fixing coding error amending smart contract resolving dispute , ” said.A Community Problem , Community SolutionIn interview , Wan claimed “ [ less ] 2 percent population able read code. ” Fewer people still able read Solidity , let alone level needed insulate airtight security features.So even projects companies want take measures necessary vet protect code properly , may wanting talent resources . This problem likely educated existence software engineers develop thorough , sophisticated understanding Solidity smart contract programming languages . More mature coding languages may present solution ailment , well.But time , community help developers teams err side caution . Like arbiter skin game , people using services need step demand action change , Wan believes . Otherwise types security breaches continue happen. “ [ B ] ecause much population read code , difficult hold developers accountable things like code administrative backdoor smart contract ( many large projects done ) , ” said Wan. “ Just 2017 alone , half billion dollars value lost smart contracts , apparently enough get developers consider adding additional safety nets community members demand . Perhaps need lose billions get people realize n't system work. ” Sawhney also reiterated point : “ [ More ] people need outspoken , call people . I think people scared community tight-knit everybody knows everybody . No one wants shun people . There ’ enough self-governance space , I think ’ biggest step community needs take. ” He added , “ [ ] enough pressure [ ] put security ; ’ enough regulation around security. ” In effort bring self-regulation forefront industry ’ list , Hosho partake summit cybersecurity firms Berlin . Slated September , Sawhney hopes ETHBerlin spawn self-regulatory organization ( SRO ) attendence , “ complete certificate work , kind like Big Four financial audits. ” Adding conversation self-regulation , Budorin finds community would well document exploited vulnerabilities . This would create library case studies situations developers study create solutions necessary avoid pitfalls future. “ ... blockchain community needs collect , store analyze known vulnerabilities found smart contracts host regular security conferences cover security issues blockchain develop security guidelines new generation blockchain programmers prepared problems , ” said.Both Hacken Hosho answering Budorin 's call security-centric conferences . Hacken hosting HackIT October 8-11 , cybersecurity conference `` bringing hackers [ ] crypto community together . '' In vein month , Hosho host HoshoCon , one first conferences focus blockchain cybersecurity . From October 9-11 , 2018 , community members come together Las Vegas , Nevada listen , learn discuss industry could better bolster security . While working toward proper security community effort , onus community alone , lion ’ share responsibility rests developers ensure code sound possible reaching audience . Together , however , industry ’ community architects may combine perspectives make smart contract hazards issue yesterdays.Until , Sawhney , Budorin Wan ’ perspectives — respective companies ’ purposes — provide healthy reality check industry ’ pain points . For mainstream adoption acceptance , points need addressed sort sustained sense confidence new technology.The Breeze Wallet Breeze Privacy Protocol public mainnet released open public . The wallet showcases Stratis technology — platform built visual basic apps blockchain solutions — places heavy emphasis privacy security businesses seeking implement business-to-business ( B2B ) transactions Stratis Bitcoin blockchain networks.The Breeze Wallet first scheduled release mid-2017 . Designed bitcoin wallet desktops , application would come TumbleBit — promising privacy advancement built top Bitcoin — give customers opportunity mix coins without need trust one another receiving wallets.Speaking Bitcoin Magazine last year , Stratis Founder CEO Chris Trew explained , “ We integrating TumbleBit ’ trustless secure solution works Bitcoin without forks. ” Based U.K. , Stratis startup offers end-to-end solutions development , testing deployment blockchain applications . Aside maintaining blockchain , Stratis also boasts native token , Stratis token , builds tools existing blockchains like Ethereum Bitcoin.Developers claim wallet boasts user-friendly interface , along dub Masternode Client Discovery protocol , Bitcoin Stratis blockchain used discover , validate connect Stratis Masternode . The process decentralized occurs trustless environment less vulnerable network disruption.Users employing wallet “ obfuscate ” transactions , meaning render obscure unintelligible . This primarily works ventures individuals seeking conduct on-chain business preventing business viewed public . If company receives regular payments customers makes payments supplier , would deemed commercially sensitive information would thus shielded.Companies also utilize wallet connect Stratis Masternode , thereby giving transactions added protection across Bitcoin Stratis networks . This primarily done TumbleBit , provides anonymity allowing several people utilize payment channels . The channels protected cryptographic puzzles prevent non-users gaining access information present.The Breeze Wallet compatible Windows 64-bit 32-bit , along Mac OS X Ubuntu.Many people know bitcoin anonymous digital currency , one whose privacy features prime concealed payments sketchy recesses internet ’ dark web.These people would likely surprised learn bitcoin far anonymous . More pseudonymous anything , underlying technology , blockchain , actually features number technical windows users could peep another user ’ identity . These interested parties , analytics companies , governments anyone sufficient IT knowledge , use peer-to-peer network analysis link Bitcoin public address IP address , allowing learn owns wallet ’ sending funds to.In tracing transactions public addresses back users ’ IP addresses , “ spies , ” also known “ adversaries , ” effectively deanonymizing users . An obvious breach privacy , Bitcoin community long wrestled solutions neutralize problem.Entering conversation Dandelion , protocol developed Giulia Fanti along Shaileshh Bojja Venkatakrishnan , Surya Bakshi , Bradley Denby , Shruti Bhargava , Andrew Miller Pramod Viswanath , researchers Carnegie Mellon , MIT University Illinois . If theory hold application , Dandelion would effectively neutralize peer-to-peer analysis plays significant role compromising user identity.The ProblemWhenever someone sends transaction Bitcoin ’ network , typically , transaction broadcasted multiple nodes picked miner included block.This broadcasting process known diffusion . It begins source node , node creates transaction , transmits nodes network . Once node broadcasts transaction , nodes make network continues independently diffuse transaction sending others exponential delays.Presenting Dandelion Building Bitcoin conference Lisbon , Portugal , Giulia Fanti explained source node ’ IP address often discerned “ diffusion susceptible detection. ” When collaborating spy nodes receive transaction , engage peer-to-peer network analysis retrace steps network.Basically , observing timing broadcast examining structure relays , spies trace — high probability ’ necessarily foolproof — transaction back source node . From , spy high odds gleaning IP address transaction sender.Dandelion ’ SolutionDandelion aims abstract transaction relaying process make complicated adversaries trace transactions . This would , essence , make nearly impossible follow breadcrumb trail broadcast timings relay structures lead back source node originally transmitted transaction.To achieve , Dandelion sends transaction random path variable number nodes transaction diffused across whole network . The random pathway known stem phase protocol , transactions relayed stage shared one another , transmitting one node next . The diffusion phase known “ fluff phase , ” transaction broadcasted multiple nodes spread across network ( visually effect , processes replicate Dandelion ’ anatomy , hence terminology ) .In stem phase , node randomly decides either continue stem phase relaying broadcast another node diffuse transaction rest network . If passed , next node randomly decides whether pass transaction diffuse . The transaction passed along , one one , one node triggers diffusion process.Adding first transaction phase diffusion meant provide added layer anonymity transaction broadcasting process . If network passes transaction multiple potential source nodes diffusion , , theory , obfuscate broadcast came , thereby making exceedingly difficult definitively trace transaction back source.Dandelion ’ GrowthDandelion ’ proposal considered feasible step toward solving Bitcoin ’ anonymity question ’ involve overhauling code entirely outfit kind peer-to-peer network obfuscation tools coin like Monero developing , example.The team often asked ’ implement onion routing Monero focusing . Fanti admitted talk “ Monero addressing exact problem [ Dandelion ] trying solve , ” qualified stating “ implementing actually really time intensive , ” Monero development team working since 2014.Focusing instead ground-up approach , Dandelion come way since first introduced 2017 . After peer review code found glaring holes , team revamped efforts re-released new white paper updated method ( known Dandelion++ ) May 2018.It ’ expected Dandelion implemented future Bitcoin Core update , though ready forthcoming 0.17.0 release.Origin Protocol , one early initial token offerings listed CoinList , announced launch new decentralized messaging service . Origin ’ latest offering could challenge encrypted giant Telegram , , decentralized , widely used within cryptocurrency community.Decentralized Options Origin ParticipantsOrigin Messaging designed meet need decentralized messaging system , Origin , entire ecosystem . The team believes core service marketplace . In words : “ Messaging [ ] critical component necessary facilitate meaningful transactions [ users ] . ” Speaking Bitcoin Magazine , Origin Co-founder Josh Fraser said company built belief “ buyers sellers ” able “ transact without rent-seeking middlemen. ” He continued , “ When cut middleman , also remove fees , buyer seller able get better price . We ’ passionate promoting free transparent commerce giving community stake network. ” The team expressed confidence decentralized , encrypted , real-time service best suit users . The Origin Messaging service designed leading research development engineer Yu Pan , co-founder PayPal top engineer YouTube.Origin engineer Micah Alcorn outlined features Origin ’ blog post . These include open-source framework secure , end-to-end encryption . According , user privacy paramount , one — including Origin National Security Agency ( NSA ) — ability eavesdrop user conversations.The platform also fully decentralized , built top OrbitDB , serverless , distributed , peer-to-peer database uses IPFS data storage IPFS pubsub automatically synchronize databases peers . Furthermore , entirely free though leverages Ethereum ’ infrastructure signing capabilities , messages published Ethereum blockchain , means associated gas fees.He also lists speed , auditability , ease use anonymity useful features new platform . Interestingly , Origin dApp ERC-725 compatible , means users create non-fungible assets used verify authenticity message recipient ’ identity.According Origin , “ ERC-725 gives smart contract alone control . This smart contract represents identity blockchain . You attach much identifying information identity smart contract want . You also get attestations trusted third-parties like Origin verify specific aspects identity add identity smart contract . You see example action Origin dApp Origin verify information like email address , phone number Facebook account . After Origin verifies control accounts , sign attestation behalf attach identity smart contract. ” Of course , users also option include identifying information choose known nothing Ethereum address.Origin first cryptocurrency project pitch decentralized messaging service . Obsidian , fork Stratis , example , launched decentralized messaging platform . Popular messaging app Telegram also plans decentralize services launching ICO , though took step back plan May 2018 canceling public portion fundraising.In appears seismic shift company ethos , digital assets platform ShapeShift launched new loyalty program called `` ShapeShift Membership '' require exchange users provide `` basic personal details , '' according blog post published September 4 , 2018.In post , ShapeShift Founder CEO Erik Voorhees said membership part “ loyalty program '' see platform collect personal information users rewarding range benefits , including higher trading limits , cheaper fees , early access new coins more.While ShapeShift long known `` exchange without accounts , '' model established `` reduce friction protect customers , '' pivot seems move away hands-off ideals distinguished cryptocurrency exchanges.Voorhees said change influenced three key factors , namely , user requests , increasing interest tokenization regulatory hurdles , latter , founder claims , requires exchange `` prudent thoughtful '' approach.Regulatory authorities across world become firm exchanges , countries require digital asset platforms comply know-your-customer ( KYC ) anti-money laundering ( AML ) laws operating region.On issue privacy , Voorhees said exchange still believes `` right financial privacy , '' believes `` foundational element civil society . `` `` We still firmly believe individuals , regardless race , religion , nationality , deserve right financial privacy , deserve right privacy thoughts , relationships , communications .

This miniseries compare different privacycoins privacy offered Bitcoin.In part one : Dash.BackgroundDash ( DASH ) among popular also controversial cryptocurrencies space today.Originally codebase fork Litecoin ( turn codebase fork Bitcoin ) , Dash launched founder Evan Duffield January 2014 Xcoin . The project quickly rebranded Darkcoin , seemingly reference Dark Wallet , now-defunct , privacy-focused bitcoin wallet project . Darkcoin rebranded second time early 2015 , current name Dash , stands `` digital cash. ” At time writing , Dash claims 12th spot cryptocurrency market cap lists , top five spot time early 2017.Much controversy surrounding Dash stems early days project . While coin premined , instamined . As cryptocurrency went live , miners created 2 million coins matter days . Quite significant amount , projected supply currently scheduled total 22 million , 8 million coins circulation today . According Duffield , one early miners , instamine accident . But instead fixing problem — example , changing protocol rules relaunching — decided coin would continue despite instamine.Since , Dash turned ( calls ) decentralized autonomous organization , DAO , prides first successful example organization . The DAO centers around Dash “ masternodes ” — DASH nodes stake ( proof ownership ) least 1000 DASH — help network certain ways , instance confirming “ instant transactions. ” In return , masternodes receive 45 percent newly generated DASH.Another 10 percent every block reward reserved Dash treasury . What happens funds decided masternodes vote . In practice , money funds Dash Core Group , effectively company behind Dash , today headed CEO Ryan Taylor.Additionally , part block reward funds various forms promotion Dash also external projects , including Arizona State University 's Blockchain Research Laboratory , legal cannabis industry payments platform , several initiatives emerging markets.While specifically marketed privacycoin , recent years Dash shift focus pitch . Although privacy still prominently featured Dash website promotional material , also emphasizes ease use low costs , apparently geared toward mainstream adoption . As particularly notable deviation privacy-focused past , Dash even established partnership blockchain analytics company Coinfirm . While details partnership implications remain somewhat unclear , ’ hard see partnership odd fit coin previously known Darkcoin.Which brings us privacy features.PrivacyDash actually offers one particular privacy feature , called Private Send . The Private Send feature conveniently offered drop-down menu Dash Core full node client Dash wallets.Private Send really implementation CoinJoin , privacy solution first proposed Bitcoin Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell . In Private Send , three users add coins together one big transaction , sends coins freshly generated addresses belonging three users . As , coins effectively mixed three participants , breaking blockchain trail ownership . This process automatically repeated eight times , ( hopefully ) different mixing participants , extra privacy.Like CoinJoin solution , Private Send require someone construct CoinJoin transaction . This done using Dash ’ masternode system . Dash users wish mix coins contact random masternode , collects coins different users , mashes together CoinJoin transaction . It ’ important note masternode steal coins.However , mean Dash users must trust masternodes privacy . After , mixing masternodes link sending receiving addresses together ; know exactly coins going . If masternodes run spies share information spies ( purpose accident ) , Dash users gain less nothing : They ’ privacy , revealing would liked privacy.Granted , Dash user mixes coins , odds decrease mixing masternodes leak information . * However , optimize uptime ( collect block rewards ) , many masternodes appear run virtual private servers could compromised relatively easily one go , example government-sponsored spies . Further , many masternodes could controlled people ( keep mind 25 percent coins mined first week ) , means switching might even help much.It ’ also worth noting Private Send require users take specific step mixing , turn requires time , effort comes ( modest ) fee . As , users care privacy likely partake mixing process ; users feel nothing hide . This potential downside mixing could considered suspect . And trail ownership broken blockchain , history mixing still visible.BitcoinBut perhaps importantly , CoinJoin really unique . The technology first proposed Bitcoin , also available Bitcoin . The notable powerful CoinJoin solution available today Chaumian CoinJoin , embedded ZeroLink framework , , turn , implemented Wasabi Wallet well Bob Wallet announced Samourai Wallet.Similar Private Send , ZeroLink lets users add coins together one big transaction , sends coins freshly generated addresses belonging users . But importantly , unlike Private Send , mixer case unable link sending receiving addresses . Clever cryptography helps break link , without needing trust anyone.While Dash , GUI-interface , offer user-friendly CoinJoin solution point time , privacy guarantees weaker Bitcoin — never mind serious contenders like Monero Zcash . Needless say , cryptocurrency , least , promoted privacycoin , quite disappointing.Or Maxwell — whose CoinJoin invention used Private Send — described Dash ’ privacy features : LOL.Based blockchain technology , cryptocurrencies open public ledger . While required systems work , comes significant downside : Privacy often quite limited . Government agencies , analytics companies interested parties — let ’ call “ spies ” — ways analyze public blockchains peer-to-peer networks cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin , cluster addresses tie IP addresses identifying information.Unsatisfied Bitcoin ’ privacy features , several cryptocurrency projects , years , launched specific goal improve . And without success . Several privacycoins among popular cryptocurrencies market today.However , detailed month ’ cover story , Bitcoin ’ privacy features recently seen significant improvements well set improve next months years . This miniseries compare different privacycoins privacy offered Bitcoin.In part 3 : VergeBackgroundVerge ( XVG ) originally launched 2014 “ Dogecoin Dark ” Justin Sunerok , still lead developer project today . To cultivate serious image , project rebranded “ Verge ” 2016 . As codebase fork Dogecoin , base protocol similar Bitcoin many ways . ( Dogecoin codebase fork Litecoin , codebase fork Bitcoin . ) Verge news several times past year , notoriously coin successfully 51 % -attacked multiple occasions . But Verge probably best known partnership major porn site Pornhub , made headlines crypto media beyond.At time writing , Verge ( XVG ) claims 39th spot altcoin market cap lists , top-25 spot earlier year . This makes fourth ( last ) privacy-focused altcoin market cap top 50 , Monero , Dash Zcash.PrivacyAccording subtitle Verge “ Black Paper , ” describes project , Verge “ privacy focused cryptocurrency. ” However , even Verge project leaders appear bit equivocal point . Describing ( seems refer ) Monero “ private , ” Verge Currency Beginner ’ Guide written published Verge Currency Core members instead argues privacy optional.This optionality represented Verge ’ “ Wraith protocol. ” The Wraith protocol would let users choose whether want conduct regular transaction ( like normal Bitcoin transaction ) RingCT transaction , similar Monero . RingCT transactions include “ decoy ” coins transactions obfuscate coin really spent also hides amounts involved transaction everyone payer payee.However , RingCT transactions actually yet implemented point time . As , Verge users make regular transactions.What implemented optional stealth addresses . Stealth addresses perhaps best understood cryptographic puzzles . They essentially allow sender XVG generate brand new Verge address send XVG , claimed owner ( owner ) stealth address . The main benefits several Verge addresses generated stealth address stealth address linked actual addresses blockchain anyone payer payee . This means stealth address posted online , perhaps donation address , without user needing worry privacy.But Verge ’ main privacy offering probably different type privacy : privacy peer-to-peer network layer.The peer-to-peer network , course , nodes transmit relay transactions blocks one another . Unfortunately , network spied , specifically deploying nodes track data receives nodes . If done right , information used figure certain transactions originated . If spies link originating node IP address , ’ gone long way toward de-anonymizing creator transaction.Verge counters peer-to-peer network analysis nodes wallets communicate Tor . By transmitting transactions privacy-preserving , onion routing network , Verge users escape prying eye spy . Tor integrated different Verge wallets default , even including mobile wallet Android.BitcoinSince RingCT ’ delivered yet , privacy features offered Verge today stealth addresses Tor.Of , stealth addresses counter blockchain analysis — extent . This good feature , especially specific use cases ( like donation addresses ) . But also bit limited . Besides , simply generating new ( regular ) address payment ( standard many Bitcoin wallets also possible Verge ) sharing address anyone payer ( ’ difficult ) offers similar privacy cases . Further , stealth addresses also available Bitcoin ( via Samourai Wallet ) .As , Verge ’ real differentiator would Tor integration . This well-established solution counter network analysis , fact Verge offers default good privacy standpoint — though Tor slow network bit.However , Verge ’ really unique regard either . Bitcoin also used Tor , cryptocurrencies . Granted , sometimes require technical knack , everyone . Verge offers user-friendly experience regard.Bitcoin likely adopt Dandelion , recent proposal counter network analysis . This solution ’ encrypt network traffic like Tor , uses clever trick obfuscate source transactions goes long way achieve goal less overhead . That said , Dandelion implemented yet.The much bigger problem Verge network analysis one strategy de-anonymize cryptocurrency users . And ’ almost certainly main one : blockchain analysis probably offers spies much de-anonymizing data . As long addresses linked real-world identities , address clustering tools go long way toward breaking user privacy . In world large chunk transactions KYC/AML compliant exchanges , protecting privacy peer-to-peer network alone probably ’ achieve much all.Thus , least RingCT implemented , Verge reasonably considered privacycoin par Monero , Zcash even Bitcoin — considered privacycoin first place . It definitely “ privacy focused cryptocurrency. ” When Tokyo-based Mt . Gox got hacked tune 650,000 bitcoin 2014 , Japan learned early tough lessons cryptocurrency theft . Yet , day , despite country ’ ongoing efforts educate investors ramp oversight crypto exchanges , still feels sting hackers.On September 20 , 2018 , heels Osaka-based Zaif heist , amounted $ 60 million losses , country ’ National Police Agency ( NPA ) issued report cryptocurrency thefts involving exchanges individual crypto wallets first half 2018 . Japanese news outlet Asahi Shimbun first report information.According police authorities , first six months 2018 , cyber thieves made startling 60.503 billion yen ( $ 540 million ) cryptocurrency . Of stolen money , 58 billion yen came exchanges , remaining 2.5 billion yen taken individual crypto wallets.During time period , 158 instances theft — triple number period last year . In fact , entirety 2017 saw 149 breaches , amounting losses $ 6 million.NEM coin accounted share hacked funds , majority taken Coincheck breach earlier year . Bitcoin losses $ 7.66 million resulted 94 breaches . Ripple ( XRP ) accounted $ 13.5 million losses 42 instances theft.Finally , 14 cases theft involved ether , native cryptocurrency Ethereum platform , totalling losses $ 542,000.Sixty percent ( 102 incidences ) 158 total reported incidences due individuals using ID password cryptocurrency accounts email online shopping — no-no anyone trying safeguard online assets.Lessons learned Coincheck heist . After rattling event , Japan ’ financial watchdog , Financial Services Agency ( FSA ) kicked efforts bring exchange operators line newer security measures , brought laws went effect April 2017.Between January 2018 March 2018 , 76 percent ( 120 cases ) crypto thefts reported . After , due part NPA encouraging people use better passwords , number crypto thefts dropped . And April 2018 June 2018 , 38 cases reported.Tech Bureau Corp , company operates Zaif cryptocurrency exchange , received two warnings NSA year lax security measures likely receive another , regulators utmost reduce cryptocurrency losses country.Home › Articles › Brave Publishers Can Now Have Their Identities Verified CivicBrave Publishers Can Now Have Their Identities Verified Civic Brave Publishers Can Now Have Their Identities Verified Civic Civic , digital identity firm , collaborated Brave , privacy-based browser blockchain-based digital advertising platform , provide identity verification services Brave ’ content creators .

In , described proposal called “ Mimblewimble ” ( reference Harry Potter spell ) , presented radical slimming-down Bitcoin protocol.Now , two years later , two projects close realizing versions Mimblewimble protocol , launched separate cryptocurrencies.The first project developed group mostly pseudonymous volunteer contributors , several using Harry Potter-related screen names — like “ Ignotus Peverell , ” started project . They call upcoming cryptocurrency “ Grin ” ( yet another Harry Potter reference ) , implemented coding language Rust . Similar projects like Bitcoin Monero , Grin maintained specific company foundation , ICO anything sort ; instead , project accepts donations . Once launched , miners able mine one coin ( “ grin ” ) per second average , ( unlike Bitcoin ) rate never decrease . Grin currently tested roughly expected launch early 2019.The second project announced recently called Beam . Beam implemented coding language C++ ( like Bitcoin Core ) . More comparable Zcash , Beam launched maintained for-profit company name ( currently headed Israeli entrepreneur Alexander Zaidelson ) , though maintaining role later transition non-profit foundation . Beam also founders ’ reward : Beam company foundation receive 20 percent newly mined coins first five years . It ’ yet announced Beam ’ emission schedule look like , ( unlike Grin like Bitcoin ) capped . Beam also tested right scheduled launch December 2018.PrivacyMimblewimble combines versions several cryptographic tricks designed Bitcoin . In addition , utilizes clever math completely strip typical blockchains look like.The first trick Confidential Transactions ( CT ) , also deployed Blockstream ’ Liquid sidechain Bitcoin . Confidential Transactions let users blind ( hide ) amounts involved transaction sender receiver know much money involved . Using cryptographic trick called Pedersen commitment , anyone else still perform math blinded amounts . This lets verify sending receiving end transaction equal , hence coins created thin air.The second trick CoinJoin , originally proposed Bitcoin Core contributor Gregory Maxwell . CoinJoin combines several transactions one big transaction , senders send money receivers . If done right , obfuscates addresses ( “ inputs ” ) paying addresses ( “ outputs ” ) .In Mimblewimble protocol , however , taken big step . By combining CT CoinJoin clever math , Mimblewimble gets rid traditional private keys , public keys addresses , keeping inputs outputs ( technically thing addresses ) . It also gets rid traditional signature per transaction , essentially replaced little bit “ excess transaction data ” proving ownership coins.Interestingly , Mimblewimble miners take individual transactions would included block instead turn whole block essentially one big “ CT CoinJoin steroids ” transaction.The end result “ CT CoinJoin steroids ” something seems alien compared standard blockchains use today . Looking Mimblewimble block — combined transaction transactions — completely unclear inputs paid outputs , completely unclear many coins involved individual transactions . If enough people use Mimblewimble ( better ) , hardly trace funds established , presenting tremendous boon privacy.Furthermore — arguably makes Mimblewimble truly special — protocol design allows old new transaction data cancelled . This allows radical form pruning : old transaction data forgotten . New nodes ’ need sync whole blockchain , amount data nodes need store grow much slower typical blockchains.Where privacy features projects often conflict scalability , Mimblewimble ’ powerful privacy scaling properties go hand hand.WeaknessesThe innovative Mimblewimble architecture come drawbacks . These include absence scripts ( makes blockchains programmable ) requirement wallets interact create transaction ( sending money address ) — drawbacks worked around , extent.More importantly , context article , Mimblewimble , , counteract types blockchain analysis . If implemented naively , Mimblewimble leaves room type analysis peer-to-peer network closely resembles traditional blockchain analysis.Specifically , spy could deploy node network — like node — receives forwards ( ) individual transactions . But — unlike node — spy node would also record individual transactions . While transactions would subsequently combined big “ CT CoinJoin steroids ” transaction miner , ’ late : The spy already knows inputs paying outputs . ( Though ’ still learn much money moving around . ) This problem completely unsolvable ; Beam project made suggestions already . But ’ also completely solved.One proposed solution combine transactions users even hit network , similar CoinJoin-related privacy solutions Bitcoin . This would help users involved , would also face drawback similar Bitcoin : Those users feel “ nothing hide ” may want bother added hassle . This , effect , weakens privacy could even raise suspicion use it.A second proposal add “ dummy ” outputs transactions , containing zero coins . By ( automatically ) spending dummy outputs later block , obfuscates money really moved . This maneuver also comes increased cost , however , risking everyone use . ( On upside , ’ hurt Mimblewimble ’ long-term scalability transaction data would cancel disappear . ) A third proposal aggregate transactions spread network , potentially combined Dandelion-type peer-to-peer obfuscation technique . * If nodes keep adding transactions know big CoinJoin-like transaction forwarding , “ snowball effect ” would make exceedingly hard spies learn anything useful . This solution quite challenging implement , however , introduces several new problems . ( But combined dummy output solution , benefiting potential . ) All brings us Mimblewimble ’ biggest obvious “ weakness ” : Grin Beam still works progress . The potential Mimblewimble protocol promising , much depends specific implementations , making impossible say exactly strong privacy guarantees projects compare Bitcoin privacycoins.Brendan Eich , CEO Brave , written letter U.S. Senate Committee Commerce , Science Transportation urging implement GDPR-like legislation United States.GDPR stands General Data Protection Regulation works secure data privacy individuals within European Union ( EU ) European Economic Area ( EEA ) . In addition , addresses exporting personal data outside two organizations . GDPR seeks give individuals control personal information simplify regulatory atmosphere international business ventures.Based San Francisco , Brave new kind browser allegedly offers users faster speeds stronger security blocking trackers advertisements . In letter , Eich describes GDPR “ great leveler ” says allowed many new businesses Europe flourish preventing larger , established corporations disadvantaging them. “ The GDPR ’ principle ‘ purpose limitation ’ begin prevent dominant platforms using data collected one purpose one end business benefit parts business way currently disadvantages new entrants , ” Eich writes. “ In general , platform giants need ‘ opt-in ’ consent purpose want use consumers ’ data . This create breathing space new entrants emerge. ” Eich says GDPR-like standards adopted several countries around world including China , Brazil , Japan , India , South Korea Argentina . Together , countries make roughly 51 percent world ’ overall GDP experienced higher levels efficiency innovation business markets.Eich believes U.S. move similar direction , country keep competitive edge affirm reputation leading global tech hub.Furthermore , suggests GDPR-like protocols establish greater trust within United States businesses customers , necessary track people ’ movements online : main reason simply generate ad-based revenue sites customers visit . Since late 2017 , approximately 615 million devices built block ads tracking activated , suggesting growing level unease distrust amongst everyday consumers. “ A GDPR-like standard United States establish foundation trust enable innovation growth , ” writes . “ This certainly applies online media advertising industry . Contrary industry colleagues , I believe tenable platform , publisher , technology vendor trade body claim must track people generate revenue advertising … Trust return GDPR-like laws begin curtail online advertising industry ’ worst practices. ” Tracking movements garner ad revenue occurs process known online behavioral advertising ( OBA ) . Data collected sites consumer visits . Ads selected display consumer based past maneuvers . Eich says OBA occurs via several third-party networks operating quietly “ opaque processes ” central authority held accountable . In words , form “ behavioral tracking , ” questions ethical safe really is.Recently , Eich filed privacy complaints Britain Ireland internet giant Google playing “ fast loose ” customers ’ private data . In initial complaint , Eich said Google offers intimate data consumers several hundred companies without knowledge auction place ads . He claims goes GDPR requirements personal data processed way consumers remain secure.In addition , Facebook height scandal earlier year revealed data firm Cambridge Analytica gathered private information millions social media users without knowledge used political purposes . Cases like suggestive tech companies garnered much power , user data usually threat compromised.Interestingly , GDPR also offers “ right erasure ” clause , subject ’ collected data immediately erased company ’ records granted information gathered unlawfully , longer needed , subject question withdraws consent data used . This could present issues blockchain-based companies , information blockchain recorded real-time ensure irrefutable evidence transactions relevant data.At time , one primary requests among investors engage crypto-transactions via blockchain improved privacy anonymity . Heightened usage privacycoins like Monero Zcash proof , means statutes similar GDPR could line ideologies privacy-focused blockchains.GDPR based standards United States initially endorsed back 1980 legislation known OECD Guidelines Protection Privacy Transborder Flows Personal Data . This legislation included definition term “ personal data ” similar offered GDPR . Also , Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) fighting GDPR-like features 10 years.Brave company stands gain little , anything , directly GDPR-like legislation implemented United States . While Brave browser protects user privacy restricts advertisements , GDPR-like legislature would simply push forward Eich company already believe : users deserve privacy online data . Eich ’ letter reiterates societies around world shifting toward paradigm level playing field internet United States follow suit.Most digital exchanges unregulated therefore unqualified safely process cryptocurrency transactions . They ’ employ necessary know-your-customer ( KYC ) tactics , roughly $ 1 billion digital asset funds stolen since start 2018.These unsettling claims made new report released blockchain virtual currency forensics firm CipherTrace.The popular target currency still appears bitcoin , one document ’ key findings roughly 97 percent bitcoin used illegal transactions stem criminal activity sent unregulated digital exchanges enforce weak anti-money laundering ( AML ) tactics . An exchange considered lacking AML mechanisms regulate illegal drug dealing , maintain records time , report suspicious large transactions , enforce KYC regulations , report details.In addition , nearly 5 percent bitcoins received unregulated exchanges come criminal transactions , world ’ top exchanges laundered much $ 2.5 billion BTC.To uncover findings , researchers CipherTrace examined 45 million cryptocurrency transactions roughly 20 world ’ largest dominant exchanges . A transaction marked “ criminal ” came dark market website means extortion , ransomware , malware terrorist financing.To fully comprehend damage , authors also examined crypto funds reported stolen 2017 see last nine months devastating . According report , $ 900 million $ 1 billion reported stolen 2018 taken first three quarters year , meaning amount theft tripled since last year.However , losses ultimately blamed massive Coincheck hack took place January . That one theft large enough account half reported losses CipherTrace ’ study . Other major hacks occurred throughout 2018 include South Korean exchanges Bithumb ( $ 30 million ) Coinrail ( $ 40 million ) , well Japan-based Zaif ( $ 60 million ) .While document discusses several methods crypto theft , common one appears phishing , mass , customized extortion occurs email electronic means garner cryptocurrency-based ransoms . Other common methods include advanced malware targeting employees cryptocurrency exchanges directly.The report also mentions SIM swapping . Though report indicates still relatively new method theft , SIM swapping insidious process victim ’ phone number transferred thief ’ SIM card . The thief uses number change passwords access victim ’ accounts.Researchers also mention many regulatory actions taken crypto-hackers , many occurred third quarter . Among prominent AMLD 5 , passed European Commission July 9 , 2018 . The new ruling states January 20 , 2020 , AML counter terrorism funding ( CTF ) laws presently applied banks traditional financial institutions also apply digital currency platforms . AMLD 5 also enforces identity checks every new customer.In addition , Financial Action Task Force ( FATF ) looking apply present standards designed traditional monetary establishments virtual currencies end June 2019 . It also seeking ensure standards implemented every nation . Currently , several countries FATF classifies “ rogue states , ” regions deny compatibility FATF goals refuse cooperate . These include Syria , Pakistan , Iran , Tunisia Yemen among others.However , authors take note several countries working instill appropriate regulation virtual currencies blockchain businesses . Two really stand Malta Canada , former established several licensing requirements initial coin offerings ( ICOs ) similar funding ventures scheduled go full effect November 1.Canada also seeking bring crypto regulation new heights requiring payment processors digital currency exchanges treated money service businesses ( MSBs ) . This require stronger KYC rules crypto-related business . Should law pass , go effect late 2019.North Korean cybercrime hacking group The Lazarus Group currently biggest crypto hacking syndicate world , stolen millions worth cryptocurrencies online exchanges . Also known HIDDEN COBRA , works behest North Korean government , Lazarus Group responsible world 's largest cyber attacks including Sony hack 2014 , Wannacry ransomware outbreak , military espionage number attacks South Korean businesses.In report acquired news outlet HardFork , cybersecurity outfit Group-IB outlines trends hi-tech cybercrime , detailing 14 different attacks cryptocurrency exchanges since January 2017 . It suggests Lazarus responsible disappearance $ 571 million cryptocurrency.What interesting data Group-IB large majority targeted exchanges domiciled South Korea , Bithumb , YouBit Coinrail.This data appears confirm accusations made member South Korea ’ parliamentary intelligence committee North Korean government stolen cryptocurrency worth billions last year South Korean exchanges.Hackers target cryptocurrency exchanges favor traditional methods tools spear phishing , social engineering malware . According cybersecurity group , hackers able steal 10 percent total funds raised initial coin offering ( ICO ) platforms past year half , 50 percent funds lost phishers.Cybercriminals create fake web pages , simulating real project , tricking investors desperate jump next big thing . The report notes large phishing groups become skilled craft , steal much $ 1 million day.One incident stands creation phishing sites Telegram 's ICO project , allowed thieves scam would-be investors Telegram 's ICO . Gramtoken.io prominent fake website period . It built authenticity stealing details Telegram 's white papers , project roadmap more.Phishing schemes also take form investor database theft hackers resell darknet use blackmail crypto holders.While attacks ICOs might dwindled wake clampdown U.S. Securities Exchange Commission , Group-IB believes previous attacks ICOs remain threat crypto project attracts investors . The group also predicts phishing scams wo n't go away anytime soon , become harder detect fraudsters unveil new tricks tools perpetrate crimes. “ Fraudulent phishing-schemes involving crypto-brands get complex well cybercriminals ’ level preparation phishing attacks , ” report warns . “ Automated phishing use so-called ‘ phishing-kits ’ become widespread , including attacks ICOs. ” The cybersecurity group sees future state-sponsored hackers , like Lazarus Group , could target large mining pools , 51-percent attacks seem increase. “ In 2017 , successful 51-percent attacks detected , [ happening ] often . In first half 2018 , five successful attacks registered direct financial losses ranging $ 0.55 million $ 18 million , ” report concluded.After recent hard fork upgrade protocol , Monero seen transaction fees shrink approximately 97 percent , dropping 60 cents 2 cents . Crypto analytics firm Coinmetrics shared tweet confirming drop fees corresponding reduction transaction size , falling 18.5kb pre-fork 3kb — 80 percent change.The upgrade , called “ Monero 0.13.0 Beryllium Bullet , ” implements `` bulletproofs. ” First introduced researchers Stanford , cryptographic scheme shrinks size cost transactions specifically Confidential Transactions . Why Bulletproofs ? As stated , Bulletproofs scaling complement Monero ’ Ring Confidential Transactions ( RingCT ) , Monero 's main privacy feature , uses combination ring signatures Confidential Transactions . Ring signatures cryptographic digital signatures protect user 's privacy input side transaction making nearly impossible determine actual signer transaction is.To achieve privacy , Monero transaction includes additional , extraneous coins ( decoys ) mask exact coin signed , making extremely difficult parse real coins sent decoys . Before upgrade , six decoys added Monero transaction -- , ten featured each.Bolstering privacy provided ring signatures , Confidential Transactions let users hide amount exchanged transaction leveraging cryptographic trick dubbed Pedersen commitment.While RingCT format makes transactions private , also makes system less scalable cryptocurrencies , notably Bitcoin . Bulletproof shrinks size cryptographic proof , cuts transaction size drastically . While Monero ca n't get rid old transaction data , currently 20 gigabytes growing — total 60 gigabytes — recent upgrade ensures network requires less storage space transactions used to.Season 2 Distributed Dialogues begun , general theme connection major , real-world problems possible solutions using blockchain technology .

The company working public release EY Ops Chain PE EY Blockchain Private Transaction Monitor 2019.Wasabi Wallet 1.0 went live today , October 31 , 2018 . The release , Wasabi ’ creator Ádám Ficsór humbly called “ nothing revolutionary , ” cleans software makes compatible macOS. “ The 1.0 release download run works properly platforms ( Windows , Linux , OSX . ) We made wallet load time faster , caught memory leaks , [ ] rewrote OSX backend UI library used , ” Ficsór told Bitcoin Magazine.A self-described “ open-source , non-custodial , privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet , ” Wasabi ’ anonymity features center around ZeroLink , protocol introduced creator , Ádám Ficsór . The protocol privacy framework Ficsór architected resurrecting transaction cloaking method first proposed 2013 soon forgotten.Known Chaumian CoinJoin , transaction trick works name would imply . Essentially , bundles transactions together obfuscate sending . To work , however , party needs sending amount , otherwise would easy discern difference bitcoin sent sending receiving coins.Ficsór focused CoinJoin brainchild ZeroLink came implemented TumbleBit Stratis ’ Breeze Wallet . The feature offers similar privacy benefits CoinJoin , though centralized participants receive different coin one send.In correspondence , Ficsór said Wasabi ’ CoinJoin feature “ seen 150 BTC [ transacted ] equal output amounts , ” something , combined team finding “ remotely serious issues , ” made Ficsór company “ pretty confident promoting software 1.0. ” He also indicated , updated version ’ tinker CoinJoin protocol way , include fundamental changes invention ZeroLink. “ I designed ZeroLink mind many wallets would able conform ‘ wallet fungibility requirements , ’ however ’ feasible practice … The idea let people ever join two coins together already mixed … To mitigate risks , come clever labeling system led us road build coin control feature intra-wallet blockchain analysis tool Wasabi . This allows user make educated decisions coins join together need to. “ Later , saw people use wallet , even got better . When designing ZeroLink I anticipate users keep remixing coins , extent leads exponential anonymity increase re-mixes perfect mixes , today , 40-60 percent mixes remixes . So quite surprising turn events , ” said.Ficsór stressed conversation latest release places heavy emphasis user experience . Going forward , team try iron technical kinks even create smoother , user friendly experience — funds manpower allow , is. “ We currently occupied working stability , performance , UX code quality . This highest priority . New issues constantly come new users try use software . At point , unclear Wasabi ever resources tackle things. ” A South Korean ICO defrauded private sale investors roughly 13,500 ETH ( $ 2.8 million ) disappearing internet entirely.Pure Bit , already pulled plug website , apparently conducted fairly routine exit scam Pure Coin token sale . The cryptocurrency pitched exchange token Pure Bit , exchange supposed launch end month . The Coin promised give investors shares exchange ’ trading revenue well discounted fees trading , anonymous team claimed would burn 90 % token supply three year period.A block explorer ICO ’ Ethereum wallet displays several in-bound transactions investors beginning November 4 , 2018 . On November 9 , 2018 , however , initial 500 ether transferred , remaining 13,178 withdrawn 20 minutes later.Not evidence company ’ existence destroyed immediately , however . A thread Reddit captured last moments exchange took several screenshots translations original Korean.According Reddit user u/Tbid , evidently watched saga unfold , Pure Bit crypto exchange announced ICO launch exchange token . Almost immediately ICO ended , however , funds spirited away another single wallet address.As depicted attached screenshots , community admin quickly kicked every participant Kakao chat thread , sending final message “ Thank You. ” This information corroborated Twitter thread , added admin ’ message now-defunct Kakao profile terse excessively formal apology.Between wallet transfers , suspicious website activity admin ’ explicit apology , exit scam by-the-book come . Duplicitous activities recurring threat world ICO launches , forms large part reasoning South Korea banned ICOs altogether.Having committed crime even stealing vast sums money , anonymous administrators Pure Bit likely extensive legal troubles . As one commenter Reddit thread remarked , South Korean government likely “ hot tails. ” Even without threat exit scams , South Korean law enforcement well-used dealing routine cybersecurity threats , world ’ largest crypto hacking syndicate , literally sponsored North Korean government , targeted South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges number occasions . International cybersecurity solutions provider Group-IB come scoring model grade crypto exchanges based level security.The scoring model created Group-IB conjunction Swiss-based Cryptolns ( operated Swiss insurance broker APIS AS ) , grading intrinsic CryptoIns ’ new cryptocurrency exchange insurance , allow exchange users cover 15 BTC worth digital assets held exchange accounts . With scoring model ’ data , CryptoIns calculated rates coverage depending exchange ’ level security asset-protection measures.This insurance available assets held leading exchanges like Binance , OKEx , Kraken Huobi , full list found CryptoIns ’ website. “ Currently , approximately 3,600,000 BTC stored user accounts cryptocurrency exchanges , making market highly attractive hackers , ” Timofey Volkov , CEO CryptoIns , explained.Per recent Forbes article , crypto exchanges attractive hackers due design : They centralized single point failure , making prone problems faced millions web applications globally . This assessment Group-IB gets interesting investor.The grading Group-IB took exchanges ’ architecture infrastructure consideration better understand mechanisms used countering potential threats.While developing framework insurance policy , Cryptolns revealed assessed number exchanges using various parameters , including “ level technical security [ ] reliability key storage , password , personal data customers provided exchange. ” Explaining challenges faced insurers crypto industry , Volkov stated : “ Collaboration one leading international cybersecurity companies help us organize conduct pre-insurance evaluations exchanges order assess security , well potential fraudulent activities part founders management. ” Risk GroupsThe scoring CryptoIns also sorted exchanges four risk groups based aggregated information includes `` assessment traded volume , traders ’ activity , internal fees characteristics . '' Exchanges categorized first group graded least vulnerable , second third `` rated satisfactory low security risk , '' fourth group deemed overly risky , company saying wo n't provide insurance exchanges.Base insurance rates put 2.5 percent per quarter . Each groups entitled different discounts maximum 50 percent discount , report states.According CryptoIns ' insurance calculator website , U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken ranks safest digital asset platform lower cost insuring assets . It costs users 0.0125 BTC every 1 BTC stored Kraken 1.25 percent insurance rate . The 1 BTC insured Binance Bibox 0.019 BTC 0.025 BTC , respectively.Falling overly risky group exchanges like Yobit emerged least secure . Other less-secure exchanges , according list , Zaif , Bitstamp , Bit-Z TopBTC.Cyber threats crypto exchanges become recurring event . In September 2018 , Japanese digital assets platform Zaif reportedly lost $ 59 million due security breach system . Bithumb , CoinGrail BitGrail lost $ 30 million , $ 40 million $ 195 million , respectively , earlier year.In becoming emerging trend , Twitter accounts popular brands hacked attempt scam unsuspecting users cryptocurrencies.Target Google two high profile targets seen accounts taken hackers , turn , used scam followers advertising fraudulent crypto giveaways.Google 's G Suite Twitter Account Hacked ! ! Target 's Twitter account , followed nearly 2 million users , posted tweet , confirming hack occurred November 13 , 2018 . The retailer stated : '' Early morning , Twitter account inappropriately accessed . The access lasted approx . half hour & one fake tweet posted time bitcoin scam . We regained control account , close contact Twitter & investigating . `` Seemingly targeted hacking syndicate , Google 's G Suite Twitter account breached hours Target fell victim . The hack Google marked tactics one plagued Target — scammy tweet ridden typos promising free bitcoin G Suite 's 800,000 followers.A Google spokesperson confirmed hack Business Insider statement : '' This morning unauthorized promoted tweet shared G Suite account . We removed tweet investigating Twitter . `` These incidents sophisticated version Twitter scams become constant nuisance cryptocurrency community . Typically , scams include bad actors merely imitating popular figures crypto industry near-identical profiles , though ’ rare real accounts taken advertise scams.While 's unclear scammers gaining access brands ' social media account , 's obvious new measures needed combat scams.Criticized past failure devise clear defense incidents , Twitter reportedly working counter security measures prevent similar breaches like one witnessed Target platform future.Earlier year , anti-fraud software company MetaCert released Cryptonite , browser extension safeguards users fraudulent accounts.A bug centering around new Ethereum token , GasToken , enabling abuse cryptocurrency exchanges , appears resolved . The details provided report originally published November 13 , 2018 , discussed bug exploited attackers , digital platforms could wished protect hot wallet funds.It unclear exchanges could could affected bug . Thus , private disclosures issued “ many exchanges possible ” according Medium post . While determined exchanges danger , vulnerable exchanges since instilled proper protections . At press time , bug longer considered threat.According website , GasToken Ethereum-based contract allows individuals tokenize Ethereum network special refund mechanism . Users store gas price low garner refunds ’ high.The website reads , “ Every transaction network must include gas , fee paid miners transaction directly proportional gas consumed transaction . GasToken allows transaction amount work pay less gas , saving miner fees costs allowing users bid higher gas prices without paying correspondingly higher fees. ” The document alleges many exchanges either enforced gas usage limits allowed withdrawal ether arbitrary addresses . Combined GasToken ’ refund structure , open doorway subsequently provided attackers , could mint gas whenever received ether make exchanges pay arbitrary computation.Attackers could exploit bug one two ways . The first performing computations Ethereum ’ fallback function contract received Ethereum-based tokens exchange . If malicious actor wanted attack exchange , attacker could initiating withdrawals contract address controlled.Granted person operating exchange failed enforce gas limits know-your-customer ( KYC ) protocols , exchange would pay transaction fees hot wallet . The attacker could create several accounts bypass single account withdrawal limits . They could also mint GasTokens , thereby causing exchange owner ’ wallet drain even further.The second attack vector could exploited token ’ transfer function . The attacker could force exchange pay large amounts computation even cause burn ether supply.From , attacker could drain exchange ’ hot wallet mint GasTokens profit controlled token ’ code exchange token featured upgradeable contract exchange automatically lists tokens . Whenever token transfer occurred , attacker could work update function , would perform computation described first method , exchange would pay costs every future transfer token.The good news bug could affect exchanges initiated Ethereum transactions processed . Thus , decentralized exchanges based similar smart contract technology processed transactions initiated users likely remain unaffected.The report listed several options ensure problem ’ persist . For example , authors suggested implementing reasonable gas limits transactions . That way , particularly expensive transactions occurred , users would bear costs , ensuring exchanges remained free clear charges.In addition , exchange operators advised enforce gas monitoring rate limiting withdrawals . Most exchanges usually incorporate either one , neither tactic much . Lastly , Ethereum-based contracts told implement gas usage restrictions making calls unknown addresses.In demonstration titled “ Wallet.fail , ” team security researchers hacked Trezor One , Ledger Blue Ledger Nano S. Unfortunately , appears findings first put display 35th Chaos Communication Congress ( 35C3 ) Leipzig , Germany , rather accepted Responsible Disclosure practices , would allowed manufacturers patch vulnerabilities protect customers potential attack . Fortunately , vulnerabilities appear difficult attackers actually exploit.The team experts included security researchers Dmitry Nedospasov , Josh Datko systems engineer Thomas Roth . Among vulnerabilities revealed presentation several could fixed firmware upgrade hardware wallets question.SatoshiLabs , manufacturers Trezor wallets , Chief Technology Officer Pavol Rusnak , insisted company notified vulnerabilities demonstrated event , going add 's `` Responsible Disclosure program '' researchers could followed give heads-up loopholes . `` With regards # 35c3 findings @ Trezor : informed via Responsible Disclosure program beforehand , learned stage . We need take time fix , 'll addressing via firmware update end January . `` Ledger took exception , claiming blog post sidelined researchers , could notified disclosure , claim would given firm time needed `` vulnerability patched well mitigate risks users . `` The VulnerabilitiesAs vulnerabilities , appears ( yet ) exploited remotely ; require intruder physical access devices question — sometimes access owner ’ computer well.At presentation , security experts claimed flashed Trezor One hardware wallet , allowed extract mnemonic seed ( PIN ) RAM , going add vulnerability exploited users n't set passphrase.The team also claimed installed firmware Ledger Nano S , allowing manipulate wallet signing transactions remotely . To , intruder would physically access Nano S hack victim 's PC , malware installed steal PIN victim loads Ledger 's Bitcoin app.Ledger claims since scenario requires intruder physical access device , access victim 's computer patience wait victim put PIN launch Bitcoin app PC , type attack unlikely pose much practical threat.The security researchers also demonstrated proof-of-concept , side-channel attack Ledger 's expensive hardware wallet , Ledger Blue . According team , Ledger Blue leaks signals sent touchscreen radio waves , making vulnerable . This due animation PIN keyboard . The researchers claim signal could get stronger USB cable attached device , allowing sniff PIN Ledger Blue remotely.Privacy-focused bitcoin wallet Samourai hand forced Google.According Samourai blog post , wallet provider disabling privacy features key design latest version , 0.99.4 , hits Google Play store tomorrow . The removed features include Samourai ’ Stealth Mode , remote text message ( SMS ) commands , SIM Switch Defense ( measure protect sim swaps ) .The privacy restrictions affect version wallet available Google Play . To bypass restrictions , users also download Samourai calls “ non-nerfed version ” wallet client ’ latest version directly project ’ Github . Down road , team also hopes get wallet , privacy features fully-enabled , listed F-Droid alternative , open-source app stores , well. “ In October , Google announced changes policies regarding SMS Dialer permissions apps allowed use . The way Stealth Mode , Remote SMS commands , SIM Switch Defense work require use permissions , ” Samourai Wallet representative told Bitcoin Magazine email correspondence.Samourai proceeded file exemption , notified exemption ’ rejection “ days ago , ” according representative. “ Unfortunately , n't tell us anything specifically , learned everything automated emails could responded , ” continued.Samourai available Android , part ’ pin iOS developers “ willing work passion profit , ” representative indicated . The project ’ “ much luck iOS developers far , ” “ committed bringing version Samourai iOS store eventually , ” claimed.With restrictions , Samourai lamented changing landscape Android past versions . These changes , Samourai ’ words , created “ walled garden , ” something wallet provider discusses blog post reiterated correspondence. “ Very strict changes background data versions ago meant Samourai users would longer receive alerts incoming payments unless routed alerts Google ’ servers . We obviously decided , — view — beginnings walled garden built . The latest policy changes regarding SMS Dialer permissions show marked change strategy Google , bringing closer alignment Apple iOS Store ever before. ” If users opt download wallet directly Samourai ’ Github , team cautioned “ verify integrity APK download comparing SHA-256 hash APK SHA-256 hash published Github. ” At time publication , Google responded Bitcoin Magazine ’ request comment.On January 26 , 2019 , clients peer-to-peer bitcoin trading service LocalBitcoins targets phishing scam resulted theft handful bitcoins.The Scam ’ OperationReports claimed attacker able conduct scam thanks security vulnerability LocalBitcoins platform . The landing page site ’ forum reportedly hacked , leading clients phishing site.The phishing site designed carefully mimic features actual LocalBitcoins landing page . Once , users prompted log provide sensitive , two-factor authentication codes.As soon hackers gained access codes , users bitcoins wallet stolen. “ We would like inform today 26.01.2019 approximately 10:00:00 UTC , LocalBitcoins detected security vulnerability – unauthorized source able access send transactions number affected accounts . Outgoing transactions temporarily disabled investigated case , ” LocalBitcoins noted Reddit post.A user claimed hacked able identify address hacker , later found address received total 7.95205862 BTC five , separate transactions ( equivalent $ 28,134 press time ) .LocalBitcoins Safe Again ? According announcement made LocalBitcoins Reddit , exchange claims vulnerability system surfaced flaws third-party software exchange uses forum . In addition , LocalBitcoins stated security team able find extinguish issue quickly.It confirmed vulnerability allowed attacker gain access undisclosed number accounts , although press time , knew six cases users affected.It reported exchange mitigated vulnerability blocking user access wallets issue resolved . Also , exchange suspended trading activities short period developers worked neutralizing threat . The platform returned full functionality hours hack.The team noted vulnerability fixed . However , mention whether affected users compensated losses intend track stolen bitcoins.The post also noted platform ’ forum feature would remain disabled security reasons , , buyers sellers able interact platform ’ ciphered P2P chat.On February 4 , 2019 , blockchain tech company Blockstream announced development “ proof reserves ” tool standardize authenticity exchanges ’ crypto reserves . The Bitcoin development company submitted Bitcoin Improvement Proposal ( BIP ) bitcoin-dev mailing list consideration.Blockstream stated “ open-sourcing development tool feedback industry. ” Citing high-profile hacks reason services would demand , Blockstream hoping create “ best-practice standard Proof Reserves industry , offers broad compatibility way Bitcoin exchanges storing users ’ funds. ” Blockstream stated original idea tool build means Liquid functionaries prove Liquid bitcoin ( L-BTC ) reserves third-party auditors . But soon recognized applications could reach beyond Liquid useful cryptocurrency exchanges general. “ Put simple terms possible , Proof Reserves allows exchange prove many bitcoin could spend , without needing generate ‘ live ’ transaction exposing risks moving funds. ” Reducing Security RisksAs technology envisioned currently , tool able circumvent typical problems associated proving cash reserves , namely security risks associated current verification methods exchanges typically employ . With help tool , exchange “ first constructs single transaction spends exchange ’ [ unspent bitcoin ] . ” Basically , function aggregates cryptocurrencies sitting exchanges wallets transaction , instead sending transaction — creating potential attack vector — tool deliberately “ sabotages ” . The transaction still shows wallets question assets , none assets get moved around . In way , none exchange ’ actual assets risk spent attacked , amount currency still verified. “ This transaction data shared anyone needs verify reserves . They simply import data Proof Reserves client confirm exchange ’ total holdings addresses associated holdings. ” Removing Need TrustThe problem Proof Reserves tool intended alleviate technical barrier prevents users checking reserves exchange may want transact . In words , ’ difficult non-technical users verify reserves , forcing trust exchange operating good faith.And plenty questions surrounding veracity reserve claims crypto space could make customers uneasy placing trust exchange . On February 5 , 2019 , example , Canadian court granted cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX bankruptcy protection appointed Ernst & Young monitors help exchange locate funds could use reimburse customers.Following death QuadrigaCX ’ co-founder CEO Gerald Cotten , exchange claims lost access $ 190 million deposited funds , alleging Cotten one able access encrypted laptop keys passwords stored . This caused many users question whether exchange actually stated funds reserve.Third-party verification actual cash reserves could help potential users identify whether exchange operating good faith acceptable standard practices.Privacy ConcernsThus far , however , Blockstream ’ verification tool least one area significant concern : reveals entire transaction history participating exchanges . If problem persist , tool could used unmask users ’ transactions exchange question . Although glitch would obviously completely impractical confidentiality reasons , underlying premise tool work , blog post states Blockstream hopes create fully confidential version help new open-source development process.U.S.-based digital asset platform Coinbase acquired blockchain intelligence startup Neutrino .

It gives us great pleasure able reimburse traders loyal us believed us difficult time.Devasini also reiterated exchange ’ willingness help investigators inquiries , calling individuals useful information hack reach “ finally resolve situation mutually beneficial manner. ” The Hack Bitfinex ’ Retrieval EffortsTwo years ago , crypto community woke news 119,756 BTC stolen wallets Bitfinex one largest crypto exchange hacks since Mt . Gox breached 2014.The exchange generalized losses across accounts , crediting BFX tokens every dollar lost hack . Tokens redeemed dollar exchanged company ’ stocks — chose hold shares BFX tokens converted Recovery Right Tokens ( RRT ) .Per announcement , recovered tokens currently converted USD paid holders RRT. “ The benefit RRT holders event retrieval stolen property , outstanding unconverted BFX token holders reimbursed , recovered funds distributed RRT holders , 1 dollar per RRT , ” statement reads.The New Zealand-based crypto asset exchange Cryptopia made assessment January hack , claiming 9.4 percent assets stolen.In January 2019 , exchange went offline publicly reporting “ major security breach , ” likely resulted theft least $ 3 million USD . Promising involve several nation ’ law enforcement agencies , Cryptopia ’ announcement also stated exchange ’ functionality trading services would suspended notice.The exchange , well Cryptopia ’ website , still late February . Users left largely dark updates site ’ functionality Cryptopia ’ plans deal fallout hack.On February 26 , 2019 , exchange ’ Twitter account began posting several updates situation . First , claimed calculated worst-case scenario January ’ hack : 9.4 percent holdings exchange . Later day , tweets account suggested exchange making preparations reopen trading securing individual accounts , though later tweet instructs users deposit funds old wallet addresses . Cryptopia ’ Twitter account promising future updates come regarding site ’ reopening.According Chainalysis report issued beginning February 2019 , likely hack several others perpetrated two groups , dubbed “ Alpha ” “ Beta. ” These hackers displayed sophisticated method funneling stolen crypto assets variety wallets exchanging said assets fiat without leaving trail investigators could follow.When Coinbase acquired Neutrino unspecified amount February 2019 , news looked like business usual : A cryptocurrency juggernaut made another acquisition . But company question , specifically ties unethical practices one predecessors , suggests monolithic Coinbase may joining oligarchic ranks privacy-hostile , too-big-for-consumer-comfort counterparts legacy tech.The Ties That DamnOn website , Italian blockchain analysis company Neutrino proudly advertises proprietary software offers all-in-one “ solutions law enforcement ” “ financial services. ” Its two flagships , XFlow nSpect XFlow nSight , billed “ comprehensive solution [ ] monitoring [ , ] analyzing tracking cryptocurrency flows across multiple blockchains. ” nSight built help exchanges financial service companies like Coinbase stay regulatorily compliant . nSpect , hand , built “ criminal investigations intelligence gathering ” specifically marketed toward law enforcement.Continuing work Coinbase , Neutrino team , three-man show consisting CEO Giancarlo Russo , CRO Marco Valleri CTO Alberto Ornaghi , strangers building complex computer monitoring software law agencies.In another life , Hacking Team , notorious Italian software services firm whose dubious business practices made antagonist wider tech privacy community . Hacking Team got start Valleri Ornaghi ( aliases NaGa ALoR ) sold man-in-the-middle attack software police force Milan , Italy , 2003 . These two founders would later joined Russo , acted COO company.Throughout history , Hacking Team sold services oppressive regimes Saudi Arabia , Morocco , Sudan , Kazakhstan , Bahrain Turkey , among others . These services centered around Hacking Team ’ proprietary Remote Control System ( RCS ) software , Trojan horse malware gives users ability remotely access files , record keystrokes , take photos read emails infected device.Email leaks reported The Intercept trace team ’ cyber footprints human rights abuses around world . Hacking Team ’ RCS technology used Ethiopian government ( ranks one oppressive Africa , penchant silencing free speech ) surveil interfere operations Ethiopian Satellite Television Radio , news outlet run Ethiopian expats . The technology helped Turkish government spy American , also sold Sudanese National Intelligence Security Service 2012 whopping €960,000 ( around $ 1,210,000 time ) , though team shuttered Sudan ’ access software 2014 government ’ clumsy implementation software showed ’ “ enough prepared product usage , ” Hacking Team emails reveal . It also played part murder journalist Jamal Khashoggi Saudi Arabia assault arrest UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor.Reporters Without Borders labeled Hacking Team one five “ Enemies Internet ” 2013 role humanitarian abuses journalists.During 2012 uprisings Morocco inspired Arab Spring movement , RCS , control Moroccan government , singled Mamfakinch.com , outlet published journalists vocal critics regime . The leaked emails prove Hacking Team selling software Morocco since 2010 . This would culminate Mamfakinch ’ hardware infected Trojan horse virus , originally masqueraded news tip. “ Mamfakinch.com came first citizen media portal document protests , providing tools like mapping protests also articles . At time started , I member . I asked join later one co-founders , ” Zineb , pro-democracy activist involved Mamfakinch , told Bitcoin Magazine.The outlet employed help Citizen Lab dismantle virus trace back Hacking Team source , though damage already done time consulted help. “ Moroccan activists suffer tremendously government surveillance provides , former ones like seen like . From physical threats family threats , even worse threats fellow activists part human rights digital rights effort Morocco , ” said.Hacking Team repeatedly refused disclose clients , internal emails betray , often , ties human rights abuses oppressive regimes unearthed international media , always tried mitigate scrutiny severity ensuing bad press.In June 2014 , U.N. panel inquired Hacking Team ’ business Sudan violating sanctions regarding weapons exports country . The U.N. considered Hacking Team ’ software weapon sorts , something Russo refutes internal emails also emphasizing team wants keep name clear records regarding investigation. “ It looks like focus trace every single armament , ” wrote Russo . “ We absolutely need avoid mentioned documents. ” Why Coinbase ( We ) Should CareThe U.N. investigative panel would mark beginning Hacking Team ’ unraveling . By March 2016 , Italian government revoked Hacking Team ’ export license Italian PhD student murdered Cairo , Egypt . Hacking Team ’ software allegedly involved crime . With company ’ revenue streams severely restricted , Hacking Team last financial leg.Conveniently , Neutrino founded year Italian officials revoked Hacking Team ’ export license , “ obviously around time would desperate money needing start fresh somehow , ” Janine , member crypto podcast Block Digest initially raised alarm Hacking Team Neutrino ’ ties , told Bitcoin Magazine.Bitcoin Magazine spoke Janine learn possible ramifications acquisition . In addition work Block Digest , Janine consistent reliable whistleblower industry developments could indicate privacy threats . In past , also helped dissect community concerns surrounding privacy implications Bitfury ’ Peach Lightning suite.As Bitfury situation , Janine covered every angle Neutrino Hacking Team ’ shared past Twitter , helped Block Digest produce two-hour segment subject , well . Since Neutrino acquired Coinbase , team financially secure . Furthermore , part deal , continue act autonomously Coinbase ’ London office . The exchange framed buyout means outfit proper tools remain KYC- AML-compliant regulators . Janine points company likely make use XFlow nSight end , though ’ also worried Neutrino ’ technology come serious privacy trade-offs nSight ’ base functionality. “ The chain analysis stuff really interesting ; much access Coinbase give Neutrino , ” told Bitcoin Magazine.More specifically , expressed concern Money Module , Hacking Team software allows user access devices private keys . Janine also suspicious backdoors Hacking Team coded software : “ They likely access whatever data government clients collecting targets. ” If Coinbase forks much data Neutrino transaction analysis , backdoor software exists tandem Money Module , could spell disaster user privacy private key security.That backdoor may exist alongside vehicle stealing user funds disturbing — even disturbing , Janine critics suggested , Coinbase ’ ability overlook history unethical business practices Neutrino ’ team.When Bitcoin Magazine reached Coinbase ask acquisition plans use Neutrino , exchange sent back general statement , indicating aware ’ condone Hacking Team ’ practices . But past behavior enough Coinbase distance team whose expertise line vision . Zineb , also crypto enthusiast , told us ’ disheartening see privacy-compromising autocratic software eke way cryptocurrency space . You expect legacy tech industry , expressed , ’ expect industry whose tenets rest privacy , freedom censorship resistance. “ To Coinbase acquire anything run anyone ever associated Hacking Team alarming , ” said . “ Perhaps Coinbase clueless WHY ’ important protect [ virtues ] , I ’ . When banks freeze easily hand private financial information dissidents autocratic countries , ’ system like [ Bitcoin ] needed. “ They say protect user data . But possibly trust engaged appalling actions would somehow Coinbase user data privacy ’ best interest heart ? I ’ say much others I speak : I ’ using tools future , shame allowing Hacking Team people continue thrive . `` Coinbase ’ Director Institutional Sales , Christine Sandler , said interview last week , part , exchange acquired controversial software firm Neutrino prior blockchain analysis providers selling customer data. “ The compelling reason making acquisition Neutrino industry leading , best class technology . It important us migrate away current providers . They selling client data outside sources compelling us get control proprietary technology could leverage keep data safe protect clients , ” Sandler said interview Cheddar.In current privacy policy , Coinbase asserts shares customer information third parties fraud prevention legal compliance well “ bill collection , marketing , technology services. ” The active policy says personally never sell client information , transaction personal , third parties.Sandler ’ slip tells another tale . If statement true , Coinbase may inadvertently violated terms use . Coinbase users believed data shared regulatory purpose , monetized , Jill Carlson points Twitter : “ Selling data different collecting regulatory purposes . I consented Coinbase collecting data KYC/AML purposes . I knowingly consent Coinbase collecting data sell parties. ” Seeing prior providers breached trust , Coinbase ’ acquisition Neutrino makes sense ; old ( hopefully trustworthy ) new . In one news blurbs , cryptocurrency media platform Messari indicates purchase likely made minimize counterpart risk bringing analysis services house . Most exchanges use providers , source told Messari , going new kid block likely way Coinbase could make sure provider would ’ told. “ A source knowledge situation explained n't much choice Coinbase , almost regulated crypto exchanges likely use one several large blockchain analytics tools , including industry leaders Elliptic Chainalysis . The source said firms moved ‘ give-get ’ data model , Coinbase would permitted use service return providing data . Coinbase ‘ brought capability house ’ situation using 3rd party tool making better ’ surveillance tech. ” Still , Coinbase looking team could trust , Neutrino ’ past far trustworthy . The company ’ three executives used run business called Hacking Team , sold surveillance malware authoritarian regimes around world precipitated , among human rights abuses , monitoring , imprisonment death journalists regime dissidents.Neutrino ’ past Coinbase embroiled intense community scrutiny , collective ire manifested # DeleteCoinbase campaign Twitter.Coinbase claims Neutrino offer best-in-class software , hence ’ best fit AML/KYC compliance business-related transaction analysis . But even disregarding questions trust Neutrino ’ past may muster , company ’ pedigree might even up-to-snuff.Jesse Powell , CEO Kraken exchange , said Neutrino disqualified “ due [ ] risks ” compliance evaluation . Even without risk , came last actual product compared four providers. “ I asked Compliance team thought Neutrino , ” Powell tweeted . “ Fortunately , 'd completed evaluation . Neutrino came last place product ( 5 ) disqualified anyway due risks . However , factors important M & A : cost , culture fit. ” BHB Network head Giacomo Zucco told Bitcoin Magazine company gave negative evaluation Neutrino ’ services similar reasons Kraken ’ compliance review raised red flags . Zucco told Bitcoin Magazine , BHB Network evaluated live demo Neutrino ’ blockchain analysis technology client February 2017 , company refused let BHB test tech using addresses.The demo conducted using “ pre-defined addresses , ” said , team argued ’ open source software technology “ secret ” algorithm ’ give away. “ We n't actually get far . After demo , I doubts ‘ secret source ’ claims . Then googled names enough tell client pass , ” Zucco told Bitcoin Magazine.At time publication , Coinbase returned Bitcoin Magazine ’ request comment.After week community discontent , cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase decided sever business relationship Neutrino employees previously worked notorious Italian malware/software provider Hacking Team.Blaming “ gap [ Coinbase ’ ] diligence process , ” CEO Brian Armstrong writes Medium post Coinbase “ properly evaluate everything perspective mission values crypto company. ” Last week , Neutrino ’ link Hacking Team came light thanks Twitter commentators like Block Digest ’ “ Janine. ” At least three individuals Neutrino ’ core team ( CEO Giancarlo Russo , CRO Marco Valleri CTO Alberto Ornaghi ) principal employees Hacking Team , well Luca Guerre , intern-turned-software-engineer company.Coinbase disclose team members would let go , ’ information indicate many Neutrino employees might affected severance . Armstrong also offered timeline post departures would take place.Disbanded 2016 , Hacking Team made headlines business ’ zenith selling surveillance malware authoritarian governments . Their software ’ use implicated inumerable privacy human rights abuses , including death imprisonment journalists civil rights activists.News Hacking Team ’ abuses spread like wildfire community , part stoked tenacious media coverage social media backlash , culminating # DeleteCoinbase campaign.And apparently , heat enough Coinbase decide dissolve connections people previously associated Hacking Team.Previously , exchange defended acquisition blanket statement sent press . Coinbase stated “ condone defend actions Hacking Team , ” “ important [ ] bring [ blockchain analysis services ] in-house fully control protect customers ' data , Neutrino ’ technology best encountered space achieve goal. ” A days response situation , Coinbase ’ Director Institutional Sales , Christine Sandler , would tell Cheddar need bring services in-house protect data due former blockchain analysis providers monetizing user data , something Coinbase ’ privacy policy.In post , Armstrong mentions Neutrino also acquired old providers ’ support assets [ exchange ] wanted [ ] platform , ” “ examined players , found Neutrino best technology area , decided acquire them. ” Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase purchased controversial Italian software services provider Neutrino $ 13.5 million ( €12 million ) , copy legal document dated February 15 , 2019 , shared Bitcoin Magazine reveals . The hard numbers acquisition previously unknown.The document leak comes week turbulent developments following February 19 acquisition . Community members , namely Block Digest podcast member Janine , began raise ethical concerns stemming company ’ shared past Hacking Team , Italian , man-in-the-middle software provider whose malware spyware linked human rights privacy abuses around globe.This revelation invoked strong reactions among community members , eventually manifesting # DeleteCoinbase movement . Coinbase ultimately buckled mounting pressure , announcing would parting ways Neutrino staff ties Hacking Team . Per deal , Neutrino would “ continue operate standalone business based [ Coinbase ’ ] London office , ” meaning CRO Marco Valleri , CTO Alberto Ornaghi CEO Giancarlo Russo originally slated stay executives severance.Marco Valleri Alberto Ornaghi founders Hacking Team , Neutrino ’ CEO , Giancarlo Russo , joined Hacking Team 2004 COO .

In conversation Bitcoin Magazine , Samourai ’ lead developer , known simply “ TD , ” gave rundown Tor integration . He explained using Tor integration creating new wallet shield user ’ identity beyond fact required provide personal information . With Tor , Samourai ’ servers able see user ’ IP address connect API , Bitcoin addresses , thus protecting one piece information could tie wallet real-world identity.He also noted Tor-enabled connectivity paves way Samourai ’ forthcoming Whirlpool mixing services full-node Dojo offering , two privacy-enhancing features. “ Our users requesting tighter Tor integration time , ” TD explained . “ It prerequisite rolling Whirlpool Dojo. ” Whirlpool Samourai ’ implementation ZeroLink , coin-mixing protocol anticipated since 2017 . ZeroLink ’ protocol demands use Tor , enabling Whirlpool break chain analysis incoming outgoing coins . This shuffling helps ensure privacy secure anonymity origin source outgoing transaction.Samourai ’ wallet-specific full node , Dojo , tailor-made run Tor-only connection .

VeriBlock allows blockchain inherit full proof-of-work security Bitcoin using novel consensus protocol — proof proof — records snapshots given blockchain embeds ( aggregated form ) Bitcoin transactions , allowing former inherit latter ’ security characteristics.These snapshots automatically referenced protocol event 51-percent attack determine correct chain . The presence conflicting snapshots particular “ altchain ” triggers early attack detection ( EAD ) metrics , warns users potential rewrite confirm transaction updates transaction safe accept.VeriBlock uses OP_RETURN — type bitcoin transaction used embedding data blockchain . It used anything proving existence data specific point time ( proof existence ) issuing new assets , top Bitcoin blockchain. “ A ‘ regular ’ Bitcoin transaction one carrying VeriBlock publication need mutually exclusive , ” VeriBlock CTO Max Sanchez said . “ It would relatively simple engineering matter add option Bitcoin wallet said ‘ Sending BTC ? Secure crypto-ecosystem VeriBlock subsidize BTC transaction fee. ’ ” Does VeriBlock Create Problems Bitcoin ? There estimates percentage Bitcoin blockspace used VeriBlock range 20 percent network high 45 percent . This may raise concerns VeriBlock affect network. “ This widely reported right VeriBlock testnet phased , ” Sanchez said . “ However , effects proof proof Bitcoin network actually small … As demand bitcoin transactions increases users willing bid higher fees , amount space VeriBlock consumes Bitcoin shrink — two economic forces result equilibrium. ” Sanchez also noted VeriBlock ’ solution offers security regardless Bitcoin ’ transaction frequency given time. “ The natural ebb-and-flow VeriBlock transaction volume Bitcoin affect security characteristics VeriBlock VeriBlock-secured altchains , adversely affect Bitcoin , ” said.Jameson Lopp , CTO Casa , observing VeriBlock ’ activity Bitcoin ’ testnet year.During episode HSHR8 podcast March 20 , 2019 , Lopp said ’ see VeriBlock venture attack Bitcoin network , might , wondered economics spending millions fees provide security. “ If ’ paying fees put blockchain convince miners put , might economic rationality , ” said . Lopp also noted see “ value data anchor ” Bitcoin. “ We believe VeriBlock elegantly expands Bitcoin ’ usefulness way ’ result burden network , ” VeriBlock CEO Justin Fisher told Bitcoin Magazine . “ It drives demand Bitcoin also , way , helps make Bitcoin secure maximizing utility derived Bitcoin ’ energy consumption. ” In announcement March 25 , 2019 , Matt Roszak , Bloq co-founder ; Anthony Di Iorio , founder CEO Decentral ; Bill Shihara , co-founder CEO Bittrex , commended VeriBlock innovative new protocol , expecting add new level security blockchain ecosystem . `` Bloq proud part journey VeriBlock past two years — especially technology helps blockchain project thrive benefit security Bitcoin provides , ” Roszak wrote company blog . “ As multi-chain , multi-network , multi-token world emerges , confident VeriBlock continue play vital role security root new frontier . `` The vice president crypto exchange BitBuy , Jordan Anderson , also praised solution interview Bitcoin Magazine. “ VeriBlock excellent example proof-of-proof initiative ensure altcoins susceptible 51-percent attack , ” said . “ VeriBlock promote security stability within altcoin ecosystem , provide greater confidence consumers looking participate. ” Meanwhile , long-time bitcoin core developer Peter Todd apprehensive , explaining needed time look actual implementation VeriBlock project. “ The general idea piggybacking existing consensus system good one , ” said . “ But VeriBlock unusually complex variant idea , I 'm confident given I 've seen white paper secure. ” The Chinese security service provider 360 Security issued warning large number crypto exchanges targeted North Korean hacker group Lazarus number still rising recent hacks crypto exchanges DragonEx , Etbox BiKi.360 Core Security found Lazarus , also known ATP-C-26 group , used software called “ Worldbit-bot ” carry active attacks . The crypto exchange DragonEx fell victim March 24 , 2019 , leading loss $ 7.09 million , according 360 Security report.The analysis 360 Advanced Threat Response Team detailed attacking group registered two domains , wb-invest.net wb-bot.org , last October preparation attacks . Then faked cryptocurrency trading software Worldbit-bot based open-sourced “ Qt Bitcoin Trader , ” embedded malicious code . The malicious software camouflaged within regular automated crypto trading platform domains wb-invest.net wb-bot.org , kept normal operation half year . The attackers targeted large number internal staff cryptocurrency exchanges software promotion . The latest phishing attacks took place January March 2019.According China-based JohnWick Security , assisting DragonEx investigating hacking incident , customer service staff DragonEx appear opened installation package named wbbot.dmg unknown source . Analysis indicates backdoor embedded installation package , hackers acquired internal staff ’ authorization obtained wallet private key.The “ Worldbit-bot ” software operates much manner , faked crypto trading software “ Celas Trade Pro , ” detected team 360 Security last August . Users Bitfinex , Bitstamp , Bitmarket , BTCChina , GOC.io , Indacoin , OKCoin , WEX Y0bit susceptible threat time.First , process information collected encrypted.System information collected , Malicious codes executed decrypted file execution . The security company recommending crypto exchanges lookout warning signs abnormal exchange earnings , tampered addresses cold hot wallets , large sum transfers multiple account logins coin withdrawal.Lazarus infamous hacking group backed North Korea . According research , group ’ earliest attack may associated “ Operation Flame , ” large-scale DDOS attack South Korean government website 2007 . Lazarus also alleged group behind Sony Pictures hacking incident 2014 , Bank Bangladesh data breach 2016 “ Wannacry ” ransomware attack swept across globe 2017 . Since 2017 , group expanding targets attack , increasingly aiming variety economic interests . In earlier attacks , group mainly targeted banking systems traditional financial institutions . Now , begun attack global cryptocurrency businesses individuals.As previously reported , Lazarus purportedly responsible $ 571 million $ 882 million cryptocurrency stolen exchanges 2017 2018 , almost 65 percent total amount . Out 14 exchange attacks , five attributed group , including industry record-breaking $ 532 million NEM hack Japan ’ Coincheck.Electrum servers still sustained Denial-of-Service ( DoS ) attack . The wallet developers announced issue April 7 , 2018.In correspondence Bitcoin Magazine , Electrum developer Thomas Voegtlin speculated attack may form retaliation phishing attacker targeting Electrum recent weeks . Since phishing attacks thwarted , attacker could resorting DoS attacks instead , simply frustrate Electrum developers users . Voegtlin pointed , case , behavior “ rational ” given incumbent waste attacker ’ resources.A DoS attack fairly straightforward means disrupting server activity , usually carried flooding server frivolous requests variety different sources overwhelm processing capacity . Attacks nature carried individual number actors , key method attack simply overwhelm server itself.When DoS attack targets light wallet Electrum , exploits fact users need run nodes connect directly Bitcoin network , instead , connect Electrum servers . By overwhelming servers DoS attacks , wallets become less usable , takes find working server.It ’ also possible DoS carried person ( group ) behind phishing attacks hopes DoS attack increase chance phishing attack still succeed way . As part phishing scam , users would connect fraudulent servers . These fraudulent servers would send users phony message asking update new version Electrum , sending link download coin-stealing malware . Voegtlin speculated , adding DoS attack , attacker may hoping overwhelm legitimate servers Electrum , making likely users inadvertently connect malicious servers.Voegtlin suggested phishing attack unlikely succeed , however : First , phishing attack works non-updated Electrum clients , second , works clients connect malicious servers . Since clients always connect 10 servers , unlikely , said . If even one servers non-fraudulent , phishing attempt fail.According Voegtlin , ETA total fix DoS attacks , already countered . `` We spawned servers found blacklist botnet IP addresses , ” said . “ That means servers usable . '' Electrum also plans ban data-heavy clients way curtailing processing overload.Updated versions Electrum risk phishing malware , affected DoS attack.For , Electrum suggests users `` disable auto-connect select server manually . '' Simply waiting short often trick well. “ Give time ; sometimes connects minutes , ” Voegtlin added . He also advises users stay server works switch.Last month , South Korean exchange Bithumb lost $ 13 million worth cryptocurrency hackers . While initially appeared unlikely funds would ever recovered , recent police raid conducted South Korea giving hope money may returned.Per reports local news outlet , Cyber ​​Investigation Department South Korea ’ National Police Agency seized external server believes associated attack Bithumb . While first theft believed inside job evidence external hacker found , upon closer inspection police found proof external server IP address suspected involved . That server found seized law enforcement officials.Details still sketchy culprits attack managed steal millions dollars ’ worth cryptocurrency , including 3 million EOS tokens . Local officials believe details may come light police analysts search hard drive seized server find evidence linked person group behind crime.However , according officials involved , ’ going easy . Even though blockchain transactions transparent , one Korean official noted challenging track crime perpetrator used multiple paths mask actions.It ’ help , globally , many police departments unequipped deal cryptocurrency hacks police officers deep understanding blockchain technology works.If police able determine committed attack zero perpetrator ’ exact location , might able make arrest recover lost funds.The upside hack funds stolen belonged exchange , customers , retail investors lose coins . Last year , Bithumb suffered major security breach , saw hackers steal $ 30 million worth cryptocurrencies belonging users wallets .\n"
