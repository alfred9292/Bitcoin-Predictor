2019/4/9,Bitcoin mining ban considered by China's economic planner,"Bitcoin creation has joined a list of activities facing a ban in China.

A notice published online in Mandarin by the country's economic planning agency added ""virtual currency mining activities [including] the production process of Bitcoin"" to a list of industries that could be shut down.

The suggestion is that the power consumed by the industry contributes to pollution and wastes resources.

The Chinese public has been invited to comment until 7 May.

The National Development and Reform Commission has not said when the suggested ban might be introduced.

Puzzle prizes
Bitcoin mining involves carrying out computer processor-intensive tasks to solve complicated mathematical problems in order to verify cryptocurrency transactions.

As an incentive to take part, the owners of the equipment that is first to solve a puzzle are rewarded with a batch of newly created bitcoins.

The complexity of the tasks is adjusted to ensure each block of transactions is processed on a regular basis - approximately once every 10 minutes on average. As a consequence, the more computers that compete, the harder the puzzles are made, which in turn means a greater amount of electricity is required to power them.

Some of the world's biggest cryptocurrency mining operations - known as farms - are based in China.

Concerns about them have previously been raised in the country's state-controlled media.

The Xinhua news agency reported in October about a study that suggested related carbon dioxide emissions could feed into global warming, and increase temperatures by two degrees Celsius as soon as 2033.

The news service has also reported on hundreds of mining computers being seized by the authorities following claims they were responsible for abnormal electricity consumption, threatening the smooth running of local power grids.

Last year, one of the country's regulators - the Leading Group of Internet Financial Risks Remediation - called on local governments to direct mining companies to make an ""orderly exit"" from the market.

Chinese regulators have also taken other action against the industry, closing Bitcoin exchanges and banning initial coin offerings (ICOs) as part of a digital currency crackdown in 2017.
However, the FCA concluded that - with relatively small sums involved - the overall scale of harm from volatility in value might not have been as high as previously feared.

'Wild West'
Owing to the lack of regulation, there is no compensation or protection for investors if things go wrong.

Last year, the Treasury Committee of MPs said that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were a ""Wild West industry"" which needed to be regulated to protect investors.

It said that risks of hacking and money-laundering were also concerns.

CryptoUK, which was set up last year as a self-regulatory body for the crypto-currency industry, agreed that there should be official oversight.

""CryptoUK has consistently argued that cryptocurrency investment should be regulated in the UK, to provide greater certainty and to adequately protect consumers,"" said Iqbal Gandham, who chairs the group.

""We are pleased that the government agrees with our approach, and are actively working alongside the FCA and Treasury to help deliver a proportionate and well-designed UK regulatory regime which matches the best of other jurisdictions across the globe.""
The National Development and Reform Commission's intervention appears to have had little effect on the value of Bitcoin.

Its notice was published on Monday, since when one bitcoin has continued to trade for above $5,000 (?3,820) - its highest level since November 2018.",BBC,
2019/3/7,Bitcoin: Crypto investors 'think they can get rich quick',"Investors influenced by friends and social media celebrities are buying Bitcoin and other cryptoassets in an attempt to ""get rich quick"".

But many are putting in their money, with no protection against losses, without fully understanding what they are doing.

The findings are in research published by the Financial Conduct Authority.

Huge volatility has led to warnings about investing in crypto. One industry group has called for regulation.   A heavily-promoted industry in cryptoassets has built up in recent years, with Bitcoin the most popular.

Despite the hype, very few people actually put their money into this kind of unregulated investment, according to the Financial Conduct Authority's research. Its findings suggested:

Only 3% of those asked in the FCA's survey had ever bought cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin
Those who do buy cryptocurrency tend to spend less than ?200
Just one in 100 people who have not done so said they would in the future
Cryptocurrency is primarily understood by men aged 20 to 44, but 73% of all those asked said they could not define it
""Despite this lack of understanding, the cryptoasset owners interviewed were often looking for ways to 'get rich quick' citing friends, acquaintances and social media influencers as key motivations for buying cryptoassets,"" the FCA said.

Huge volatility in these investments have led to warnings across the world of the risks involved.

""Cryptoassets are complex, volatile products - consumers investing in them should be prepared to lose all of their money,"" said Christopher Woolard, of the FCA.However, the FCA concluded that - with relatively small sums involved - the overall scale of harm from volatility in value might not have been as high as previously feared.

2019/1/17,Fake BBC News page used to promote Bitcoin-themed scheme,"An investment scheme is using a fake BBC News webpage to convince members of the public to hand over funds.

The spoof page references a Bitcoin-themed documentary broadcast by Panorama last year, but links on the page direct visitors to a site promising to make them a millionaire.

Reports indicate that the fake page is being spread via emails sent from hacked accounts.

A spokesman for the BBC said it is looking into how best to respond.

The Financial Conduct Authority has previously issued a warning about an earlier scheme run under the same Bitcoin Trader branding that features in the latest effort.

This is not the first time an attempt has been made to link the brand to the BBC.

Last year, adverts appeared on social media and elsewhere falsely claiming that a trading platform operating under the same name had been backed by several of Dragons' Den's stars.

Two of the show's entrepreneurs - Deborah Meaden and Peter Jones - subsequently issued denials.

Ads also claimed that Lord Alan Sugar had quit The Apprentice to help promote its software, leading the businessman to tweet that he had contacted the police. In addition, the former BBC journalist Martin Lewis - who now runs the MoneySavingExpert site - launched legal action against Facebook after it failed to remove fake ads suggesting he was also involved.

And Sir Richard Branson has also warned that fake CNN news pages had been created to make it seem that he had endorsed a Bitcoin Trader-branded scheme.It is not, however, clear whether the people behind the effort are the same as before.

Countdown timer
The fake BBC News page contains a lengthy article describing an ""underground banking system"" that allows investors to turn small deposits into ""a fortune"".

It presents a case study of one individual who supposedly saw an investment of less than ?300 grow into nearly ?900,000.

At the bottom of the page, a countdown clock indicates that there is little time remaining to enrol in the venture.

City of London Police's cyber-crime team has previously warned users against this tactic.

""Always be wary if you're pressured to invest quickly or promised returns that sound too good to be true,"" it said when it discussed the con last April.

One of the indications the latest bogus webpage is fake is its address, which does not correspond to the bbc.co.uk or bbc.com domains used by the broadcaster.

One cyber-security expert said members of the public who receive emails urging them to click any link with an unusual address should in general be cautious of doing so.

""If you are suspicious of any email, search for the page or website in Google rather than clicking the link,"" suggested Lisa Forte, from Red Goat Cyber Security.

""And if you receive the email at work, let your IT team know so they can deal with it appropriately.""",BBC,
2018/11/19,"Bitcoin falls below $5,000","The value of Bitcoin has fallen below $5,000 (?3,889) for the first time since October 2017.

The fall brought the total value of all Bitcoin in existence to below $87bn.

On Thursday, 15 November, Bitcoin Cash - an offshoot of Bitcoin - split into two different crypto-currencies, which are now in competition with each other.

And some observers have blamed this for creating turmoil in the crypto-currency markets, with many of the digital assets experiencing falls.

Bitcoin exchange Kraken said in a blog post that it regarded one of the two new Bitcoin Cash crypto-currencies - Bitcoin SV - as ""an extremely risky investment"".

Bitcoin is a notoriously volatile crypto-currency.

At its peak, in November 2017, it briefly hit $19,783 - which means the price has fallen by about 75%.Analysis: Rory Cellan-Jones, Technology correspondent
After the excitements of last year when the price soared to nearly $20,000 and then tumbled, Bitcoin has been rather dull and stable for much of 2018, settling between $6,000 and $7,000.

Sceptics like the economist Nouriel Roubini have predicted its demise, while the ""hodlers"" - those who promise to hold it come what may - remained confident it was heading ""to the moon"" where they would drive their ""lambos"". (That's- Lamborghinis for the uninitiated.)

Now it is tumbling again and while it is never safe to ascribe any one cause to a market movement, bitter rifts in the community around a Bitcoin variant appear to be to blame.

Bitcoin Cash split off from Bitcoin last year after a dispute about its direction and split again a few days ago in another so-called hard fork.

Its value has dropped by almost 50% over the last week. It's confusing but think of the People's Front of Judea versus the Judean People's Front and you will get the picture.

The result is gloom right across the cryptocurrency sector with its many altcoins. We were told that the fact that there was a strict limit of 21 million bitcoins which could be mined guaranteed that this would be a strong and stable currency.

What nobody seemed to reckon with was that if you could start one cryptocurrency you could start dozens and chaos might then ensue.",,
2019/3/19,Why are Venezuelans seeking refuge in crypto-currencies?,"Crypto-currencies have faced a lot of criticism since Bitcoin first came on the scene 10 years ago. But for one group of people, they're proving very useful.

Venezuela has seen its currency rendered practically valueless after suffering one of the worst periods of hyperinflation since World War Two.

A cup of coffee now costs 2,800 bolivars (21p; 28 cents), up from 0.75 bolivars 12 months ago - an increase of 373,233%, according to Bloomberg data. And that's after a 2018 devaluation that knocked five zeros off the currency.

More than three million Venezuelans have left the country, as essential goods such as toilet paper and medicine have become unaffordable and crime has soared.

As a result, many are turning to digital assets such as Bitcoin as an alternative to the Venezuelan bolivar.

And given how volatile Bitcoin is - its value has plunged from nearly ?15,000 in 2017 to less than ?3,000 now - it's an indication of just how desperate people have become.Even the government has launched its own crypto-currency, the Petro, supposedly backed by oil, to provide a solution to the economic crisis.But critics say it is a sham and there is no evidence of anyone using it.

Gold, rabbits and crypto: Venezuela's strange economic plans
Eli Meregote, 28, has been using Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies as a way of sending money home from Colombia where he now lives and works, avoiding the fees usually associated with money transfer services such as Western Union.

""I first discovered crypto in 2017 when I lost my job in Venezuela,"" the CCTV technician says. ""Even if I had my job, it would've been useless anyway, because the minimum wage was $4 a month.""

Cryptos offered him ""total control"" of his money ""without banks or third parties"", he says. ""With Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies, I can send money home faster and without obstacles.""Bitcoin was designed to be a global, digital currency that governments and banks couldn't interfere with. Like many other crypto-currencies it works by recording all transactions permanently on a distributed ledger called the blockchain.

Critics say Bitcoin and other cryptos - there are more than 1,600 globally - are unstable, use too much energy, and are used by money launderers or those wanting to buy illicit goods on the web.

But for Venezuelans, storing their money in a digital wallet in the form of Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dash or any of the others, is still a better option than holding on to the national currency.

Adoption has rocketed, with trading volumes on Localbitcoins.com - a person-to-person Bitcoin trading platform - rivalling those of the US.Although trading volumes dipped in March due to a power cut that plunged the country into darkness for days, February saw trading levels reach ?6.84m ($8.76m) per week and nearly ?1m per day, according to crypto-currency data tracker Coin Dance.

In pictures: Seeking water amid power cut
""Many Venezuelans are using Bitcoin to convert their bolivars, which are being permanently devalued by hyperinflation, to keep something of value,"" says economist Asdrubal Oliveros of Caracas-based consultancy Econanalitica.

""It is practically a vehicle for buying foreign currency and to conserve value, as it is relatively easy and you can keep small amounts which do not involve large investments.""Mr Oliveros points out that in Venezuela many people work as freelancers, receiving their pay in bitcoin since in most cases they do not have accounts abroad that allow them to make transfers in dollars.

""Receiving payments in bolivars does not make much sense,"" he says.

Matt Aaron, who manages the Venezuela arm of Bitcoin.com, the crypto-currency news and trading platform, says: ""We pay our team members in Caracas in Bitcoin Cash. Transactions are instant and cost less than a cent to make.""

Ricardo Carrasco, 29, an IT engineer who is paid in bitcoin, is a fan of the crypto-currency.

""It has given me access to the financial world outside Venezuela,"" he says. ""We are not free to exchange our currency for US dollars or any other currency. We don't have access to the banking services of the world, so crypto allows you to bypass those barriers.""
Mr Carrasco sells small amounts of Bitcoin on Localbitcoins.com and other exchanges, and receives money in bolivars to his Venezuelan account. He is then able to buy goods with his card as and when he needs to.

""It is a pretty simple, straightforward process,"" he says.

But Venezuela's government is intervening, recently launching a remittance service that caps the amount of crypto-currency someone inside the country can receive. It has started earning commissions from the transactions.One thing is certain: despite the Bitcoin crash and loss in value of other crypto-currencies, Venezuelans have more interest in digital assets than ever before.

In the Colombian border town of Cucuta, which sees tens of thousands of fleeing Venezuelans arrive every day, a new crypto-currency cash machine (ATM) was opened in March.

It is designed to make carrying funds safer and more convenient.""With the ATM, Venezuelans can receive bitcoin from anywhere in the world and cash out in Colombian pesos right away,"" says Matias Goldenh?rn from Athena, the company that installed the machine.

""A Venezuelan family of four, getting on a bus in Cucuta to emigrate to Argentina, was carrying all their life savings in cash on their 14-day bus journey,"" he recalls.

""They just exchanged all the money into bitcoin and, once they arrived at their final destination, sold the crypto for the local currency, hence not risking travelling with the money on them.

""It made life a lot easier for them.""

At least there is one country in the world where Bitcoin is serving a practical value for ordinary citizens rather than speculators.",,
2019/4/2,TalkTalk hacker claimed he would be a 'millionaire',"heard.

Elliott Gunton, 19, of Sprowston, near Norwich, made the claim to a police officer and said he was share dealing.

The equivalent of more than ?200,000 was found in Mr Gunton's Bitcoin account, Norwich Crown Court heard.

Mr Gunton has denied five charges, including computer misuse offences and money laundering.

The court heard Mr Gunton was found guilty of hacking the telecommunications firm when he was 16.

'Wiped history'
Det Con Jamie Hollis told the court Mr Gunton, of Mounteney Close, had been put under a five-year order sexual harm prevention order which restricted his use of computers.

When police officers took his computer for an inspection during a six-monthly check under the terms of the order they found evidence he had used a programme to wipe its history, the court heard.

Det Con Hollis said before taking the computer he had asked Mr Gunton if he was looking for work.

""He said he was involved in stocks and shares and was adamant he would be millionaire in three years,"" Det Con Hollis said.

Mr Gunton is charged with two counts under the Computer Misuse Act 1990, including supplying profile user names and email accounts believing they were likely to be used to commit or assist the commission of offence.

He has also been accused of money laundering involving crypto-currency under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, and faces a charge of breaching a sexual harm prevention order.",,
2018/11/9,Man sent letter bomb to Bitcoin firm 'over password reset',"A man has been jailed for sending a ""potentially lethal homemade bomb"" to a Bitcoin firm in London - after it refused to reset his password for him.

The Met Police, which investigated the case, said detectives could ""only identify one possible reason"" for the Swedish national's actions.

He had emailed the company, Cryptopay, in August 2017, to ask that he be sent a new password.

Cryptopay, however, refused, saying this contravened its privacy policy.

Jermu Michael Salonen, 43, has been sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison at Stockholm District Court.

He faced a number of charges, including some for sending a white powder to Swedish lawmakers - among them, the prime minister - in 2017.

Eurostar resets customer passwords after hack attack
Lost passwords 'lead to lost savings'
Salonen had addressed a padded envelope containing the device to two Cryptopay employees.

It was delivered at some point in November 2017 to an office in Hackney, which had housed an accountancy firm previously used by Cryptopay.

Several months later, on 8 March 2018, a worker at the office began opening the package but did not continue when they became suspicious of what was inside.

""We are relieved that no one from The Accountancy Cloud team was hurt in this incident,"" a spokesman for Cryptopay told the BBC. ""None of our employees have ever worked at that address.""

""The vast majority of our employees work remotely across Europe, but we are implementing additional security measures to prevent any potential harm to our employees anyway.

""We are thankful for both British and Swedish police, who were able to investigate the case with outstanding professionalism.""

'Sheer luck'
""It was due to sheer luck that the recipient ripped opened the package in the middle rather than using the envelope flap which would have activated the device,"" said Commander Clarke Jarrett at the Met Police Counter Terrorism Command.Banks are not allowed to open accounts for people who are known to dealing in any virtual currency, which means that the population cannot easily convert Bitcoin payments into cash or mobile money.

""Crypto-currencies can facilitate and ensure that you do an unlimited number of transactions, however the volatility, lack of control and the non-acceptability of crypto-currencies across different jurisdictions impairs what you'd expect a currency to do,"" economist and policy expert Vincent Kimosop told the BBC.

The Blockchain Association of Kenya (BAK) disagrees with this way of thinking, and it is actively working to educate the country on the benefits of using crypto-currencies and blockchain.

The non-profit body says that using virtual currencies can greatly reduce the cost of transactions, and enable people without bank accounts to quickly make and receive payments.

According to BAK, there are many things Kenyans have realised they can use Bitcoin for - whether it is to pay merchants in China for goods, or to enable Nigerians to pay to send their children to school in Kenya, or to enable young African freelancers to be easily paid for their work online.

DNA found in the package did not match information on UK databases, so it was analysed by Interpol.

""Through these inquiries, it was identified that the DNA matched those of Salonen, who was known to Swedish authorities,"" the Met says.",,
2019/2/22,Crypto-currencies gaining popularity in Kenya,"Interest in virtual currencies is rising across the African continent, especially in Kenya, Africa's Silicon Valley.

Despite warnings from Kenya's central bank about the volatility of crypto-currencies, some businesses in Nairobi are now accepting Bitcoin payments.

The total number of Bitcoin transactions in Kenya are estimated to be worth over $1.5m, according to the Blockchain Association of Kenya.

But can the technology really take off?

Crypto-currencies are virtual money that can be used to pay for things in the real world, such as a hotel room, food or even a house.

Digital tokens are held in online wallets, and can be sent anonymously between users.

Crypto-currencies run on a technology called blockchain - a ledger of blocks of information, such as transactions or agreements, that are stored across a network of computers.

The information is stored chronologically and is designed to be de-centralised and tamper-proof.

While this provides security, it also means there is no oversight from a central authority such as a bank or a government.

The first-ever blockchain-backed currency developed was Bitcoin, and it continues to be the most widely-used globally.

At the moment, the crypto-currencies Bitcoin, Dash and Lisk are used in Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and Zimbabwe.

Blockchain is also being implemented by start-ups and tech conglomerates alike in Kenya to help solve problems, such as IBM's platform to help small businesses to prove their creditworthiness for loans.

Preventing theft
Tony Mwongera, the chief executive of Healthland Spa in Nairobi, began accepting Bitcoin payments in 2018.

''I decided to adopt the use of crypto-currencies because there was so much theft in my business,"" he told the BBC.

""So I said, let me use a way that can be safe, secure and I can also embrace technology.""

Healthland Spa customers told the BBC that they like the convenience of using crypto-currencies to pay for purchases.

However, if you look at the total number of people in Kenya using virtual currencies today, it is still relatively small - only about 40,000 people have ever made a transaction using Bitcoin.

Part of the reason crypto-currency penetration isn't growing that much is because Kenya's central bank has forbidden banks from dealing in virtual currencies.",,
2017/12/1,US regulator approves Bitcoin trading,"Bitcoin has taken another step toward the financial mainstream, after a US regulator said it would let two traditional exchanges begin trading in Bitcoin-related financial contracts.

CME Group and CBOE Global Markets exchanges will offer investors Bitcoin futures from later this month.

The move sent the crypto-currency's price up, continuing its volatile week.

Bitcoin hit a record above $11,400 on Wednesday, but then lost 20% of its value in the following 24 hours.

What's behind the Bitcoin gold rush?

Bitcoin - risky bubble or the future?

The announcement from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that it will allow the futures to be traded was seen as a watershed moment for the currency.

It means that investors will be able to buy and sell ""future"" contracts in Bitcoins - an agreement to buy the crypto-currency, for example, in three months time at a certain price.

CME Group said trading would be available on its CME Globex electronic trading platform from 18 December.

To guard against volatility, CME and CBOE will put in place stricter than usual risk-management safeguards.

Bubble risk?
CME and CBOE have also agreed to enter into data-sharing agreements, particularly on the settlement process, so the CFTC can conduct its own surveillance on the new financial contracts.

Bitcoin's rapid rise from less than $800 in December last year to more than $11,000 this week on Coindesk has stoked fears that it is a pricing bubble that could leave recent investors worse-off.

JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon called Bitcoin a ""fraud"" at a conference in early September, while Goldman Sachs boss Lloyd Blankfein has questioned whether the crypto-currency is a currency at all, given its volatile pricing. It ""doesn't feel like a store of value,"" he has said.",,
2017/12/4,UK government mulls Bitcoin regulation,"Anti-money laundering regulations should be updated to include Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, the UK Treasury has said.

The Metropolitan Police says criminals are using crypto-currency cash machines to launder money in London.

The government's aim is part of a broader update to the EU rules which are under negotiation.

The update, revealed in Parliament last month, would mean that traders would no longer be able to operate anonymously.

'Self-police'
Bitcoin expert Dr Garrick Hileman, a research fellow at the University of Cambridge, said that in jurisdictions such as New York, crypto-currency is already subject to tighter regulation.

""I think these announcements have a powerful signalling effect and put the industry on notice that the 'cop on the beat' is concerned and watching crypto-currencies more closely now,"" he said of the Treasury news.

""This in turn will motivate companies to more effectively self-police bad actors.""

At a press briefing, Scotland Yard warned about the currencies' popularity among criminals.

""Organised criminal groups have been early adopters of crypto-currencies to evade traditional money laundering checks and statutory regulations,"" said Det Supt Nick Stevens, from the Serious and Organised Crime Command.

""Criminals have also used crypto-currencies to purchase illegal commodities on dark market sites with anonymity.""

A Treasury spokesman said that there were already ""clear tax rules"" for legitimate crypto-currency users.

""We also intend to update regulation to bring virtual currency exchange platforms into anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulation,"" he added.

Bitcoin billionaires
The value of Bitcoin has continued to climb after reaching a landmark value of $10,000 (?7,400) and at the time of writing was trading at more than $11,200.

Bank of England deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe has advised people to ""do their homework"" before investing.

""People need to be clear this is not an official currency. No central bank stands behind it, no government stands behind it,"" he told the BBC last week.

US twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss are reported to have become the world's first Bitcoin billionaires, having invested $11m in the currency in 2013.

That stake would now be worth $1.01bn, according to The Times.

The brothers settled a legal dispute with Facebook in 2011 after claiming that Mark Zuckerberg stole their idea for a social network.",,
2018/2/2,Bitcoin braces for worst week since 2013,"Digital currency Bitcoin has fallen 30% this week, leaving it on track for its worst week since April 2013.

On Friday the price fell below $7,910 on the Bitstamp exchange, a 12% fall on the day before, but recovered slightly.

But although it is far short of the $19,000 it reached in November 2017, it is still way above the $1,000 level at which it started trading last year.

The fall comes amid a number of recent incidents that appear to have shaken faith in cryptocurrencies.

On Friday, Japan's financial regulator carried out a surprise check on major Japanese exchange, Coincheck, which last week was subject to a security hack.

The regulator said it had asked the exchange to fix flaws in its computer networks well before last week's theft by hackers of $530m of digital money.

Also this week, Facebook said it would ban adverts for digital currencies.

What's the fuss about Bitcoin?
Other countries have already expressed concerns about such entities. China and South Korea have banned any new virtual currency launches and have been shutting down exchanges on which they are traded.

The UK's Financial Conduct Authority warned investors in September they could lose all their money if they buy digital currencies issued by firms, known as ""initial coin offerings"".

Bitcoins are created through a complex process known as ""mining"", and then monitored by a network of computers across the world.

However, like all currencies its value is determined by how much people are willing to buy and sell it for.

Last year, two of the world's largest commodity exchanges, the CBOE futures exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, both allowed trading in Bitcoin futures.

Bitcoin is the most widely traded cryptocurrency, but there are scores of others, the majority of which also fell on Friday, according to the Coinmarketcap.com price tracker.

The second and third largest virtual currencies, Ethereum and Ripple, plunged more than 20%, before a slight pull-back in the price.",,
2018/2/22,Bitcoin: MPs launch inquiry into digital currencies,"MPs have launched an inquiry into cryptocurrencies and the technology behind them.

The Treasury Committee said it wants to understand the risks and benefits of digital money following an explosion of interest - and investment - in them.

The MPs will cover the role of digital currencies in the UK, including the impact on consumers and businesses.

Although currencies such as Bitcoin have drawn criticism, the technology behind them has been praised.

Nicky Morgan, chair of the of the committee, said the MPs would look into how consumers and Britain's financial infrastructure might be better protected, without stifling innovation.

Last year's rapid rise, and subsequent fall, in the value of Bitcoin focussed attention on cryptocurrencies. They were variously dismissed as fraudulent, a ""Ponzi"" investment scam, and a vehicle for criminals and tax evaders.Bank of England governor Mark Carney said Bitcoin had failed as a currency, but that the underlying technology which records and verifies the chain of transactions might prove useful.

Warren Buffett, the venerated investor, said the speculative cryptocurrency craze ""will come to a bad end"".Ms Morgan said: ""People are becoming increasingly aware of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, but they may not be aware that they are currently unregulated in the UK, and that there is no protection for individual investors.

""The Treasury Committee will look at the potential risks that digital currencies could generate for consumers, businesses, and governments, including those relating to volatility, money laundering, and cyber-crime.

""We will also examine the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies and the technology underpinning them, how they can create innovative opportunities, and to what extent they could disrupt the economy and replace traditional means of payment.""

But she also wants to strike a balance between protection and regulation, and not hindering the blockchain technology behind cryptocurrencies. ""As part of the inquiry, we will explore how this can be achieved,"" she said.

The committee, which has yet to set a date for its first evidence session, will take evidence on key questions, including:

Are digital currencies ultimately capable of replacing traditional means of payment?
To what extent could digital currencies disrupt the economy and the workings of the public sector?
What risks and benefits could digital currencies generate for consumers, businesses and governments?
Could regulation benefit digital currency start-ups by improving consumer trust?
How are governments and regulators in other countries approaching digital currencies and what lessons can the UK learn from overseas?",,
2018/5/29,A new addiction: Could you be hooked on Bitcoin?,"Experts in gambling addictions have identified a new ticking time bomb.

The explosion of interest in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin has created a new kind of addiction.

A rehab clinic in the Scottish borders is now offering a treatment for digital money traders who cannot stop speculating within the unpredictable market.

The rise of Bitcoin has combined with advances in technology allowing anyone to trade online.

Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies are bought and sold like shares, and traded globally. Their value also fluctuates like shares.

Castle Craig Hospital in West Linton has been inundated with inquiries about helping people addicted to trading in the modern currency and is treating it in the same way as gambling addiction.

'Like a slot machine'
Michael Parsons is a Bitcoin expert.

He told BBC Scotland's Stephen Jardine Programme why this modern activity has become addictive: ""I think because Bitcoin entered the mainstream last year and it went up ten times in value, people have a fear of missing out and want to jump in.

""They are incorrectly looking at the historical rise of Bitcoin and think that will be repeated - which it may be or may not be - so they are buying purely on speculation and not on understanding.""He said the practice is based on hope - like putting money into a slot machine.

""Bitcoin has gone up ten times last year, over the last 12 months it's gone up 240%, in the last month it's gone down by 23% and today it went down almost 3% itself,"" he said.

""People are looking at the wild fluctuations and thinking they have to jump on the bandwagon and perhaps make some money out of it.""

What is cryptocurrency?
There are now thousands of different crypto-currencies, but Bitcoin is still the best-known.

Bitcoin has no notes or coins: it is digital and largely exists online and it is not issued by governments or traditional banks.

Bitcoins are created through a complex process known as ""mining"", and then monitored by a network of computers across the world.

It was reported in January 2018 that the total value of all cryptocurrencies was almost ?500bn

It is estimated there are between 13 and 28 million active users of cryptocurrencies in the world today.Its value is determined by how much people are willing to buy and sell it for.

There is no registry linking real names to addresses, which helps some Bitcoin users to protect their anonymity.

Bitcoin ""wallets"" operate like privately-run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the bitcoins owned.

The anonymity afforded by digital currencies has attracted people wanting to make illegal purchases on the internet.

A growing number of businesses - including a property venture launched by Scots businesswoman Michelle Mone - now allow customers to buy goods and services with Bitcoin.

The man who helps cryptocurrency addicts is Castle Craig therapist Chris Burn.

He told BBC Scotland the attraction is the same as for those who are pulled into gambling: ""It is a kind of a bubble situation that is very exciting for people, particularly for compulsive gamblers, because excitement is a big part of any addiction. We see this as potentially large.""

He said: ""You have the elements of poor regulation, an air of mystery about it, and the idea of gambling can seem a sort of noble thing to do.

""That and the combination of potential huge gains is really attractive to a lot of people who would never dream of any other addictive activity.""He says the gravity of this potential issue cannot be underestimated.

""This is an addiction and illness that causes a lot of people to end up in despair, even suicide, so it has to be taken very seriously and people need to take practical measures,"" he said.

Chris explained the warning signs to look out for: ""They are quite obvious. You may be making a profit on your trading but if you are spending 16 hours a day staring at a computer you may be losing an awful lot of other elements in your life - friendships, work, exercise. You may be damaging yourself in ways you are not aware of.

""People can get extremely anxious and display physical symptoms - sweating, shaking, unable to sleep, really serious physical symptoms.""",,
