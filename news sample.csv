2019/4/9,Bitcoin mining ban considered by China's economic planner,"Bitcoin creation has joined a list of activities facing a ban in China.

A notice published online in Mandarin by the country's economic planning agency added ""virtual currency mining activities [including] the production process of Bitcoin"" to a list of industries that could be shut down.

The suggestion is that the power consumed by the industry contributes to pollution and wastes resources.

The Chinese public has been invited to comment until 7 May.

The National Development and Reform Commission has not said when the suggested ban might be introduced.

Puzzle prizes
Bitcoin mining involves carrying out computer processor-intensive tasks to solve complicated mathematical problems in order to verify cryptocurrency transactions.

As an incentive to take part, the owners of the equipment that is first to solve a puzzle are rewarded with a batch of newly created bitcoins.

The complexity of the tasks is adjusted to ensure each block of transactions is processed on a regular basis - approximately once every 10 minutes on average. As a consequence, the more computers that compete, the harder the puzzles are made, which in turn means a greater amount of electricity is required to power them.

Some of the world's biggest cryptocurrency mining operations - known as farms - are based in China.

Concerns about them have previously been raised in the country's state-controlled media.

The Xinhua news agency reported in October about a study that suggested related carbon dioxide emissions could feed into global warming, and increase temperatures by two degrees Celsius as soon as 2033.

The news service has also reported on hundreds of mining computers being seized by the authorities following claims they were responsible for abnormal electricity consumption, threatening the smooth running of local power grids.

Last year, one of the country's regulators - the Leading Group of Internet Financial Risks Remediation - called on local governments to direct mining companies to make an ""orderly exit"" from the market.

Chinese regulators have also taken other action against the industry, closing Bitcoin exchanges and banning initial coin offerings (ICOs) as part of a digital currency crackdown in 2017.
However, the FCA concluded that - with relatively small sums involved - the overall scale of harm from volatility in value might not have been as high as previously feared.

'Wild West'
Owing to the lack of regulation, there is no compensation or protection for investors if things go wrong.

Last year, the Treasury Committee of MPs said that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were a ""Wild West industry"" which needed to be regulated to protect investors.

It said that risks of hacking and money-laundering were also concerns.

CryptoUK, which was set up last year as a self-regulatory body for the crypto-currency industry, agreed that there should be official oversight.

""CryptoUK has consistently argued that cryptocurrency investment should be regulated in the UK, to provide greater certainty and to adequately protect consumers,"" said Iqbal Gandham, who chairs the group.

""We are pleased that the government agrees with our approach, and are actively working alongside the FCA and Treasury to help deliver a proportionate and well-designed UK regulatory regime which matches the best of other jurisdictions across the globe.""
The National Development and Reform Commission's intervention appears to have had little effect on the value of Bitcoin.

Its notice was published on Monday, since when one bitcoin has continued to trade for above $5,000 (?3,820) - its highest level since November 2018.",BBC,
2019/3/7,Bitcoin: Crypto investors 'think they can get rich quick',"Investors influenced by friends and social media celebrities are buying Bitcoin and other cryptoassets in an attempt to ""get rich quick"".

But many are putting in their money, with no protection against losses, without fully understanding what they are doing.

The findings are in research published by the Financial Conduct Authority.

Huge volatility has led to warnings about investing in crypto. One industry group has called for regulation.   A heavily-promoted industry in cryptoassets has built up in recent years, with Bitcoin the most popular.

Despite the hype, very few people actually put their money into this kind of unregulated investment, according to the Financial Conduct Authority's research. Its findings suggested:

Only 3% of those asked in the FCA's survey had ever bought cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin
Those who do buy cryptocurrency tend to spend less than ?200
Just one in 100 people who have not done so said they would in the future
Cryptocurrency is primarily understood by men aged 20 to 44, but 73% of all those asked said they could not define it
""Despite this lack of understanding, the cryptoasset owners interviewed were often looking for ways to 'get rich quick' citing friends, acquaintances and social media influencers as key motivations for buying cryptoassets,"" the FCA said.

Huge volatility in these investments have led to warnings across the world of the risks involved.

""Cryptoassets are complex, volatile products - consumers investing in them should be prepared to lose all of their money,"" said Christopher Woolard, of the FCA.However, the FCA concluded that - with relatively small sums involved - the overall scale of harm from volatility in value might not have been as high as previously feared.

2019/1/17,Fake BBC News page used to promote Bitcoin-themed scheme,"An investment scheme is using a fake BBC News webpage to convince members of the public to hand over funds.

The spoof page references a Bitcoin-themed documentary broadcast by Panorama last year, but links on the page direct visitors to a site promising to make them a millionaire.

Reports indicate that the fake page is being spread via emails sent from hacked accounts.

A spokesman for the BBC said it is looking into how best to respond.

The Financial Conduct Authority has previously issued a warning about an earlier scheme run under the same Bitcoin Trader branding that features in the latest effort.

This is not the first time an attempt has been made to link the brand to the BBC.

Last year, adverts appeared on social media and elsewhere falsely claiming that a trading platform operating under the same name had been backed by several of Dragons' Den's stars.

Two of the show's entrepreneurs - Deborah Meaden and Peter Jones - subsequently issued denials.

Ads also claimed that Lord Alan Sugar had quit The Apprentice to help promote its software, leading the businessman to tweet that he had contacted the police. In addition, the former BBC journalist Martin Lewis - who now runs the MoneySavingExpert site - launched legal action against Facebook after it failed to remove fake ads suggesting he was also involved.

And Sir Richard Branson has also warned that fake CNN news pages had been created to make it seem that he had endorsed a Bitcoin Trader-branded scheme.It is not, however, clear whether the people behind the effort are the same as before.

Countdown timer
The fake BBC News page contains a lengthy article describing an ""underground banking system"" that allows investors to turn small deposits into ""a fortune"".

It presents a case study of one individual who supposedly saw an investment of less than ?300 grow into nearly ?900,000.

At the bottom of the page, a countdown clock indicates that there is little time remaining to enrol in the venture.

City of London Police's cyber-crime team has previously warned users against this tactic.

""Always be wary if you're pressured to invest quickly or promised returns that sound too good to be true,"" it said when it discussed the con last April.

One of the indications the latest bogus webpage is fake is its address, which does not correspond to the bbc.co.uk or bbc.com domains used by the broadcaster.

One cyber-security expert said members of the public who receive emails urging them to click any link with an unusual address should in general be cautious of doing so.

""If you are suspicious of any email, search for the page or website in Google rather than clicking the link,"" suggested Lisa Forte, from Red Goat Cyber Security.

""And if you receive the email at work, let your IT team know so they can deal with it appropriately.""",BBC,
