2015/6/3,Final BitLicense Rules for New York State Released Today by NYDFS Superintendent Ben Lawsky,"New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky today released the final version of the BitLicense regulations, saying that his “gut feeling” was that digital currencies are here to stay.The BitLicense program to require digital currencies businesses in New York state to operate with a license and report to government has long been in the making and included two revisions with comment periods to allow for public criticism and input.Many felt that Lawsky had to find a reasonable balance between protecting consumers and allowing digital finance innovators to develop without unnecessary red tape and restrictions.

Lawsky Defends the Need to Regulate

Saying it often “seems like technologists are from Venus and regulators are from Mars,” Lawsky defended the need to “protect consumers” and “root out illicit activities.”Answering the criticism that anti-money-laundering and fraud regulations already existed, he maintained that digital financial systems are very different from the traditional “disco era” banking system and don’t fit the new reality of fintech.

Changes to Final Version of BitLicense Framework

Lawsky said there were five minor changes to the BitLicense program between the second and third versions:

Companies do not need to report on minor changes in the way they do business, but do need to report on a “material change” such as changing from making wallets to running an exchange.
Companies working on fintech software do not need to report, only companies that are holding other people’s money in trust.
Companies do not have to “cross satisfy” under different programs. If you have a trust charter, you don’t need a BitLicense and vice versa.
Companies reporting suspicious activities to federal authorities do not have to also report to NYDFS.
“Passive investors” joining companies do not have to report or get approval. Only a “control person” will need to report to the regulators.
Lawsky noted that his office received 4,000 comments after the first draft was released but only 35 comments after the second draft was released, so they figured they must be closer to “getting it right.”

Who is covered under the BitLicense program 

Businesses covered include those “controlling, administering or issuing a virtual currency” with the following exemptions:

Blockchain technology for noncurrency purposes
Software developers that aren’t engaged directly in money transmission or exchange
Miners
Individual investors
Merchants who accept bitcoin
Licensed banks
Criticisms from the Digital Currencies Community

Many businesses and organizations in the Bitcoin space submitted comments to Lawsky’s office noting that the regulations would create a “bitcoin backwater” as digital currency businesses simply move elsewhere to friendlier jurisdictions.Organizations such as Coin Center and companies such as Coinbase noted that the BitLicense rules simply added another layer of regulations to laws that already exist at the federal level to cover money laundering and fraud. In addition, many commented that Lawsky’s rules put too high a financial burden on new startups, requiring them to buy a license and pay for reporting to government.

The Revolving Door

As was reported earlier, the Cato Institute and others have criticized Lawsky for taking advantage of his role in developing the BitLicense rules and then moving to the private sector to offer consultation and advice on these same regulations.",REGULATION,0.7351
2015/6/25,European Banks Rumored to be Monitoring and Reporting Transactions Related to Bitcoin,"An anonymous Reddit user who self-identifies as bank employee posted a warning saying that his bank received a memo from the national financial institute, with instructions to report anyone who receives more than €1,000 that may be linked to Bitcoin.The five-page memo outlines how surveillance works, how the network is monitored and says that some bitcoin exchanges have been unwilling to cooperate with the authorities. The memo is accompanied by a report, issued by E.U. law enforcement agency Europol, stating that 84 accounts in the country (which hasn’t been disclosed) have been flagged as suspect, and 52 are under surveillance and investigation.The poster says that an earlier related report from the national financial institute is available online.

The report is in Dutch and was released on May 21, 2015 by the Dutch Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) -- which likely implies that the undisclosed country is The Netherlands.The report mentions that bitcoin is used by technology enthusiasts and speculators, but also by criminals who use the digital currency to fund illicit activities and launder money. The report mentions terrorism and child pornography. In 2014 the FIU investigated 75 cases in which bitcoin plays an important role. The results, which led to new investigations, have been shared with foreign financial intelligence units.The poster says that the bank received a list of IBAN accounts that are already constantly monitored because they belong to high-volume traders and exchanges such as Kraken, Bitstamp and BitcoinD.

The bank has to report any transfer above €1,000 that involves those accounts. The bank must also report accounts that receive more than €10,500 per year (outside of salary) if it suspects that the funds originate from bitcoin exchanges.Of course, anonymous reports should always been taken with a grain of salt, but this warning is substantiated by the openly available report by the Dutch FIU, and it makes sense. Now that governments have taken notice of the fact that bitcoin exists and is used by the people, it seems evident that they are trying, or will try, to force the banks to monitor and report transactions to and from bitcoin exchanges, as well as any other transactions that may be linked to bitcoin.

The stated objective of the governments is to fight money laundering and organized crime, and of course they use hot trigger words such as “terrorism” or “child pornography” to persuade the citizens that what they do is right. Almost everyone hates terrorism and child porn, and most people don’t condone money laundering and large-scale tax evasion. But it seems odd that relatively small transfers of €1,000 should be considered suspect.All bitcoin users should know that if they transfer more than €1,000 to or from a bitcoin exchange they could be investigated or monitored. That’s likely to annoy those who are paid in bitcoin (for perfectly legitimate work) and must cash out to pay bills and buy food.

A good way to avoid surveillance, which is becoming easier, is to pay directly in bitcoin for goods and services wherever possible.",REGULATION,-0.9684
2016/2/17,European Commission Plans Crackdown on Bitcoin: New Regulations by June,"The executive body of the European Union (EU) has warned of a further crackdown on virtual currencies in hopes of cutting off financing to terrorists.

Details were revealed recently in the European Commission’s Action Plan for strengthening the fight against terrorist financing and its call for Bitcoin exchanges to come under the supervision of the Anti-Money Laundering Directive.

If proposed legislation passes, virtual currency exchanges would be accountable for gathering comprehensive information about those looking to change bitcoin into traditional currency.

“We must cut off terrorists’ access to funds and enable authorities to better track financial flows to prevent devastating attacks such as those in Paris,” E.U. Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said in a statement.

Forbes has argued the currency has not been that anonymous, as each transaction has been documented on the blockchain. But a spokesperson for the E.C. said the public ledgers were not transparent enough.

“Indeed, public ledgers offer traceability to transactions between accounts,” press officer Letizia Lupini explained. “However, these accounts remain anonymous. This anonymity is potentially an incentive for unlawful activities.”

Regulators and advocacy groups have said more education is needed, not regulation.

Jason Weinstein, director of the Blockchain Alliance, told Bitcoin Magazine that restrictions were not the solution.

“Criminals and terrorists are using all sorts of technology to try to hide their activities over the Internet, but those who turn to Bitcoin as part of that effort are making a big mistake,” he said.

David Long, principal and senior consultant at the Northern California Fraud Prevention Solutions, said it would be easier to launder euros than bitcoins, “Though from an initial investigative standpoint, bitcoins might present more of a challenge due to the necessity of uncovering who is actually responsible for a given transaction or transactions.

“However, once the actor's identity is uncovered, the blockchain makes it possible to uncover most, if not all, of a person's transactions,” Long said. “This capability is without parallel when the subject is dealing in euros or dollars.”

Bitcoin was called the “single, common currency for cybercriminals within the E.U.,” in a 2015 report by Europol. Combined with the claim by Reuters that bitcoin has been the most popular virtual currency, claiming 80 percent of the European market, and in the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks, the E.U. has been compelled to act.

“With today's Action Plan we are moving swiftly to clamp down on terrorist financing, starting with legislative proposals in the coming months,” Dombrovskis said in a press release. “We want to improve the oversight of the many financial means used by terrorists, from cash and cultural artifacts to virtual currencies and anonymous pre-paid cards, while avoiding unnecessary obstacles to the functioning of payments and financial markets for ordinary, law-abiding citizens.""

Yet questions have been raised about whether the regulations will accomplish what the E.C. wants.

“Those looking to remain hidden when they buy and sell bitcoins are likely already avoiding online exchanges. Most exchanges today are already following KYC/AML procedures,” virtual currency expert Michael Yeung said.

There has also been concern about what tougher regulations could mean for small businesses working in Bitcoin.

“Regulation is desirable and required, but regulation that is too onerous may end up destroying legitimate businesses in their infancy,” blockchain researcher and consultant at CryptolQ, Albert Szmigielski said.

Weinstein, director of the Blockchain Alliance, has warned in a Forbes article that complex regulation may pave the way for a black market takeover.

“Regulators should appreciate the fact that most of the Bitcoin companies are startups and do not have a lot of resources,” he said. “The simpler the landscape of compliance rules, the better it is for not only the companies but also the public for whom the regulations are there to protect.”

The new rules will be announced by the end of June. Countries will have until 2017 to put them into effect.",REGULATION,-0.9712
2016/2/24,Japan Considers Regulating Virtual Currencies as Conventional Currency Equivalents,"Japanese legislators officially proposed handling virtual currencies as methods of payment on February 23, Nikkei reports. This would mean that virtual money, such as Bitcoin, would become the regulatory equivalent of conventional currency.

Legislators of the financial services industry believe that this move could potentially strengthen consumer protection and create growth in the virtual economy. At the moment, Bitcoin is recognized as “an object,” but it is not considered equal to more established forms of currency.

The proposed changes to the definition of virtual currencies would mean that items such as Bitcoin could be used to purchase goods and services. Additionally, they would be considered exchangeable for legal tender via trade or purchase.

However, acknowledging virtual currency as an equivalent to conventional currency would require certain institutions to register with the Financial Services Agency.

This is not the first time Japan has examined Bitcoin and its global use, as seen in a press conference held in 2014. At the time, Finance Minister Taro Aso addressed how Bitcoin has been treated in Japan, as well as around the world.

“The media may regard it as such, but it is not a currency that everyone recognizes as currency, so I don’t really know whether the Ministry of Finance or the Financial Services Agency should have jurisdiction over something that is not a currency, whether the Consumer Affairs Agency should have jurisdiction because it is used by consumers, or whether the National Police Agency should have jurisdiction because a crime may have been committed,” said Aso. “In Japan, the issue is quite advanced, so for quite some time I have thought that some actions might have to be taken in Japan, though I think that this time has come much earlier than expected.”

Currently, there are more than 600 forms of virtual currencies used around the world. As of February 24, one bitcoin holds the value of approximately 47,000 Japanese yen.

As the prominence of virtual currencies continues to grow, Nikkei reports that monetary authorities are attempting to institute regulations to address issues, such as money laundering.

In 2015, Aso addressed the use of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies for the purpose of funding terrorism and other crimes.

“I think it was at the G7 summit that discussions addressed the need to introduce regulations in order to prevent terrorist funding, tackle money laundering, and so on,” Aso said. “We’ve gathered a lot of information, and I think that the actual ways the currencies are used need to be properly reflected, and I think that studies need to continue concerning an approach.”",REGULATION,-0.7551
2016/3/10,"Japan Debates Bitcoin Sales Tax, Stricter Rules for Exchanges","The Japanese financial newspaper Nikkei reported in early March that the country’s parliament, the Diet, will soon vote on a set of Bitcoin regulations to be put forward by the ruling cabinet.

The regulations proposed by Finance Minister Taro Aso of the ruling Liberal Democratic cabinet would classify Bitcoin as a currency, impose new requirements on Bitcoin exchanges and allow banks and securities firms to invest and trade in the virtual currency.

Following the collapse of Mt. Gox in early 2014, then the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world, Japan built a firewall separating Bitcoin from the financial sector. Banks were barred from buying and selling bitcoins, and securities firms were prevented from trading the virtual currency.

The proposed regulations would remove the firewall between Bitcoin and the financial sector, according to the Nikkei. Commercial banks would be allowed to provide Bitcoin to customers, and securities firms would be allowed to trade the virtual currency. The government hopes that removing the firewall will encourage the development of Japan’s emerging fintech industry.

The regulations, if passed by the Diet, would mark the first concrete step in a years-long debate about how to deal with Bitcoin. But not all Diet members are pleased with the proposal.

Tsukasa Akimoto, a member of the ruling Liberal Democratic party, asked Finance Minister Aso in a budget meeting in early February if maintaining the consumption tax on Bitcoin transactions would set Japan against the global trend. In response, Aso cited other countries such as Australia that also tax transactions using the virtual currency. As the proposal stands, Japan would continue to levy an 8 percent consumption tax on all purchases made with Bitcoin.

Continuing to tax Bitcoin will put Japan at a disadvantage and discourage its use by consumers, says Yuzo Kano, leader of the Japan Authority of Digital Assets, an industry group that advocates for virtual currencies. Kano says that Japan is “going against the world,” and that continuing the consumption tax will hurt Japan’s competitiveness in the emerging fintech ecosystem.

According to Kano, international Bitcoin traders make a business of “importing” bitcoins into Japan from untaxed exchanges overseas. Kano is calling for a “level playing field” to stop the importation of Bitcoin from other countries.

The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ruled in September that Bitcoin is a commodity, empowering the agency to monitor businesses that trade the virtual currency. Because Bitcoin is classified as property in the United States, states and cities can levy sales taxes on Bitcoin transactions, although none have done so. On the other side of the Atlantic, the European Union Court ruled in October that Bitcoin is a currency, not a commodity, and therefore cannot be taxed.

Of the Group of 7 countries, only Japan taxes purchases made with Bitcoin. The upcoming G7 meeting in May will be held in Japan, and how to regulate virtual currencies is set to be a major topic of discussion.

Whether or not Japan continues to tax Bitcoin transactions, Bitcoin exchanges would face increased scrutiny under the proposed regulations. Exchanges would have to meet a mandatory minimum capital requirement of 10 million yen, keep company and customer assets separate and submit to auditing by certified public accountants.

Exchanges would also be required to follow the same know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) rules as banks and other financial service providers, confirming the identities of clients and reporting suspicious trading to financial authorities.

According to Motokazu Endo, an attorney specializing in financial legislation, many of Japan’s Bitcoin exchanges have weak financial bases, which the proposed regulations could expose.",REGULATION,0.6597
2016/3/18,Japan Debates Regulating Bitcoin as Currency; Banks Eager to Study Blockchain,"Japan recently made headlines by announcing that its government was considering defining Bitcoin and other digital currencies as currency rather than commodity.

This was confirmed by Tomonori Kanda, representing the financial affairs section of the Liberation Democratic Party (LDP). He told The Guardian that the plan was to bring the matter up in Parliament. 

Even after the Mt. Gox fiasco, Japan recognized Bitcoin’s potential two years ago, and asked members within the Bitcoin and blockchain industry to form a self-regulatory authority called the Japan Authority of Digital Assets (JADA). 

JADA is supported by LDP’s IT committee, and is currently in discussion with Japanese government offices. There is no specific governmental office that regulates JADA, which currently has four members: bitFlyer, Orb, Kraken and Coincheck, and several supporting members such as Deloitte. 

JADA meets with FSA (a Japanese government organization and ntegrated financial regulator responsible for overseeing banking, securities and exchange and insurance sectors) and other governmental bodies (such as the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Bank of Japan) once a month, and is in constant discussion with the National Tax Authority (NTA), police agency and other governmental offices.

Bitcoin Magazine talked with JADA’s legal counsel So Saito, who said, “Our first activity was to establish self-regulatory rules regarding AML [anti-money laundering], security protection and consumer protection. The recent topic we’ve been discussing is a new law. 

“FSA asked us about the current situation in the industry, current issues and desired regulation,” he said. “Some media outlets wrote that Bitcoin would be regarded as currency. I, however, do not think that Japan would regard Bitcoin as currency.”

He added: 

“I have heard that FSA was to submit new regulation to the lower house on March 4. I have not yet got the actual article. However, another media outlet said that cryptocurrency will be defined as ‘Property value, which can be used when a person purchases goods, etc. from a non-specific person and can be electronically transferred.’ I believe that this definition is more close to the actual definition of the new regulation.”

As to the future, Saito said, “I welcome new Bitcoin [currency] regulation. Traditional financial institutions are generally hesitant to deal with Bitcoin because it’s currently non-regulated. I expect more traditional companies will advance to the [regulated] Bitcoin world.

“Traditional financial institutions (including Japanese megabanks) are eager to study blockchain.  There are many announcements stating that Japanese companies have started demonstration experiments with blockchain technology. We have discussed new regulations with FSA.""

Saito said that he was unable to disclose further details of these discussions at this time, but Bitcoin Magazine will follow developments.

Self-regulatory bodies such as JADA may provide insight for governments around the world looking at approaches to regulating Bitcoin and blockchain technology. ",REGULATION,0.3612
2016/3/19,Coinbase's Fred Ehrsam: Bitcoin Turns Finance Into a Software Problem,"On a recent episode of the 1776 Podcast, Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam and 1776 co-founder Evan Burfield discussed the concept of regulatory hacking in the context of Bitcoin. 

Regulatory hacking is a philosophy that 1776, a business incubator based in Washington, D.C, has taken to heart, and the basic premise is to find new ways to change or circumvent regulations that slow down progress in certain industries. Ehrsam mentioned some of these industries during the podcast:

“You have a few select industries, which it sounds like you guys at 1776 are focused on here, which have not been disrupted to date a whole lot, largely because they tend to be more centralized and/or government regulated. Those include finance, healthcare and education. There are others, but those are the big three that I would think about.”

Bitcoin’s open, permissionless and censorship-resistant nature makes it a potentially powerful tool for regulatory hacking in the area of finance.

Bitcoin Turns Finance Into a Software Problem

When asked for his overall perspective on the importance of Bitcoin, Ehrsam talked about how the blockchain turns finance into nothing more than a software problem. As opposed to the highly regulated and slow-to-adapt traditional financial system, creating a financial application on top of Bitcoin requires nothing more than the ability to write some code. 

The Coinbase co-founder then talked about the positive effects on society found when real-world problems become software problems:

“We’ve all seen what happens when a problem becomes a software problem; the level of innovation and the rate at which iteration can occur just goes through the roof. As a result, you get way more great ideas being built, and the consumer usually ends up winning, too, because the services are better and the fees go down.”

In other words, the competition associated with an open, somewhat-lawless system creates better situations for entrepreneurs and consumers. As Ehrsam put it, “Said another way, [software problems] are subject to real market forces rather than being closed. It’s open, just like what we’ve seen with the Internet.”

The Frustrations Related to Old, Closed Financial Systems

In order to describe the benefits of Bitcoin’s openness, Burfield covered the issues related to the traditional financial system. He noted:

“I don’t think most people can actually articulate just how frustrating interacting with financial services on a day-to-day basis actually ‒ like, there’s so many dumb things that you encounter over and over again.”

Burfield then explained that the problems associated with traditional financial services companies have not been as obvious in the past due to the lack of an open system to be compared against:

“We just, sort of, accept that as part of the background noise of leading our daily lives, and until you flip it and start to get innovators attacking the problem without all of the barriers a closed system encounters, I don’t think you can even start to show people where things should be at.”

Burfield went on to contrast Bitcoin with the financial system in Africa. While a money transfer between two parties in different African nations routinely costs more than 10 percent of the transaction’s value, and central bankers are sometimes not resistant to the temptation to print more money, Bitcoin has extremely low costs as a payment settlement network and has a monetary policy that is essentially controlled by the users of the digital currency.

Is Coinbase Involved with Regulatory Hacking?

When asked for Coinbase’s approach to regulatory hacking, Ehrsam was quick to note that the concept is difficult to apply to the financial services industry today, especially in the United States. He explained:

“I think it’s more difficult for people in financial services, generally speaking, than other industries, like the taxi industry for example, to do what you would think of as regulatory hacking. The reality is that financial services are highly regulated by many, many different parties, whereas you might just have one in other industries. Also, just given the recent past in financial services, it tends to be an area of extreme focus ‒ maybe more so than any other point of history in the United States.”

Ehrsam then stated that Coinbase’s approach to regulators has been rather friendly:

“Our approach, as a result, has actually been quite the opposite; it’s to proactively go to regulators early on and say, ‘Hey. Here we are. We’re good guys. You can know us. If you have questions, please come to us.’”

Coinbase has taken a lot of flack in the Bitcoin community due to its compliance with regulations, but the reality is that it would be shut down rather quickly if it didn’t follow the law. Recently, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong published a Medium post where he pointed out that the company is an exchange and not a wallet provider. In the past, ShapeShift CEO and longtime Bitcoin entrepreneur Erik Voorhees has defended Coinbase against various attacks from the community.

Bitcoin Won’t Create a Libertarian Utopia

Although Evan Burfield sees the need for more regulatory hackers in the world, he does not feel that Bitcoin is going to create some sort of libertarian utopia. He explained:

“The idea that Bitcoin is going to be this completely libertarian utopia where there’s zero regulation and complete anonymity is probably not real practical when you look at stuff like this.”

Ehrsam mostly agreed with Burfield’s stance. He added:

“The reality is maybe somewhere in between where businesses that operate on the Internet are subject to all the same laws and regulations, but the reality is that we now have a more open environment, which you could argue is libertarian in some ways. But the net result, I agree, is not complete libertarian utopia. It’s more about the services that this brings that fundamentally couldn’t have existed before.”

There has always been perceived tension between the early adopters of Bitcoin and the people who want to take the technology to the general public. It’s important to remember that, while the businesses built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain can be regulated, the base protocol is much harder for regulators to get their hands around.

The aspects of Bitcoin that do bring more libertarian, or even anarchistic, ideals into the real world are usually found in software rather than startups. A company can be targeted and shut down, but individuals are free to run open-source code, such as JoinMarket or Dark Wallet, on their own computers. Bitcoin is far from anonymous right now, but it will be interesting to see what happens if more privacy-enhancing features are added to the protocol.",REGULATION,-0.4019
2016/4/4,Tax Day Is Coming: A Primer on Bitcoin and Taxes,"For workers, anything received as payment for goods or services, including Bitcoin or other digital currencies, is taxable income unless it is specifically exempted. 

If you earn income in Bitcoin in the exchange of services with another person, this will be included in gross income and would be subject to income tax. These bitcoins could furthermore be subject to self-employment tax.

In some places, if you earn money by trading bitcoins or running an exchange, this could be included in gross income and treated as capital gains. This interpretation assumes bitcoins are used as a store of value like gold or another commodity. If treated as currency or debt, the gains could be taxed based on market value at the end of each tax year. 

Some common sense assumptions about how Bitcoin will be regulated can be made by the nature of Bitcoin itself â€’ for instance, by tying the value of bitcoins to the local fiat currency. So when one receives a bitcoin, a note should be made of that coin’s USD value (or whatever currency) as a cost basis for tax reporting.  

The existing framework applies to miners. Mined coins are recorded as income from mining and are taxable, and expenses are deducted. Many miners sell their bitcoins, and miners are taxed on the increase in Bitcoin value from the time the coins were mined and the value for which they sold. If this is a loss, then this loss can be declared. 

In the United States, the IRS issued guidance for Bitcoin and other digital currencies in its March 2014-21 Notice.  The IRS clarified its position on digital currencies, which it views as capital assets and thus subject to capital gains taxes. Trading and spending is a taxable event and capital gains must be calculated in USD. 

The IRS also stated mined bitcoins are treated as immediate income at the market value of those mined coins on their date of mining.

“Most don’t know they can write off any losses they have,” said Libra founder Jake Benson. “The IRS allows you to offset income by up to $3,000 per year on capital losses.  If you have losses and you aren’t writing them off, then it’s like throwing money away. Nobody likes doing taxes, but if you can owe less or increase your return, then doing your Bitcoin taxes often results in a benefit. In fact, the majority of our users are filing a capital loss, which means they’ve actually saved money by using our tool.” 

Benson also gives insight for miners. 

“Mining is considered income, so know the price of Bitcoin at the time you mined it,” he said. “If you make money on Bitcoin trading, the IRS requires that you report gains with line level detail.”  The appropriate form for that is 8949, a sub-form of schedule D. Gains and losses, as outlined above, are treated like every other capital asset. 

“Bitcoin cannot be considered a foreign currency by the IRS because it’s not legal tender and it’s not produced by a government,” he said. “Though it functions like a currency, the letter of the law is very clear.”

There have been numerous decisions by government bodies regarding the regulation of Bitcoin. For instance, the Commodity Futures Trade Commission ruled Bitcoin can be treated as a commodity. Commodities are taxed with 60/40 rules. Other capital assets, basic securities for instance, are taxed with short and long term rates. 

“The IRS might need to issue another notice that clarifies which method to follow because taxpayers may get confused,” Benson noted. On a global level, some places are better than others when it comes to taxation. Benson cites Australia as one such region. 

“Like Europe, there is a concept of Value Added Tax (VAT) called GST,” he said. “Without getting into too much detail, Australia's tax authority decided that the GST applies to all sales of Bitcoin. That decision basically prevented any Bitcoin exchange from operating in Australia because they would be forced to apply a 10 percent markup on top of market price. Europe also has a concept of VAT, and a court there recently ruled Bitcoin would not be subject to VAT.  This would have a  huge impact on Bitcoin businesses that are involved with the purchase and sale of Bitcoin.”  Benson notes, however, this is undergoing a change. 

Few countries have outlawed Bitcoin. In some countries though, there is no tax applied to capital gains at all, which results in a essentially no tax obligations for owners or traders of Bitcoin. Benson believes regulators are investigating their options when it comes to the regulation and taxation of Bitcoin. In the UK, regulators determined VAT would not apply to Bitcoin sales. 

“Probably closer than one would assume,” Benson noted. “An IRS agent was capable of tracing tumbled coins on the blockchain as evidence in the case regarding Carl Force from the DEA. He was sentenced to jail for six-and-a-half months. It’s quite common for individuals in the Bitcoin industry to villainize government, but I’ve observed that it’s also common for individuals to underestimate government prudence.” 

There are some obstacles when it comes to filing Bitcoin taxes, Benson admits, such as the aggregation of transactional data. “Most people have more than one exchange account and more than a few wallets,” he said. “

In the future, Benson believes Bitcoin will treated similarly as today. 

“Realistically, the same way it is now,” he said. “For perspective, it took the IRS 15 years to produce tax rules that applied to derivatives.  If special guidance for digital currency is to ever come, I would predict at least a decade. Furthermore, you have cost basis reporting rules on fancy asset types that were only finalized in place about 3 years ago.  If anything, I would guess the reporting requirements 10 years from now will be more than what they are today.”",REGULATION,0.9929
2016/4/13,US Comptroller of the Currency Calls for Innovative Regulations on Digital Currencies and FinTech,"Comptroller of the Currency Thomas J. Curry, who heads an independent department in charge of supervising all U.S. national banks, stated in a speech April 7 at the American Banker Retail Banking Conference that “it’s important that regulators are open to the changes that are underway in both technology and business practices,” according to prepared remarks shared with Bitcoin Magazine.

The comptroller signalled a shift in attitudes toward fintech regulations, an umbrella term used to describe companies or services that use a combination of finance and technology, with Bitcoin being the most prominent example. 

Announcing a number of new initiatives, such as “innovator fairs” that aim to bring banks and nonbank innovators together with OCC experts, and the sponsorship of a forum on responsible innovation to be held in Washington on June 23, Curry made it clear that “[T]he Office of the Comptroller of the Currency [OCC] want[s] to support efforts by federal banks to innovate.” He added, “But we also want to be sure that they do so in a responsible way that doesn’t threaten the safety of the system or the financial well-being of bank customers.”

In his more striking remarks the comptroller stated:

“[I]t’s not unreasonable to characterize the change underway in the financial marketplace as revolutionary. But purists might point out that real revolutions sweep away existing institutions. That hasn’t happened,” he said, but warned: “without change, banks could go the way of other businesses that failed to adapt to changing times.”

In potentially historic closing remarks Curry stated:

“If there is a revolution underway in financial services ... those of you in retail banking are on the frontlines. What I want you to know is that the OCC is ready to support you as you engage in the kind of responsible innovation that serves the needs of all financial consumers and makes our financial system stronger than ever.”

OCC is being hailed as the appropriate regulatory body to oversee an overhaul of outdated financial regulations, some as old as a century, to adapt to the changing needs of the 21st century and, in particular, to foster a welcoming environment for fintech innovation.

The remarks signal an overall change in attitude of both banks and regulators toward fintech just as London is declared the financial capital of the world for the second year running, beating New York by only 8 points out of 1,000 primarily because of London’s vibrant fintech sector. 

British regulators have introduced fintech’s “most progressive, forward-looking regulatory regime” in the world, according to city minister and economic secretary to the U.K. Treasury Harriett Baldwin. She was commenting on the recent announcement of an unprecedented partnership between Barclays and Circle. U.S. regulators have noticed and they are now loudly asking for a shift in the way fintech companies are regulated.

The debate was opened by CFTC’s Commissioner J. Christopher Giancarlo, who hailed the benefits of blockchain and called for a light-touch regulatory approach similar to the strategy employed in the early days of the Internet. He made the remarks in a special address to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation 2016 Blockchain Symposium last week.

“[A] dramatic example of the potential benefits to regulators of blockchain technology is in the collapse of Lehman Brothers,” Giancarlo said.

Since then, the OCC issued a white paper calling for comments and suggestions on how to regulate “responsible innovation.” In opening remarks about the white paper, Curry stated:

“[R]apid and dramatic advances in financial technology are beginning to disrupt the way traditional banks do business. … At the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), we are making certain that institutions with federal charters have a regulatory framework that is receptive to responsible innovation along with the supervision that supports it.”

Meanwhile, London races ahead. In a speech at Money 20/20 Europe, Hannah Nixon, managing director of U.K.’s Payment Systems Regulator, a first-of-its-kind independent regulator, highlighted Britain’s enthusiasm for financial innovation in stating:

“[W]e want to encourage technological innovation. Not for innovation’s sake, but to drive improvements for users, helping payment companies find new and ever more convenient ways for people to pay.

“In fact, we want the U.K. industry to become a center of innovation, to lead the world in the development of payment systems. And I believe the PSR can play a major part in that.

“We want people to look at U.K. payment systems and the PSR, and say, ‘We want to do it like that.’”

They have so far succeeded; consultancy firm Ernst & Young recently crowned London the ""Fintech Capital of the World."" Moreover, while British banks earned a reputation in the Bitcoin community for being notoriously against granting bank accounts to Bitcoin and other digital-currency-related businesses, that too seems to be changing. The shift in attitude may be, in part, due to PSR. 

Echoing criticisms often expressed in the Bitcoin community, Nixon stated:

“The evidence we gathered showed that wider financial crime regulations may be causing people to be overcautious about doing business with a third party.”

Although she warns that “we would need to show our teeth from time to time,” she states that PSR “won’t be taking direct action” because PSR is aware a number of banks are “planning to start offering indirect access or expand their current services.” One such bank may be Barclays which, in an unprecedented move, partnered with Circle.

“Historically, obtaining U.K. banking has been challenging for U.K. Bitcoin companies; however recent events show that this situation is beginning to change,” Obi Nwosu, managing director at Coinfloor, a British-based Bitcoin exchange, stated in an email.

The winds of change are, therefore, once again in the air. As more than $20 billion has been invested globally in fintech, and investment in Bitcoin companies saw its second best quarter ever in the first quarter of 2016, it is perhaps time to repeat the remarks of George Osborn, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who, in a speech in 2014 declared: “We stand at the dawn of a new era in banking.”",REGULATION,0.4404
2016/4/25,The United States Is Falling Behind in Bitcoin Regulation,"Lawmakers and regulators in the United States could be doing a much better job attracting innovative fintech startups to the country, Coin Center Executive Director Jerry Brito said at a recent cryptocurrency-focused event hosted by the Cato Institute.

Although the United States started out as the leader in Bitcoin regulation, it is now falling behind other jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, where innovation in fintech and digital currency is being embraced with open arms.

The U.S. Has Been a Leader in Bitcoin Regulation

In 2013, the U.S. Senate held the first hearings on Bitcoin. In that same year, FinCEN released the first announcement by any government agency related to the technology. The IRS was also the first tax agency in the world to clarify the tax treatment of Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Additionally, BitLicense in New York was the first licensing regime in the world directed at digital currencies.

“Although certainly imperfect, each of these pronouncements brought clarity and certainty to an emerging industry, and these approaches were copied around the world,” Brito said at the Cato event.

Other Countries Are Going Further

Brito also noted that the United States’ role as the regulatory leader for Bitcoin around the world is not guaranteed to last. 

Other countries are beginning to start regulatory regimes that don’t merely tolerate cryptocurrency firms, but welcome them with open arms, he said.

Brito pointed to the United Kingdom as a specific example of a country looking to foster growth in the digital currency space:

“The U.K., for example, has created a regulatory framework that bends over backward to make it easy and quick for innovative startups and entrepreneurs to comply with the appropriate consumer protection regulations and safely enter the market.”

Project innovate was an initiative Brito used to bring home his point about the U.K.’s embracement of fintech. This project offers dedicated teams to startups to make sure they understand the various regulations that apply to them.

Once a business is regulated in the U.K., it’s also able to operate throughout the rest of the European Union. Brito pointed to Circle’s recent partnership with Barclays as an example of this sort of regulatory structure creating an environment for more connections between startups and the traditional banking system.

In the past, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne has stated that the plan is to make London “the global center for fintech. ... The race is on, but we are determined to win it.”

Current Status of Regulation in the U.S.

So how is the U.S. doing in comparison to the U.K.?

Brito said that only one BitLicense has been issued (to Circle), and at least 27 companies are still waiting in line for approval. He also noted that efforts to offer regulatory clarity, such as digital currency legislation in California, have stalled. Brito added that Coin Center is currently working with legislators in half a dozen states on various proposals for the regulation of digital currencies.

Another key issue often brought up on the regulation of fintech firms in the United States is that a different license is required for practically every state. 

“Not only is this time-consuming and costly, but the states have not all explained if and how cryptocurrency businesses need to comply,” Brito said. “At the federal level, we only see the most tentative steps toward a pro-innovation agenda.”

What Can the U.S. Do Differently?

In addition to pointing out the current issues with digital currency regulation in the United States, Brito also offered some possible solutions.

“Serious action by federal banking regulators [is needed] to make it clear to banks that it’s perfectly fine ‒ and even encouraged ‒ to establish relationships with innovative fintech and digital currency firms,” he said.

Brito also pointed out the obvious need to create a new regulatory environment where startups are not forced to get a license from every state in which they wish to operate.

“Politically, these options are uphill battles, but if we don’t think big, somebody else will,” he said.",REGULATION,0.296
2016/5/18,Erik Voorhees: Complying With BitLicense Would Have Made ShapeShift Hack Much Worse,"The recent hacks at ShapeShift, a sort of vending machine for altcoins, has been one of the biggest stories in Bitcoin for the past few weeks. Although the hacks were a serious hit to the exchange, CEO Erik Voorhees claims things could have been much worse if the startup had decided to comply with BitLicense regulations in New York.

Traditional Regulations Won’t Work

Voorhees was recently on a panel related to disruptive Bitcoin companies at Consensus 2016. OB1 CEO Brian Hoffman, Blockstack Labs co-founder Ryan Shea, and Lightning CEO Elizabeth Stark were also featured on the panel. The panel was moderated by Chamber of Digital Commerce President Perianne Boring.

The topic of regulation came up on multiple occasions during the panel discussion, and Voorhees, a vocal critic of various forms of Bitcoin-related regulations, did not hold back in sharing his contempt for the various legal restrictions that have been placed on Bitcoin (especially the New York BitLicense).

Voorhees made the point that traditional regulations ‒ when applied to Bitcoin or other blockchains ‒ are like fitting a “square peg into a round hole.” Voorhees said that placing restrictions on the development of this new financial technology would be akin to requiring bloggers to get some sort of publishing license in the early days of the Internet.

Why BitLicense Would Have Made the ShapeShift Hack Worse

Voorhees also used the multiple hacks and thefts he’s recently had to deal with to make a point about how traditional regulations should not be applied to Bitcoin. In regard to the hacks, Voorhees stated:

“You can bet that if we had, for example, followed the New York Bitlicense and were taking personal, private information of every single customer that was on our website, all of that personal and private information would now be in the hands of the hacker [and] all over the dark web.”

Voorhees has been extremely transparent with everything that has happened in relation to the hacks. He wrote a full report of events, talked about it on the Bitcoin.com podcast, and answered further questions for Epicenter Bitcoin.

The Blockchain Offers True Consumer Protection

One of the reasons Voorhees has a disdain for the BitLicense is that, in his view, it makes consumers less safe. For example, ShapeShift does not have to collect practically any information related to their customers because crypto tokens work like digital cash.

The fact that ShapeShift does not have to collect information or funds from their customers removes a liability from the exchange’s side and increases security for users. 

“To me, that is true consumer protection through design, and that’s one of the magic things that blockchains allow,” Voorhees added.

New York is the only jurisdiction in the entire world blocked by ShapeShift. In this particular case, it appears that ShapeShift made the correct decision from a consumer protection perspective.",REGULATION,-0.624
2016/5/25,ISO May Propose Certified Standards for Blockchains and Distributed Ledgers,"In April when the Bitcoin community began preparing for Australian Craig Wright’s “Satoshi Nakamoto reveal,” there was another announcement from Down Under that was overlooked.  

On April 14, Standards Australia, a non-government, not-for-profit standards organization announced that “Australia proposes International Blockchain Standards” and included a proposal for a “new field of technical activity.”

This proposal was registered with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the world's largest developer of voluntary international standards, and on April 19, The American National Standards Institute announced that  “ANSI Seeks Comments on New ISO Field of Activity on Blockchain and Electronic Distributed Ledger Technologies.” The United States has access to the ISO standards development processes through ANSI.

Standards Australia also released an explainer fact sheet called “Blockchain & Electronic Distributed Ledger Technologies New Field of Technical Activity.” It ponders “Why do we need blockchain standards?” and postulates that:

“[...] Blockchain is still an emerging technology and issues such as data sovereignty, privacy, and lack of consensus are causing headaches for policy makers, regulators and industry alike. Notwithstanding, Australian stakeholders and government want this technology to be sustainable in the long-term. ISO and its members have an important role to play in making this a reality. ...The proposed international standards for blockchain will focus on technical solutions that promote interoperability, and compatibility between existing systems. This will allow the technology to be more widely used and deployed.”

Bitcoin Is a Standard

As the “invisible ships” lore (or myth) goes: Native Americans could not perceive the fleet of ships about to invade their homeland because the armada was so alien to their collective experiences that they were unable to see their aggressors. One could make a similar comparison with groups seeking to standardize blockchains. Public blockchains such as Bitcoin or Ethereum are in and of themselves protocols or standards.  Institutions that are trying to (re)define what a blockchain is in the name of standardization are trying to co-opt the technology and may not even realize that they are staring at a standard.  A blockchain with(in) a layer of standards is a paradox. This governance creates a needless metalayer of friction and complexity. However, while Bitcoin is a standard, its decentralized nature means that it has no formal structure.  That said, Bitcoin utilizes a BIP or Bitcoin Improvement Proposal as the de facto way of introducing features (via Github). 

In fact, BIP 123, or “BIP Classification” created by Bitcoin Core Developer Eric Lombrozo explains that:

“Bitcoin is a system involving a number of different standards. Some standards are absolute requirements for interoperability while others can be considered optional, giving implementors a choice of whether to support them. In order to have a BIP process which more closely reflects the interoperability requirements, it is necessary to categorize BIPs. …” 

A Chip Off the Old Blockchain?

Bitcoin is no stranger to ISO or standardization for that matter. Back in 2014, Jon Matonis, then the executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, penned an article for CoinDesk “Why Bitcoin Needs an ISO-Certified Currency Code.” The Bitcoin Foundation for its part was founded with standardization in its vision.  According to its words at the time, “[The] Bitcoin Foundation standardizes, protects and promotes the use of Bitcoin cryptographic money for the benefit of users worldwide.”  

Bitcoin Magazine spoke with Manu Sporny, chairman of the W3C Web Payments Community Group and CEO of Digital Bazaar. The W3C or The World Wide Web Consortium is the international standards organization for the World Wide Web. When calling Bitcoin a standard Sporny said:

“It depends on if you are talking about ‘de jure’ standards or ‘de facto’ standards. Bitcoin could be argued to be a ‘de facto’ standard, but even that argument is a bit weak since systems like Ethereum exist. When you have a standard, you're looking for true interoperability. That is, multiple companies can follow the standard and come up with systems that interoperate. The Web is a good example of a set of interoperable standards. Bitcoin hasn't hit that point yet, as much of the control over the core of Bitcoin is in the hands of very few developers and one major reference implementation. I think it's shaky to call Bitcoin a standard. It's a really interesting experiment.”

Meanwhile, Sporny notes that W3C has a Blockchain standardization workshop, Blockchains and the Web: A W3C Workshop on Distributed Ledgers on the Web scheduled on June 29–30 at MIT Media Lab.  

Down Under

The Australian proposal mentions leveraging pre-existing standards such as ISO 20022 which “defines the fields and controls within messages and transaction between entities thus allowing interoperability.” However, this was on the heels of Reuters' news story that hackers compromised the SWIFT software of Bangladesh Bank. 

While Standards Australia notes that, “The work will exclude legal obligations and regulatory matters addressed by government jurisdictions,” it also proposes to “Embed compliance to money laundering and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements.”

Stakeholders

The proposal is just one of many blockchain land grabs by legacy actors trying to stay relevant in a world of Bitcoin governance. This proposal aims to “position ISO as a leading contributor to develop global solutions to facilitate data movement and information flows thus enabling more efficient and timely transactions” by establishing blockchain standards.

According to Standards Australia it is consulting with stakeholders on this proposal and intends to spearhead the ISO work if approved. For more information or to make a submission, contact Varant Meguerditchian (varant.meguerditchian@standards.org.au) by June 19.

ANSI asks that comments are submitted to Steve Cornish (scornish@ansi.org), ANSI senior director of international policy, by June 3. Based on this feedback, the ANSI ISO Council will determine ANSI’s position, and comments should be submitted to ISO before its July 14 voting deadline. ",REGULATION,0.9805
2016/6/9,European Securities and Markets Authority Issues Discussion Paper on Distributed Ledger Technology,"The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has issued a discussion paper titled “The Distributed Ledger Technology Applied to Securities Markets” for a public consultation on distributed ledger technology (DLT). ESMA is seeking feedback on the possible use of DLT in securities markets, including potential benefits and risks.

The Telegraph notes that shares could eventually be traded almost instantly without the costly safety net of clearing houses by using the blockchain, the building blocks of Bitcoin, although the technology remains at an early stage. While DLT was first deployed to run the Bitcoin network, it could be adopted to streamline securities trading.

ESMA began analyzing virtual currencies in 2013 and then analyzed investments using virtual currencies or DLT, including possible risks and benefits, on which ESMA is now seeking more in-depth feedback to further its assessment. 

The public “Consultation on the Distributed Ledger Technology Applied to Securities Markets” runs from June 2 to September 2, 2016. Stakeholders and other interested parties are invited to respond to the questions stated in the discussion paper and describe alternatives that ESMA should consider. In particular, the ESMA is seeking feedback and opinions from fintech companies and financial institutions interested in the use of DLT in securities markets such as banks, central counterparties, central securities depositaries, custodians, asset managers and investors. 

Two of the key questions asked, which seem especially representative as indication of ESMA’s targets, are, “If you are working on a concrete application of the DLT to securities markets please describe it (i.e., which activities, which market segments, which type of assets and for which expected benefits) and explain where you stand in terms of practical achievements in relation to your objectives,” and “Do you see potential regulatory impediments to the deployment of the DLT in securities markets?”

ESMA will use the feedback provided by the participants in the consultation to develop a position on the use of DLT in securities markets and, in particular, to assess whether a regulatory response may be needed.

ESMA appreciates that DLT may have different applications and impacts on financial activities, market participants and market infrastructures, depending on a variety of elements, including its capacity to address a number of technical, governance, legal and regulatory issues. A disclaimer notes that it’s too early to form a definitive official position on DLT. With the publication of the discussion paper, the authority does not intend to express a firm position on the DLT, but rather present “in a factual and objective manner” the results of its preliminary analysis on the possible impacts of the DLT on securities markets.

According to the authority’s preliminary analysis, DLT could ultimately become the trusted source for the record of ownership of securities and safekeeping of assets. It could speed the clearing and settlement of certain financial transactions, by reducing the number of intermediaries involved and by making the reconciliation process more efficient. Additional benefits could come from the possibility of combining clearing and settlement of transactions into a single step, which would be almost instantaneous.

DLT could also facilitate the recording of ownership of a variety of securities and the safekeeping of assets, the implementation of a unique reference system across securities markets, and the collection, consolidation and sharing of data for reporting, risk management and supervisory purposes.

In a reference to emerging trends in DLT, the ESMA notes that smart contracts implemented on top of distributed ledgers could increase automation and reduce uncertainty and risk. In another interesting statement inspired by an emerging trend, pioneered, among others, by Overstock, the authority notes that “DLT could also be used to directly issue digital securities and track their ownership and help supporting issuance related services.”

Two important arguments in favor of DLT are security and cost. The document notes that the perceived high security of DLT ‒ which according to the authority “remains to be tested” ‒ is due to the distributed nature of the ledger, which doesn’t present a single point of attack, and the use of cryptography and consensus to secure and validate transactions. “These features could help mitigate the risk of a cyber-attack,” notes the authority. “They could also reduce the need for recovery plans, since the records would be kept in several places at the same time.” A general reduction of costs is another suggested benefit of DLT.

Among the perceived shortcomings of existing DLT mentioned in the paper, scalability and interoperability have a central role, and risks are thoroughly analyzed. It’s worth noting that the authority clearly favors “permissioned” ledgers over the  “permissionless” model used in the Bitcoin network, where everyone ‒ including non-vetted anonymous participants ‒ can operate a network node and validate transactions.

The ESMA document notes that the capacity of DLT to fit into the existing regulatory framework may limit its deployment, and analyzes the key E.U. regulations likely to apply, and what requirement they would impose on the participants in DLT networks.",REGULATION,0.3612
2016/6/29,"China Signals a New, Accepting Approach to Digital Currencies","China’s government has signaled that it is warming up to digital currency with a new proposed civil law that may recognize people’s legal right to own virtual assets, including digital currencies.

A new draft of China’s civil code was introduced in The National People’s Congress June 27. The draft will reportedly designate all virtual networks, data and information as property equal to physical and other financial assets, bringing them under the jurisdiction of civil rights that are applicable to property in general.

OKCoin founder and CEO Star Xu told Bitcoin Magazine that the new draft law is good news saying:

""The central bank defined Bitcoin as a ""virtual commodity"" in 2013; however, digital assets are different from traditional properties in a sense due to their virtual features. That makes it difficult to be incorporated into the traditional ‘object’ which is normally categorized as ‘chattel’ and ‘real estate.’

“Since the Chinese law have not clearly defined the virtual asset in the past, property disputes involving ‘virtual commodities’ are difficult to be resolved under the existing law. This proposed new civil law draft, which includes digital assets with legal rights, will contribute to the protection of such property rights while also establishing a framework for the development of future specific rules. 

“It is the manifestation of legal progress in China and it will benefit the Bitcoin industry in the long term.”

The Chinese government has taken a wait-and-see stance until now, appreciating that China should not fall behind the rest of the world in innovations such as Bitcoin and blockchain technologies, but conscious, too, of the possible effect on China’s central currency, the yuan. 

Huobi Chief of Staff Yue Wen told Bitcoin Magazine that:

“Without any doubt, the new draft of Civil Code is an improvement of Chinese law system, even though there is not much difference in enforcement until now. Based on our experience of cooperative investigation, bitcoins have been recognized as personal assets to protect in real cases. Policies will help to trace when citizens' bitcoins have been stolen.”

Yue Wen explained:

“Until now, the only legal document of Bitcoin was Notice for Preventing the Risks of Bitcoin, released by five commissions (People's Bank of China, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People's Republic of China, China Banking Regulatory Commission, China Securities Regulatory Commission, China Insurance Regulatory Commission) in 2013, in which Bitcoin has been defined as visual commodity. Visual commodity is not an object of any law in China so far, so we don't think there is any big difference now in enforcement.” 

He added:

“Also, the new draft is still a discussion version now, we're also paying attention to the progress and hoping for good news.”

In a recent interview, BTCC CEO Bobby Lee acknowledged that the Chinese government has been signaling acceptance of the growth of Bitcoin trading in China for some time. He told Bitcoin Magazine that the central bank, PBOC, has indicated that it is open to new innovations and does not feel threatened by digital currencies.

“I do think that it is great that the PBOC is looking into the technology behind Bitcoin. I think all central banks should look into this technology, and look into adopting existing digital currencies like Bitcoin as part of their basket of reserve currencies.”

However, ChinaLedger, a research and development consortium of Wanxiang Blockchain Labs in China told CoinDesk that the language of the proposed law is too vague to be certain that it will include digital currencies.

Roland Sun of ChinaLedger told CoinDesk that although the proposed definition could be expanded to include digital currencies, he said there is a ""long way to go"" before such a legal definition could be enacted.

Sun told CoinDesk:

""I don’t expect a firm legislative recognition of the property rights of cryptocurrency [holders] in the next five or six years.""

Despite these reservations, the Chinese government, so far, has not denied that digital currencies would be included in the new law.

The Chinese constitution was amended in 2004 to introduce civil laws governing the individual’s rights to own personal property, including lawful income, housing, savings, household items, books, reference materials, trees and livestock. ",REGULATION,0.3818
2016/6/29,The Securities Law Implications of the DAO Hack and Proposed Ethereum Hard Fork,"The top five blockchain crowdsales bore out of the Bitcoin 2.0 movement have raised more than a quarter-of-a-billion dollars in “initial coin offerings,” “token sales” and the like. Participants contend the blockchain tokens are going “to the moon.” Others argue, since they’ve never been registered, they run afoul of securities law.

The second largest crowdsale and best known, is Ethereum at $18,439,086. Ethereum developers say their blockchain is a distributed smart-contract platform “fueled” by a native digital currency similar to Bitcoin. Ethereum’s 2014 “Ether sale” preceded it’s May 2016 crowdsale for the DAO, a so-called “decentralized autonomous organization” managed via Ethereum smart contracts.

Ethereum and DAO developers currently face scrutiny in the wake of a $55 million compromise of the DAO by an attacker. They are deciding whether to intervene and undo the damage done by the draining of funds. 

DAO token holders, who purchased the tokens with Ether, vote on “important decisions relating to the management of the DAO,” the project claims. The DAO had raised Ethereum worth over $200 million at the time of the attack. 

The top five blockchain crowdsales: the DAO, Ethereum, WAVES, Lisk, Digix and Augur, have raised approximately $200 million. Nearly $170 million of that is Ethereum and the DAO. 

Lisk, a cryptocurrency and decentralized application platform, raised $5,880,089 in an “initial coin offering” in 2016. Lisk founders worked on the code for three weeks before going public. 

“In the following three weeks we built up enough momentum to start our crowdfunding,” Lisk co-founder, Max Kordek, told me. The crowdfunding went on for one month and Lisk brought in more than 14,000 bitcoins. 

Kordek emphasizes the importance of marketing and calls Lisk’s “intensive marketing campaign” a “huge success.” 

Securities Law

Developers say they are providing access to software, not securities. The literature is littered with finance and security terms. Securities laws are broadly interpreted and designed to be adaptable to the innovative ways people raise funds. 

Congress developed federal securities law after the stock market crash of 1929. The speculative frenzy ending in the October 1929 panic, called “Black Thursday,”led Congress to enact the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1945 (the “Exchange Act”). 

State blue sky laws, Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations, as well as regulations from the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) combine to create securities law. 

SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. (1946) set the precedent that an investment contract entails the giving of money to others who manage and control the funds with the expectation of profit.

Blockchain crowdsales market that token holders and “community” participants themselves, enjoy management and control of the blockchain software. Indicating that they, themselves, help build the blockchain platform over time. DAO participants, for instance, use Ether toward the DAO projects they support. Lisk says that participants earn Lisk for bug bounties. 

If blockchain crowdsale participants enjoy management and control, then it’s arguably not an investment contract or security. Still, developers generally lack management and control over an enterprise in the real world.

Who would shareholders petition to obtain redress when something goes awry? Core developers on Ethereum, etc. argue that “smart contracts,” that is, the distributed software itself, handles everything.

Jason Seibert, a lawyer who serves on Bitcoin and securities cases, described a typical blockchain crowdsale: “Hey, give us some money and we are going to develop something. We are not quite sure what it is yet but when we do, you’ll be able to use this stuff for it, even though we don’t know what it is yet.”

Even if the blockchain crowdsales are, in fact, crowdsales and not securities offerings, they must still be registered under the JOBS Act and regulation. 

Illustrating the nuance of securities laws, Seibert evokes baseball cards:

“Nobody thinks baseball card manufacturers print baseball cards with the intent of them being an investment,” the Oregon-based lawyer, who represented Trendon Shavers in the first Bitcoin criminal fraud case in the U.S., said. “Come on, it’s sold in a pack of gum! But everyone knows that people can collect them and trade them and make money off of them.” 

Blockchain crowdsales come across much differently. They’re not bubble gum and pictures of athletes. “We’re talking about an investment opportunity,” Seibert says. 

Heretofore, blockchain crowdsales have enjoyed the unwritten “good deal exception,” wherein, since everybody is happy, nobody files lawsuits or tips off relevant officials. 

That the DAO smart contract platform was drained of $55 million and core Ethereum developers are considering implementing a fork to roll back the perceived heist, it remains to be seen if the “good deal exception” will soon expire. An SEC official commented June 20 that the $55 million attack against Ethereum underscores concerns over blockchain systems.

Thanks to the DAOs code, Ethereum developers could intervene and undo the $55 million drain. But that might be used in a court against them as proof they held control over Ethereum and the DAO. The DAO would not have truly been a “decentralized autonomous organism,” as advertised, and participants could then be seen as misled investors. 

“You’ll generally hear an investor say, ‘Had I know this-or-that, perhaps I would not have invested,” Seibert explained. ",REGULATION,0.2023
2016/7/13,New EU Directive May Impose Anti-Money Laundering Regulations on Bitcoin Wallet Providers,"The European Commission published a new directive draft last week proposing to extend strict anti-money laundering (AML) regulation to both virtual currency exchange services and custodial wallet providers. Intended to counter “money launderers, tax evaders, terrorists, fraudsters and other criminals,” the directive could mean that many Bitcoin companies in the E.U. will have to apply know your customer (KYC) types of checks on their users.

The proposal, which particularly focuses on terrorist financing, intends to restrict the anonymous use of virtual currencies, presumably referring to bitcoin and altcoins.

According to the draft published by the executive arm of the European Union:

“Transactions with virtual currencies benefit from a higher degree of anonymity than classical financial fund transfers and therefore entail a risk that virtual currency may be used by terrorist organizations to conceal financial transfers. Possible further risks relate to the irreversibility of transactions, means of dealing with fraudulent operations, the opaque and technologically complex nature of the industry, and the lack of regulatory safeguards.”

As such, the European Commission recommends that existing anti-money laundering regulation should apply to virtual currency services, and, in particular, to exchanges and custodial wallet providers.

The European Commission writes:

“[T]o prevent misuse of virtual currencies for money laundering and terrorist financing purposes, the Commission proposes to bring virtual currency exchange platforms and custodian wallet providers under the scope of the Anti-Money Laundering Directive. These entities will have to apply customer due diligence controls when exchanging virtual for real currencies, ending the anonymity associated with such exchanges.”

If adopted, Bitcoin companies will be required to collect their customers’ identity documents; something several of them already do, though it is currently not mandatory. (In some cases financial partners ‒ such as banks ‒ do require Bitcoin companies to apply KYC in order to get an account.) Additionally, Bitcoin companies will need to monitor transactions on their platforms and report suspicious activity.

Interpretation

The proposal does not go into detail explaining which kinds of services will be affected. It's clear that the directive would apply to Bitcoin exchanges and wallet services that control customer funds. Whether it also includes exchanges or wallet providers that do not hold onto private keys, or not all private keys in case of multisig-addresses, is not as clear. (EDCAB’s Siân Jones thinks it might; Coin Center's Jerry Brito thinks not.)

The European Commission, which says that the directive is drafted in accordance with “relevant virtual currencies market players,” including “exchange platforms, wallet providers [and] a representative group of virtual currency stakeholders,” maintains that the regulation should not hamper virtual currency adoption – and perhaps might even further it.

The draft proposal reads:

“The proposed measure has no negative effects on the benefits and technological advances presented by the distributed ledger technology underlying virtual currencies. […] The credibility of virtual currencies will not rise if they are used for criminal purposes. In this context, anonymity will become more a hindrance than an asset for virtual currencies taking up and their potential benefits to spread.”

Individual Users

For now, the directive targets only exchanges and wallet providers – not individual Bitcoin users. Toward the end of the document, however, the European Commission acknowledges that regulating exchanges and wallet providers may ultimately not suffice to prevent nefarious use of virtual currencies. After all, Bitcoin users can run wallet software on their own computer or smartphone, thereby not requiring any wallet provider at all.

The draft therefore suggests that addresses may have to be tied to individual users at some point in the future as well:

“The inclusion of virtual exchange platforms and custodian wallet providers will not entirely address the issue of anonymity attached to virtual currency transactions, as a large part of the virtual currency environment will remain anonymous because users can also transact without exchange platforms or custodian wallet providers. To combat the risks related to the anonymity, national Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) should be able to associate virtual currency addresses to the identity of the owner of virtual currencies. In addition, the possibility to allow users to self-declare to designated authorities on a voluntary basis should be further assessed.”

The proposal must still be approved by the European Parliament and member states, and could be enforced as soon as January 1, 2017. Once approved, EU member states are expected to implement national laws based on the directive.

2016/7/14,Dutch Bitcoin Companies Start Initiative to Adjust Proposed European Union AML-Directive,"The European Commission published a draft directive last week proposing to amend existing anti-money laundering rules to include virtual currencies such as bitcoin. If adopted, exchanges as well as custodial wallet providers will need to collect customers’ identity documents and report suspicious activity on their platform to relevant authorities.

In an attempt to avoid regulatory overreach, a group of Dutch Bitcoin startups and experts is now reaching out to the Dutch Ministry of FInance offering their expertise, hoping to potentially adjust the proposed directive amendment.

Uncertainty still exists over the extent of the proposed directive; in particular over what are considered “wallet providers offering custodial services of credentials necessary to access virtual currencies.”

Some legal experts maintain that the amendment would concern only companies that fully control customer funds (such as Circle or Xapo). Other legal experts think it may also apply to wallet providers that merely hold onto a single key of a multisig-address (such as BlockTrail or GreenAddress); an interpretation that was confirmed by German Bitcoin-news site bitcoinblog.de, which reportedly spoke with an E.U.-representative.

Additionally, Bitcoin-services that are not really designed as wallets but do hold private keys (such as ChangeTip and SatoshiPay), may fall under the new regulation as well.

Jouke Hofman is CEO of Bitcoin-brokerage Bitonic and exchange BL3P and initiated the outreach to the Dutch Ministry of Finance as well as Dutch Bitcoin-startups and experts.

Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Hofman explained:

“Under the current provision, it's not that clear who or what the regulation applies to, exactly. It covers wallet providers that hold onto private keys of their users. But does it also include wallet providers that hold onto one key for a two-of-three multisig address? What if bitcoins are time-locked and wallet providers cannot spend the funds now, but perhaps in the future? And if the regulation applies to any key holder, where does the definition of a wallet provider begin? Could the regulation perhaps even apply to Lightning Network nodes? It's important these types of nuances are taken into account when drafting new regulation for an upcoming technology that's still very much in development.”

This sentiment is shared by Corné Plooy, the main developer behind Amiko Pay, a payment channel network sharing similarities with the Lightning Network. As part of the initiative, Plooy is reaching out to the Dutch Ministry of Finance in hopes of giving them a better understanding of the technological potential of the Bitcoin protocol – and possible consequences of regulatory overreach.

Explaining his perspective to Bitcoin Magazine, Plooy said:

“A major difference between financial technology and other information technology like software or websites is that financial technology usually cannot be deployed without approval of existing parties like banks. I believe this is what stops the financial sector from having the same level of innovation as other IT-sectors. This is where Bitcoin makes a huge difference. It allows for a peer-to-peer economy, without dependence on large organizations. There is no longer a strong separation between the role of a consumer and that of a service provider. Anyone with a good idea and a bit of expertise can make their idea a reality, giving a huge boost to fintech innovation.”

He continued:

“Regulation may destroy that advantage. What would have become of Google if it had to perform a suspicious activities check on every website it linked to? What will happen to the Lightning Network if every user has to comply with AML/KYC regulations? That is a real concern if multisig key holders are considered wallet providers in the newly proposed E.U. regulations. Privacy concerns aside, individuals don't have the resources to apply these sorts of checks.”

If the directive is adopted without sufficient provisions for startups and room for innovation, Hofman and Plooy, who are accompanied by representatives from BlockTrail and Bitmymoney, worry it will stifle Bitcoin innovation – or drive that same innovation out of the European Union. They maintain that any regulation targeted at wallet providers should be withheld for now, and they prefer a so-called “wait and see” approach in this domain.

“The core issue is that regulation cannot take into account the advantages or demands of future inventions, because we don't know what those future inventions will be,” Plooy explained. “We need a space where new ideas can be deployed, where they can grow in freedom, so they can prove their use to the world. If the E.U. doesn't provide that space, innovation will happen elsewhere, and Europe will always stay behind.”

On top of that, the initiative questions whether the proposed regulation will accomplish the stated goals in the first place. In the directive draft, the European Commission argues it needs to impose KYC-checks on the gatekeepers of virtual currencies in order to prevent criminal abuse. But since Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer protocol by design, it's unclear that regulating specific types of wallet services will have any effect in that regard at all, they argue.

“We concede that on- and off-ramps – the exchanges and brokerages where Bitcoin is traded for fiat currency and back – can be considered gatekeepers of the system. We also understand these may need to be regulated to some extent,” Hofman explained. “But this directive proposes to apply full KYC/AML-checks on certain wallet providers. We don't believe these companies work as gatekeepers at all, since anyone can trivially send, receive and store Bitcoin without these companies anyway. They're service providers, sure – but not gatekeepers.”

As the initiative limits itself to reaching out to Dutch policymakers, Hofman hopes Bitcoin industry players in other E.U. member states undertake similar steps. He has been reaching out to several of them over the past week, suggesting they may want to take action as well.

“In the end, I think it is mostly a lack of understanding of the underlying principles of Bitcoin – and in particular the pay-scripts – that had the European Commission come up with this phrasing,”  Hofman said. “But since it is a draft, there are still ways to alter the content. All E.U. member states will have input on the paper, so other European companies that believe the directive needs to be adjusted should contact relevant government officials and perhaps offer them their knowledge. I don't know for sure if this will actually help, but at least we need to try.”

The European Parliament and the European Council must approve of the directive for it to be adopted. If any adjustments are to be made to the draft proposal, it will need to happen on short notice for regulatory standards: The proposal is scheduled to be enforced by 2017, while the council will discuss the draft as early as next week. Once adopted, E.U. member states are expected to implement national laws based on the directive.",REGULATION,0.9969
2016/7/28,Canadian Banks Experiment With Blockchain Technology; Fintech Sector Calls for Regulatory Certainty,"Canada’s central bank, the Bank of Canada, and five other Canadian banks (like a growing number of banks around the world) are experimenting with blockchain technology and a possible digital dollar as the growing demand for digital fintech payment systems puts the squeeze on the traditional banking sector.

At a recent IMF/World Bank conference hosted by the U.S. Federal Reserve, an estimated 90 central banks, including the Bank of Canada, came forward to talk about their research into and experiments with distributed ledger technology (DLT), the blockchain and digital currencies.

The big Canadian banks are also members of the R3 Consortium, which is working with 50 member banks worldwide, developing a foolproof methodology and standard for blockchain technologies for banks.

 The Bank of Canada is cautious in commenting on its digital money experiments but is adamant that this is just an experiment and nothing more.

Martin Bégin, a representative speaking for the Bank of Canada, told Bitcoin Magazine:

“What was referred to as CAD-coin is just a means of representing settlement balances on the distributed ledger, like a deposit receipt. It could also be called ‘deposit-coin’ or ‘settlement-coin.’ It doesn’t exist as a medium of exchange outside the experimental wholesale payment system. Our only goal at this stage is to understand the mechanics, limits and possibilities of this technology.”  

Bégin said that the Bank of Canada chose to experiment with Ethereum because the members were the most familiar and experienced with coding on that platform.

“This particular project is one part of a larger Bank of Canada work plan to investigate the distributed ledger technology and better understand its characteristics,” he said. “We may look at other platforms going forward.”

According to Bégin, the greater potential for DTL lies beyond the Bitcoin blockchain, in applications outside of digital currencies.

“Fintech is an important part of the Bank’s research agenda, and this not a coincidence,” he said. “There are many benefits of fintech, but realizing those, while guarding against the risks it could create, will require strong collaboration among policymakers, incumbent financial institutions and new entrants. For the Bank of Canada, one of the best ways to really understand this technology is to build and experiment with it, in conjunction with the industry. It’s our job to be forward-looking.”

 Fintech Experts: Regulatory Uncertainty is Stifling Fintech Development in Canada

Meanwhile the Canadian Money Service Business Association (CMSBA), representing more than 800 MSBs, is petitioning the federal government’s Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), the agency responsible for regulating fintech, to clearly define money services businesses to include digital currencies businesses.

Amber D. Scott, CEO of Outlier Solutions, told Bitcoin Magazine:

“There are few Canadian banks that will deal with Bitcoin companies, and in some instances only if those companies are registered as MSBs with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC).”

The CMSBA sent a letter to Canada’s Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) recently, saying members have had their bank accounts closed in “what appears to be a sector-wide sweep even though they are compliant with all anti-money laundering rules.”

In a regulatory Catch-22, as part of their “de-risking strategy,” banks need FINTRAC to define digital fintech startups as money services businesses before they can offer a business account.

“Regulators such as FINTRAC and the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) are known to have relatively negative views of MSBs (whether this is organization-wide or the bias of some examiners I cannot say),” said Scott, “which makes me wonder if the MSB designation will do more harm than good when it comes to the ability of Bitcoin companies to access the traditional financial system.

“Even if our regulatory regime nets out favorably (and I hope that it does), access to banking may force companies to choose other jurisdictions. This is truly unfortunate as Canada has the potential to become a hub for fintech innovation — but we are rapidly depleting any advantages that we once had.”

The Financial Post reports that recently an unidentified bank was fined $1.1 million by FINTRAC for providing accounts to money service businesses and that an apparent crackdown is making it harder for fintech companies to get bank accounts.

FINTRAC, on the other hand, is stalling on defining Bitcoin and digital currencies businesses as “Money Services Businesses” leaving the fintech startups in a Catch-22 between the banks and regulators.

In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Kyle Kemper, Executive Director of the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, noted the need for the Canadian Bitcoin community to advocate for progress. “At this point the lobby for crypto pales in comparison to the banking and payments lobby. A course of inaction could lead to a greater movement away from the fiat in general as crypto solution providers' solutions become more robust, frictionless, and adopted.”

Coinbase Bumps Up Against Canada’s Regulatory Uncertainty

Coinbase, one of the world’s most successful Bitcoin companies, recently notified its Canadian customers that it was withdrawing from the Canadian market and could no longer support transactions in Canadian dollars.

At the same time, the company was setting up in Japan and had recently expanded to Australia, making it the 33rd country served by Coinbase.

Fred Ehrsam, president and co-founder of Coinbase, said in a recent Reddit AMA:

“Our mission is to create an open financial system for the world and part of that is making digital currency as easy to access, in as many countries as possible. So it makes me sad that we've had an interruption there [in Canada]. The goal is to get it back online when we have a good payment service provider or bank in Canada. A bunch proactively reached out when that news went out, so hopefully we will get a good replacement soon.”

“The fact that they [Coinbase] struggle with one of the primary pillars of being an exchange, being able to process fiat withdrawals and deposits, shows that Canada is difficult environment for Bitcoin Fintech companies to operate in,” said Kemper.

Bank of Canada Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins noted recently that what she calls “traditional trusted intermediaries” may be replaced by more convenient technologies; however, she doesn’t believe that Canada’s regulatory body is lagging behind.

“Fintech regulators also face the difficult challenge of balancing the need to ensure the safety and soundness of the financial markets against the need to encourage further innovation,” she said.

“The regulatory framework needs to adapt so that the door is not opened to unmanaged financial and operational risks, unchecked critical dependencies within our financial system and moral hazard. Promoting financial stability is a core function of the Bank of Canada, and we take a system-wide perspective when we monitor risks.”

According to Scott, however, the system is set up in such a way that many companies are having a difficult time playing by all the rules, all the time.

“In many ways, the banks are acting as both gatekeepers and de facto regulators, which is truly unfortunate. We've spoken with the CEO of a company who asked a bank that had committed to investing $1 million if the bank would open a business account for them and the answer was ‘no.’ It's completely baffling to me that a bank would be willing to invest money in a business but not provide an operating account for that business.”

Scott noted that MSBs and fintech companies are sometimes afraid to go on record because they don't want to lose their existing bank accounts, including accounts that may have been opened covertly under the guise of software companies or numbered companies.

“Banks and credit unions are afraid to open accounts or to keep them open, since they face pressure from FINTRAC and OSFI to treat all of these accounts as high risk (which is not a regulatory requirement) or to close them,” said Scott.

“These tactics are directly driving risky behavior,” she added. “Ultimately, the only ones winning at this game are criminals, because legitimate businesses are being forced to act evasively, which in turn, makes illicit activity more difficult to identify.”",REGULATION,0.25
2016/8/1,"Without Unified, Federal Regulations for Digital Currencies, the U.S. Risks Falling Behind","The divided regulatory policies and frameworks on digital currencies, including Bitcoin, in the United States have created an impractical ecosystem for startups to operate in.

The country’s state-by-state regulations for money transmission licensing has led to an unclear regulatory framework for digital currencies, with some states, including North Carolina, New Jersey and California, establishing regulations in favor of digital currency startups and businesses, while others, such as New York and Connecticut, require startups to obtain expensive licenses to operate as legal entities.

This rules-based approach from government agencies has made it virtually impossible for digital currency startups to be compliant with each state’s regulations, resulting in the termination of services in some states.

In response to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s request for comment, Coin Center, a Washington-based, non-profit cryptocurrency research center asked for the development of a federal charter that would create a unified lightweight, limited purpose regulatory framework for fintech and digital currencies in the United States.

“How can [we] facilitate responsible innovation by institutions of all sizes?” the OCC asked in its white paper.

Coin Center suggests that a simple answer and approach to this core issue of innovation is to enable fintech and virtual currency startups to obtain a passport to offer cross-state services throughout the nation, without dealing with state-independent regulations on money transmission.

The elimination of barriers between states will additionally open fintech startups to numerous payment and financial systems which they can use to obtain banking services. Reflecting on the concept of open network introduced by the OCC in its white paper, it is only logical to offer an open regulatory environment for fintech startups that are focused on bringing innovative and disruptive financial services to the country.

The OCC, an independent bureau within the Treasury Department, holds the ability to regulate and supervise all national banks and the federal branches of foreign banks in the United States. Thus, the OCC is one of the few government organizations that possesses authority over independent states and their regulations on money transmission.

If the OCC is as committed to innovation and development of open network technology as it says in its white paper, it should maximize its resources to lead each state in creating a viable ecosystem for fintech companies to operate in, similar to the regulatory environment of the United Kingdom.

The U.K. and its regulatory bodies have persistently opted for favorable policies for fintech and digital currency startups since early 2015, after realizing the market for and importance of fintech to the economy of the nation.

Its government took an alternative approach, establishing  different regulations for businesses in the fintech industry in order to enable the fintech sector to operate and prosper.

“Our interviews suggested the U.K. government should consider additional actions to support the Fintech community, particularly in the areas of improving access to talent; encouraging closer collaboration and information sharing between established financial services businesses and Emergent Fintech; and actively championing the sector,” states an official report commissioned by U.K. Trade and Investment.

Apart from local regulatory policies, the U.K. government and its agencies including the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) went as far as securing partnerships with other global organizations in South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong to improve its fintech market and position itself as the leading nation in financial technologies.

Singapore and South Korea, for instance, have partnered with the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority to create a bridge between Singaporean and South Korean fintech startups with the British. The partnership established a friendly ecosystem for fintech startups to discuss emerging technologies and the latest trends in the market. With this program, and favorable regulations from the federal government, Singapore and South Korea have quickly escalated as the leaders of the Asian fintech and blockchain industries.

Furthermore, European countries such as Switzerland and Germany also have begun to develop friendly regulations for fintech startups, recognizing their significant impact to their economies. As a result, German fintech companies received more venture capital funding than startups in London and the United States, securing more than $1.6 billion in investment.

The Swiss Federal Tax Administration’s announcement in mid-2015 that it was eliminating value-added tax (VAT) for Bitcoin spurred interest among investors and venture capital firms, enabling fintech startups to secure large sums of funding from local investors.

Considering the potential of fintech and its rapid growth in the American and global markets, the United States and the OCC should follow the lead of countries such as the U.K. and encourage the government to establish regulatory policies that won’t leave the fintech industry lagging behind their global competitors.",REGULATION,-0.5972
2016/8/3,E.U. Representatives Clarify the Proposed Anti-Money Laundering Directive,"Last month, the European Commission published a draft directive proposing to extend anti-money laundering (AML) regulation to both virtual currency exchange services and custodial wallet providers. The draft suggests that many Bitcoin companies operating within the European Union will need to apply know-your-customer (KYC) types of checks on their users, to be enforced by 2017.

Phrasing of the directive left some uncertainty over its extent, however —in particular over what are considered “wallet providers offering custodial services of credentials necessary to access virtual currencies.”

For clarification, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to E.U. representatives.

Intent

Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, the E.U. representatives (who preferred not to be mentioned by name or quoted directly) explained that the concept and motive of the proposal is straightforward.

From the perspective of the European Commission, virtual currencies present a problem as they allow money to circulate easily, and it's difficult to know who's transacting with whom. To address this, the E.U. wants to set up checkpoints: Custodian wallet providers and exchange services would be required to monitor transactions on their platform and report suspicious activity.

Within that context, the representatives acknowledged that the proposed regulation should not apply to any services that happen to hold onto customer private keys. There is, for instance, no intention to regulate Lightning Network nodes or mining pool operators.

Custodial wallet providers, under the provision, are wallet providers that hold onto at least one private key for customers. Naturally, that includes wallet providers that hold full control over users' private keys, such as Circle and Xapo. But it also includes services that hold onto a single key in a multi-signature setup, even if they can't spend on behalf of customers, such as GreenAddress or Blocktrail. Wallet providers that do not hold any private keys at all — like Mycelium or Blockchain — would not fall under the provision.

The E.U. representatives also indicated there might be further discussion on a potential minimum threshold. Under the current proposal, any custodial wallet provider, as well as exchange service, would be required to apply AML/KYC checks on customers — even for trivial amounts. The representatives indicated this may be reconsidered to perhaps introduce a minimum threshold under which no identity verification would be required. (But this is not guaranteed.)

Anonymity

Another part of the draft directive that garnered attention is a paragraph pertaining to future research. Specifically, the European Commission suggests that users and Bitcoin addresses may have to be able to be linked to prevent nefarious use of the digital currency.

The draft directive reads:

“The inclusion of virtual exchange platforms and custodian wallet providers will not entirely address the issue of anonymity attached to virtual currency transactions, as a large part of the virtual currency environment will remain anonymous because users can also transact without exchange platforms or custodian wallet providers. To combat the risks related to the anonymity, national Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) should be able to associate virtual currency addresses to the identity of the owner of virtual currencies. In addition, the possibility to allow users to self-declare to designated authorities on a voluntary basis should be further assessed.”

Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, the E.U. representatives acknowledged that these ideas will be further assessed — but not any time soon. Specifically, a report scheduled for 2019 will explore the options and potentially make recommendations.

Moreover, as specified in the draft, the intent at this point is merely to allow users a voluntary choice to self-declare addresses. The E.U. representatives confirmed that there are as of yet no plans to make non-declaration illegal. The representatives suggested that users may choose to self-declare their addresses, however, in order to increase the credibility and use of virtual currencies, as their anonymous nature can be seen as a threat.

The legislative proposal is currently in the preliminary discussion phase; there may still be modifications at both the European Parliament and the European Council levels. At least one initiative, coming from the Netherlands, has been started to adjust the proposal, most importantly removing KYC/AML requirements for wallet providers.",REGULATION,-0.7657
2016/9/15,European Banking Authority Proposes Virtual Currency-Specific Regulatory Body,"The European Banking Authority (EBA) has advised that the European Commission establish a regulatory regime specific to virtual currencies such as bitcoin. Commenting on the commission’s proposal to amend the existing European anti-money laundering directive, the EBA expresses the opinion that, in the long term, oversight of digital currencies should not fall under regular anti-money laundering provisions, but rather under a specialized EU body.

In a response to the commission published by the EBA in August 2016, the banking authority suggests that the existing anti-money laundering directive is “currently not suitable for mitigating all the risks arising from [virtual currency] transactions. Instead, a separate regulatory regime, or more far-reaching amendments [...] would be required.”

Impact on Bitcoin Addresses and Miners

In July 2016, the European Commission published a draft directive, proposing to extend strict anti-money laundering (AML) regulations and “countering the financing of terrorism” (CFT) measures to Bitcoin service providers. Specifically, the directive would apply to virtual currency exchange services and custodial wallet providers.

The draft directive also hinted that further regulation may be required in the future to perhaps include Bitcoin address-ownership. The EBA’s response indicates agreement with that assessment and suggests that mining should be subject to oversight as well, stating:

“[Virtual currencies] incur additional, technology-specific risks that make them distinct from conventional fiat currencies that are in the scope of [the existing anti-money laundering directive]. So-called ‘51 percent attacks,’ for example, are one such risk, [constituting] a scenario in which a pool of miners attains 51 percent of the computational power with which units of a particular [virtual currency] scheme are mined, which in turn allows that pool to block transactions.”

The banking authority therefore says that an amendment to the current anti-money laundering directive may not suffice in the longer term. It argues in favor of the installment of a special regulatory body for virtual currencies in the future.

EU Directive

Even though the EBA advises that the commission should establish a regulatory regime specific to virtual currencies, it does generally support the proposed amendment to the existing anti-money laundering directive. As the establishment of a new regulatory regime would take a significant amount of time, the amendment proposal serves as a good intermediary step.

“Such a regulatory regime […] would require several years to develop, consult, finalise and transpose, and is therefore not an option, given the short time frame within which the Commission was asked to develop its proposals,” writes the EBA. “It may therefore be advisable for the Commission and co-legislators to initiate as soon as possible the comprehensive analysis that is needed for assessing which, if any, regulatory regime would be most suitable for [virtual currency] transactions.”

The EBA does, however, suggest that the draft directive requires some refinement. In particular, the banking authority points out that both the European authorities as well as digital currency companies operating in Europe should be well-prepared to deal with new legislation. This might require some additional time before the new directive can applied.

According to the EBA:

“[I]n order for these amendments to reduce the risk of virtual currencies being abused for money laundering or terrorist financing purposes, the Commission and co-legislators should ensure that competent authorities have the appropriate tools at their disposal to ensure the effective supervision of [custodial wallet providers’] and [virtual currency exchange platforms’] compliance with their AML/CFT obligations.”

The new directive is scheduled to be enforced by January 1, 2017, but the EBA believes that June 26, 2017, would be a more realistic goal.

Sharing Data

The EBA is also concerned about the international qualities of virtual currencies such as bitcoin.

An EU directive is itself not a law, but rather serves as a guideline for individual member states to draft national laws. This means that the resulting laws in any one member state may differ slightly from the others.

And since digital currencies live on the internet, and most service providers — like digital currency exchanges and custodial wallet providers — provide their services on the internet as well, state laws are easily circumvented, the EBA warns.

The EBA therefore recommends that different European member states will need to work closely together, noting that the risks can be tackled within all of the political union only if the relevant agencies in the different countries cooperate.

According to the EBA:

“It is [...] essential that competent authorities from different member states are able to liaise and exchange information in relation to the operation of [virtual currency exchange platforms] and [custodial wallet providers] on their territory. […] The EBA therefore considers that the EU Commission and co-legislators should therefore introduce further amendments [...] to ensure that competent authorities responsible for the AML/CFT supervision [...] have gateways in place to exchange relevant information with one another.”",REGULATION,0.0772
2016/9/26,Kyckr’s Rob Leslie on Blockchain and Regulatory Compliance,"Compliance efforts are a tall task for many financial services and other organizations worldwide. New regulatory requirements are leading to greater demands to collect relevant client information before establishing a business relationship.

KYC (Know Your Customer), AML (Anti-Money Laundering), CTF (Counter-Terrorism Financing) and other labor intensive activities can have a chilling effect on business productivity and exact a huge cost. This is the result of voluminous amounts of customer data needing to be manually checked for accuracy, completeness, and duplications to ensure that targeted requirements are met.

Customer losses leading to a decline in revenue can result if these data gathering, onboarding, and client-lifecycle activities are inefficiently handled. An example of this is in the financial services industry where a customer may drop a banking relationship due to a lengthy credit decision process and more rapid competitor response. Moreover, slow manual processes have become prime targets for increased regulatory scrutiny and inspections, resulting in fines and even jail time for business leaders.

The need for advanced automation and real-time customer setup solutions has never been greater. One of the solutions being advanced are cost-effective, automated blockchain solutions for meeting regulatory demands tied with KYC, AML, and CTF. An emerging startup player in this space is the Ireland-based firm, Kyckr.

Taming the Compliance Jungle

Kyckr is a blockchain-centric solutions provider that delivers end-to-end compliance data sourced from over 150 business registers worldwide. Information captured and disseminated through the use of Kyckr’s verification API  is used by banks, financial institutions, payment solutions providers, accounting and law firms and other organizations to meet regulatory requirements, all with the goal of preventing criminal activities such as money laundering, terrorism, and fraud.

Kyckr’s beginning and evolution has been an interesting one. Rob Leslie, company founder and brainchild, spent his early career living in Japan working as an electronics engineer. After nearly 20 years, he returned to Ireland and was introduced to Ben Cronin, his eventual Kyckr co-founder.

During a coffee shop meeting in early 2007, Cronin mentioned an opportunity for the commercialization of compliance data via European Business Registers. Leslie thought it looked like an interesting idea, so they started a new initiative in March 2007, just as regulation was starting to drive changes. Their first sale was in December 2008, with data being delivered from 12 European registers. They now deliver data from over 155 registers around the world via their web portal and API.

Recently Kyckr announced a new, collaborative effort for its corporate identity blockchain service with Credits, a platform that provides distributed ledger technology software and cloud-based services. This move signals Kyckr’s commercial readiness to deliver an automated alternative to the prevailing model for capturing and employing compliance information.  The goal of this partnership is to become the best-in-class service for verified, secure and trusted corporate identity — a single source of truth.

Speaking with Bitcoin Magazine, Leslie described the current AML and KYC environments as complex and hard. “As Kyckr grows, we are seeing how we can apply automation to solving lots of tasks that are currently manual. This allows banks and other organizations to put their staff to work on the complex cases, instead of the vast majority of organizations, which are straightforward in their process.”  

He says that Kyckr has always held the view that to do KYC properly, information must be gathered from the authoritative source, which is the business register. “Nothing else should ever be accepted, as the provenance and veracity of the data cannot be guaranteed.”

Over the course of its evolution, Kyckr has also discovered that identity information, whether it be personal or corporate, does not naturally exist in aggregated databases. Rather it is stored in disparate places, requiring API connections to build complete identity profiles from primary sources.

Kyckr’s just-in-time element is likely to be viewed as its prized value proposition. Says Leslie: “We believe that real-time monitoring is needed to allow compliance to be maintained in real-time. Also, we think governments need to do more, as they have a duty to provide the means for identity to be verified, efficiently and quickly. To date, they have not done this well. Kyckr is aiming at making organizational access to the data easier in order to make the compliance process more efficient, faster and better for everyone.”

Leslie believes that Kyckr’s corporate identity blockchain will get a lot of attention as there is an increasing awareness of identity information serving as the root of everything.  “This verification process must be digital, secure, trusted and fast.  We will be looking at how we can support the rapid growth that is happening in this space when it comes to delivering digital trust by ensuring the availability of a solid trust anchor.”",REGULATION,-0.5574
2016/10/7,Interview: Dash and Coinfirm on Digital Currency Compliance Partnership,"The effective management of regulatory requirements is vital to the continued advancement of the digital currency industry. Dash, a privacy-centric, open-source, digital money ecosystem, has therefore chosen to integrate AML/KYC solutions designed to manage these concerns, in cooperation with blockchain compliance provider Coinfirm.

Some are hailing this move as a key milestone in addressing vulnerabilities tied to fraud and money laundering. Others are more skeptical, viewing it as potentially undermining Dash’s core tenets around privacy.  

Dash, viewed by its proponents as an enhanced version of Bitcoin, has garnered a great deal of media attention of late for its decentralized platform that allows digital cash to be spent online at merchants and service providers worldwide. Its features include instant transfers, low fees, and high levels of privacy and security.

As the seventh most valued digital currency, with an $82 million market cap, Dash’s self-funded, independently-governed community is comprised of over 15,000 users that facilitate over a million dollars in transactions every 24 hours. These transactions are verified by users through a global network of over 4000 master nodes.

Dash’s new collaborator, the London-based Coinfirm, is a risk and compliance platform offering compliance services for blockchain-based transactions. The platform employs proprietary algorithms that address AML/CFT, credit risk assessment, and other regulatory requirements pertaining to digital currencies. This gives institutions the ability to properly evaluate clients with speed and agility, ultimately allowing them greater access to new pools of clientele.

The Present Landscape

In the case of digital currencies like Dash, integrating with new product and service delivery models is a challenge.  With these regulation requirements varying across such a wide global geography, compliance often becomes a painstaking, complex and costly undertaking.

Coinfirm’s role is to navigate these linkages in a manner that allows Dash to work for the first time with commercial and financial institutions that are already subject to compliance requirements. Besides streamlining the onboarding process for new corporate clients, the Coinfirm platform will manage all ongoing AML monitoring by synchronizing with Dash’s blockchain network. Counterparty verification, risk assessments and fraud management are among the many deliverables that Coinfirm will provide on behalf of Dash.

In addition, Coinfirm will offer reports that allow Dash’s entrepreneur user base the ability to create their own verifiable Dash credit history and rating. As a result, this community will now have control of a faster track for launching new product and service offerings directed toward their strategic customer niche.

According to Coinfirm Co-founder and CEO Pawel Kuskowski, his firm’s partnership with Dash represents a major development in aligning the digital currency space with the larger world of commerce. “We believe that creating the first compliant digital currency ecosystem holds great significance, and will achieve broad acceptance by regulators, financial institutions, entities and individuals,” Kuskowski said to Bitcoin Magazine.

“This collaboration is the result of the immense benefits we can see, not just for our two firms, but for the entire blockchain, cryptocurrency and the financial system as a whole. This will set a standard, benchmark and precedent for the future, demonstrating how digital currencies and privacy can properly coexist, and strike a balance with the prevailing requirements of the financial world.”

Kuskowski believes that regulatory compliance is one of the key hurdles to overcome before the commercial and mass adoption of digital currencies can happen. “We've all seen how media coverage has portrayed some aspects of digital currencies over the years, and how the commercial and financial world has approached it. AML and compliance has been one of the main reasons why the two worlds haven't gelled yet, and is a large roadblock for entities already operating in the space. Our joint effort with Dash is a major move in addressing this.”

New Possibilities for Dash

Speaking with Bitcoin Magazine, Ryan Taylor, Director of Finance at Dash, says that this new collaborative effort with Coinfirm will open up potential opportunities to “expand into products and services that we haven’t been able to provide or integrate in the past. We’re super excited about this because it’s definitely a game changer in terms of what we can do moving forward.”

Taylor notes that nothing will fundamentally change with Dash’s core protocol, product and privacy elements as a result of this partnership. What this move addresses, he says, are efforts to build mass adoption through the addition of new products and services through various business partnerships.

Says Taylor: “I think there was a lot of early, negative reaction to all of this from both in and outside of our community — because the perception was that Dash was somehow being regulated. That’s not the case, however. We are simply seeking to greatly expand the number of businesses that integrate with Dash, most of whom already have to meet AML and KYC compliance requirements.

“Personally, I’ve already spent quite a bit of time on our public Slack channel yesterday answering questions and addressing what I see are knee-jerk reactions. A lot of users reacted very negatively to the media headlines without understanding the limits and full implications of what it is that we’re doing. I listened and once 95 percent of the users had their questions answered, they were much more comfortable with the direction we’re headed.”  

Taylor says that a user is affected only if they start interacting with a regulated businesses that Dash is partnered with. He offers this clarifying example:  “So if I receive bitcoin from someone else and then exchange those funds for Dash, I, as a user, would be unaffected. But if I wanted to buy or sell Dash directly on a site like Coinbase, I would have to go through Coinbase’s compliance requirements. This is true for any exchange or money transmitter that wants to provide a similar buy/sell option.”   

Compliance isn’t the only issue that Dash has been dealing with lately. Another is the recent decision by Apple to ban Dash from its app store.  

“We are very disappointed that Apple has chosen to filter certain currencies — including Dash at present,” said Taylor. “Apple is not highly transparent about the reasons why certain currencies are approved or not approved. That’s been frustrating for many of us in the cryptocurrency community. It makes it hard to figure out what exactly we should be working on.

“I think, though, that Apple is dealing with a rather difficult problem, as they have faced a lot of fraudulent wallets that have made their way into their app store, resulting in the loss of consumer funds. Apple is first and foremost interested in protecting consumers from this type of fraud. They also receive a ton of new wallet approval requests. So I think they’re struggling a bit to get their arms around this evolving ecosystem. My wish is that they would engage with the community more as a whole, and would communicate more clearly what the requirements are and what they evaluate when it comes to both currencies and wallets.”

At the end of the day, Taylor says that this compliance partnership with Coinfirm is ultimately about improving the overall ecosystem for Dash users. “We’re excited to work with Coinfirm because it really does open up a large number of doors for us in terms of opportunities to build our ecosystem. I think that firms in the digital currency space will be much more willing to work with Dash and consider us an option as a result of this. And what’s particularly exciting is, we can achieve this, while at the same time preserving all of the privacy features that make Dash so very compelling for the consumer.”  ",REGULATION,0.9968
2016/11/21,Bitcoin Transactions and American Taxation: An Interview With Daniel Winters,"The rise of bitcoin and other forms of digital currency is fueling a wealth of questions about tax enforcement: what sort of tax treatment guidelines exist for digital currencies? How are tax reporting agencies responding to the large number of digital currencies that now exist worldwide? To what extent is virtual money being used for tax avoidance purposes?

All of this has sparked fervent conversations among those being paid in bitcoin, those simply investing in it, and many of the anarcho-capitalist bent who view taxation as theft. And given prevailing issues around tax havens, offshore accounts, encryption and the Panama Paper revelations, many would argue that prevailing tax monitoring systems are prime for disruption.

In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, tax professional Daniel Winters, addressed ways to make sense of this increasingly complex U.S. taxation landscape. His boutique firm Global Tax Accountants is one of only a handful worldwide that focuses on the tax ramifications of digital currency and blockchain transactions.

Winter’s journey to this narrowly defined niche is an interesting one. Hearing about bitcoin’s growing popularity in 2013, he ponied up some money and purchased a tiny amount. He became fascinated with Bitcoin’s trustless, peer-to-peer system of exchanging value that exists completely outside of the control of central banks or government. Over time he began to explore how this movement might align with his work as a tax professional. Later, after reviewing the the guidance issued by the IRS on the taxation of virtual currencies in March of 2014, he elected to pivot his entire accounting practice last year toward the digital currency/blockchain niche  

Today, Daniel has over 30 clients that include investors, contractors and businesses that have bitcoin earnings. He has presented on bitcoin and taxes at the Texas Bitcoin Conference and the New York Bitcoin Center, and was interviewed by Bloomberg regarding New Jersey's tax treatment of bitcoin transactions.  

In the following interview, Winters discusses the road ahead, as U.S. tax authorities and users alike seek to better understand tax policy in the rapidly expanding digital currency landscape.

Is bitcoin considered money for tax purposes?

Per IRS Notice 2014-21, bitcoin is considered a virtual currency and is thus treated as property for federal tax purposes.  In other words, the IRS views bitcoin as being similar to stocks and bonds.  So under federal tax law, if you purchase bitcoin and later sell it, you will have a gain or loss on the transaction.

Bitcoin’s designation as a virtual currency connotes its use as a medium of exchange.  And the fact that it is traded on the market determines its value. However, as we know, it is not backed by any sovereign government and is not legal tender anywhere. So it functions as a currency, but only in the virtual world and electronically.

Where was the definition derived from?  

FinCen issued extensive guidance for the defining of digital currency. When the IRS issued their guidance in March 2014, they took the definition of a virtual currency directly from FinCen and then said okay, that is what virtual currency is and how it’s defined for tax purposes. Again the big takeaway from the IRS guidance is that bitcoin for tax purposes is property, not currency.

But given bitcoin’s global nature, why isn’t it considered a foreign currency?

The IRS does not view bitcoin as a foreign currency for tax purposes. Foreign currency has a different classification, and receives very different tax treatment.  In other words, bitcoin does not get treated the same way as if you bought some Euros in Germany and then had them converted into U.S. dollars.

And what’s with all of the talk about bitcoin being classified as a commodity?

There is a lot of misinformation out there about this. So for the record: bitcoin is also not treated as a commodity for tax purposes.  This confusion likely has ensued from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that regulates financial derivatives. They have stated that bitcoin is a commodity for purposes of the CFTC. The Commission was created many years ago to regulate financial products, such as futures contracts or derivatives for the price of soybeans, corn or pork bellies.  A derivative is basically a contract whose value is dependent on the price of something else, such as the price of soybeans. So the CFTC regulates financial derivatives and futures contracts. What they were trying to convey with regards to bitcoin is that it is also essentially a futures contract or derivative, which they are charged with regulating. But this [the CFTC] has nothing to do with taxation.

So why was it defined as a futures contract to begin with?

Basically, a futures contract allows you to purchase the right to buy or sell a commodity or other asset for a set price at a future point in time. These contracts were originally created for farmers, who wanted to guarantee the price of their crops. These days, you can buy a derivatives contract for a vast array of financial assets, including bitcoin. Therefore, when the CFTC issued their notice concerning bitcoin, this just meant that bitcoin derivatives contracts are being regulated by the CFTC. Again, bitcoin is most definitely not a commodity for tax purposes.  

So at the end of the day, is a bitcoin sale viewed in the same way as that of a stock?

Yes. Since Bitcoin sales are treated like stock sales, the resulting gain will be either short-term or long-term and subject to those respective tax rates. Long-term sales, for which bitcoin is held for more than one year, are subject to a 15 percent capital gains tax for most taxpayers. Taxpayers in the top income bracket are subject to a 20 percent capital gains tax, which applies to income above $415,050 for single taxpayers, and $466,950 for married taxpayers filing jointly.  Short-term sales are those for which bitcoin was held for up to one year and are subject to ordinary income rates of up to 39.6 percent.

How is all of this accounted for on a tax return?

With respect to bitcoin, there are two things that need to be reported on a tax return: income or revenue and any capital gains on the sale of those assets.

And how are capital gains calculated?

Capital gain/loss is calculated by subtracting the purchase price, or basis, of the virtual currency from the sale price. The basis of a given amount of virtual currency is the fair market value, in US dollars, on the date of payment or receipt.  

What that means for the average user is if they purchase $100 of bitcoin today, they own an asset with a cost basis of $100. Now let’s say that a year goes by and bitcoin goes through the moon, doubling in price. So it’s now worth $200. You then sell it and get $200. $200 minus $100 is $100 in capital gains, which must be reported on your tax return.

But there are some that say that bitcoin becomes non-taxable if you convert it before it appreciates.

That’s incorrect. If you receive $1,000 in bitcoin from, let’s say, a mining contract then you have $1,000 in income. And if it’s a business, it should be viewed as $1,000 of revenue. Bottom line, it’s $1,000 of ordinary income or revenue. But also keep in mind that it is also considered a capital asset, with a cost basis of $1,000. So unless you convert that bitcoin into dollars that day, you’re going to have a gain or a loss on the transaction.

How do the tax guidelines apply to bitcoin miners and their earnings?

The IRS says that if you are a miner that receives (bitcoin) revenue from a mining business, this equates to the U.S. dollar value of the virtual currency on the day you receive it. So as an example, say you are solo mining and you go a month and a half without getting paid. Then one day you suddenly become lucky and hit a big block with 12 coins. The complete dollar value of those revenues apply on the date you received them.

How are taxes viewed for a mining business?

Revenue reflects the dollar value of the bitcoin the business receives each day. Businesses can, however, reduce their revenues by any expenses they incur, irrespective of whether those expenses are paid in dollars converted from bitcoin or bitcoin itself. In other words, if you purchase a bunch of, say, power supplies for your mining business with bitcoin, your expenses are deductible.

What about bitcoin received in exchange for goods or services?

It is treated as ordinary income, the same as normal wages paid in fiat currency.

What about a miner or freelance contractor that receives their pay in bitcoin?

IRS stated very clearly that contractors who receive bitcoin or other forms of digital currency are subject to the 1099 reporting rule. That means that if you are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident and someone pays you in bitcoin, that company is obligated to provide a 1099 to you, provided that it was at least $600.

And W-2 employees?

If someone is a W-2 employee and their employer chooses to pay them in bitcoin, the IRS states that the dollar value of those wages gets added into any other dollars they’ve received during the year and that must be included on their end of the year tax document.  

The IRS just recently released a new guidance report in September. Can you briefly discuss this?

The IRS’ recent 31 page guidance report takes a broad look at bitcoin and virtual currency taxation, what the IRS has done so far to address it, and what they need to do in the future. The broad goals of this guidance are as follows: (1) determine if virtual currencies are widely being used as a method to hide income and avoid US taxation; (2) share virtual currency knowledge across the IRS; (3) identify audit techniques that can used to determine if taxpayers using virtual currencies in transactions, especially offshore arrangements, are attempting to conceal income and avoid US taxation.

Is this part of a larger enforcement effort?

Let’s just say that the IRS has a team charged with determining whether bitcoin is being used for tax evasion. This knowledge is being shared throughout the IRS and audit techniques are being identified to nail people who are hiding their income. They have given training to over 300 agents, providing a general overview of what virtual currency is and how it works.

The IRS is well aware that most people, many people, don’t properly report their bitcoin transactions and they are well aware of the fact that their enforcement mechanisms are not sufficient.

In your view how pervasive do you believe the use of bitcoin and other forms of digital currency will become as a tax-avoidance tool globally?

It's very difficult to answer that question.  Our firm doesn’t accept clients that are engaged in tax evasion. Bottom line, trying to use bitcoin to avoid paying taxes is not too smart. Since all bitcoin transactions are publicly available on the blockchain, if someone can associate your identity with a particular bitcoin address, your transactions are right there.

Any final advice for those who are actively investing and/or being paid in bitcoin?

Keep good records. This is particularly important given the history of instability among exchanges and the fact that they might go under at any moment. I get asked all the time about how likely it is that the IRS will detect tax avoidance. In my view, it is important to be compliant with the law and avoid any unnecessary complications with the tax authorities. That’s my passion: supporting people in achieving this aim.

2016/11/23,"IRS vs Coinbase: Massive Implications for Bitcoin, Digital Currencies","The recent Internal Revenue Service request to Coinbase, seeking records of customers who purchased virtual currency from 2013 to 2015, has led to a flurry of media attention both in the U.S. and worldwide. This action affecting America’s largest Bitcoin exchange — arguably the most comprehensive sweep of virtual currency for the purpose of identifying lawbreakers — has massive implications for the future of financial privacy and taxation.  

Documents filed by the IRS signal the agency’s intent to pursue both egregious tax evaders, as well as small, everyday users who use bitcoin and other forms of digital currency as a potential dodge for paying taxes. In the John Doe Summons, the IRS alleges that they have uncovered three instances where people have used bitcoin to evade taxes — two involving Coinbase customers. Based on these findings, the IRS. now surmises that many more people are utilizing digital currency for similar aims.  

This unprecedented action follows a Treasury Department Inspector General report, which casts blame on the IRS for failing to establish guidelines and take aggressive action to address what it believes to be unlawful activities on the part of digital currency users.

The request would require Coinbase to hand over the identity and full transaction records of millions of customers. The company immediately responded with a Protecting Customer Privacy notice on their website:

“Our customers may be aware that the U.S. government filed a civil petition yesterday in federal court seeking disclosure of all Coinbase U.S. customers' records over a three year period. The government has not alleged any wrongdoing on the part of Coinbase and its petition is predicated on sweeping statements that taxpayers may use virtual currency to evade taxes.

""Although Coinbase's general practice is to cooperate with properly targeted law enforcement inquiries, we are extremely concerned with the indiscriminate breadth of the government's request. Our customers’ privacy rights are important to us and our legal team is in the process of examining the government's petition. In its current form, we will oppose the government’s petition in court. We will continue to keep our customers informed on developments in this matter.”

By law, Coinbase and other companies that purchase and sell bitcoins are required by regulators to capture identifying information on users who initiate purchase and sell orders on their platforms. Because bitcoin transactions generally do not share the identities of the people involved, tracking the flow of funds has arisen as a concern for the IRS.

While guidelines for bitcoin users were established by the IRS in 2014, the tax agency has long alleged that is not receiving information from exchanges like Coinbase in order to ensure that proper tax payments are being captured.

This escalating development between the IRS and Coinbase could be a watershed moment for the future landscape of tax regulators, both in the U.S. and globally. Bitcoin evangelist and investor, Roger Ver, said to Bitcoin Magazine: “It seems very obvious that they (the IRS) are overstepping their already overly broad reach. It also makes me feel extra happy to not be American any longer, and to be a citizen of a country with a much more sane tax policy.”

As the regulatory parameters of bitcoin taxation are being examined, questions abound as to whether digital currencies are emerging as a preferred method for tax evaders, given the worldwide crackdown taking place on offshore banks and other tax havens. Tax authorities could eventually end up in a challenging scenario from a monitoring and enforcement standpoint, given the rapid proliferation of digital currencies like Monero and zCash that feature increasing levels of privacy, complexity and security. By some estimates, the number of online market trades is well over 700 and growing by the day. Online sites CoinMarketCap and CoinCap offer an overview of the expansive nature of the digital currency landscape.

Legal professional, Adella Toulon-Foerster, who spearheads the crypto/alternative currency practice at Cogent Law Group in Washington, D.C., told Bitcoin Magazine she believes the IRS's absurdly broad request is an obvious fishing expedition that in any sort of free society would never have passed the straight face test.  She also thinks that we are in the dark in terms of what will happen at the hands of a fickle judiciary that has often shown little regard for due process, and even less reluctance about unreasonable search and seizure.

But, she says, at least we know about this particular summons. “In an era of secret programs of mass surveillance, sneak and peek warrants, and secret courts that make 1984 look like a bedtime story, one can only imagine how little financial privacy bitcoin users really have, regardless of what is being made known to the public.”

That said, she offers the reminder that, by definition, the blockchain is a publicly viewable ledger. “Every transaction provides another thread of information that can lead to the identity of a bitcoin account holder. Ultimately, the Bitcoin blockchain is like a giant game of Sudoku that federal law enforcement has the manpower and computing resources to win.”

Perry Woodin, a computer engineer and CEO of the blockchain governance company, Node40, offered a couple of pragmatic solutions for simplifying this tax environment. First, he says, the IRS needs to clarify and update their tax guidelines so that they are more digestible for the consumer.

“Right now the IRS is looking to reduce noncompliance among all these people who have these cryptocurrencies or digital assets. Problem is, I don’t think most people quite know how they’re supposed to report in order to comply. The guidance is currently not very clear, particularly in terms of how to calculate gains and losses.”

This confusion ties to his second recommendation, which proposes the development of a software system or computer protocol that follows or establishes what the IRS uses for compliance guidelines, so that any user of, or investor in, digital currency can compile a report at the end of the fiscal year.

“It would allow the person to show unrealized gains and losses from their entire virtual currency portfolio, and hand it to their accountant in a format that is easily understood, consistent and accurate. This national standard would provide this information in a manner consistent with the customized Portfolio Insight Reports that Node40 provides to its DASH clients.”

Wooden believes that because the vast majority of all digital currency holdings are held in bitcoin, this was a logical place for the IRS to expand their U.S. enforcement efforts. “They wanted to go after bitcoin because that’s the big fish in terms of figuring out how to work with all of these compliance issues. Once they figure bitcoin out, they are just going to apply their findings to all of the other digital currencies.”

This is where things get a little tricky, according to Wooden. “All of this of course is tied to whether a particular cryptocurrency uses a transparent blockchain. zCash and Monero use an opaque blockchain and that means the only people who can verify a transaction on the blockchain are the parties to the transaction itself. So those people brazen enough to want to skirt this type of regulation would not only have to make use of a opaque blockchain, but would be subjected to having to live a full life of cryptocurrency without being able to ever cash out for fiat dollars. Because to do so the person would run the risk of being flagged.”

Given the IRS crackdown, Wooden advises that those involved with holding or trading digital currencies, or using them for day-to-day transactions, should begin carefully documenting their transactions. Eventually, tax compliance is going to require the collection of more information, and the more organized users are in terms of their assets, the easier things will be when that day comes. “If you’re just shifting assets all over the place, it’s going to be a major headache and a real nightmare to comply with the tax reporting agencies.”",REGULATION,0.9638
2016/12/5,"EU State-By-State Regulation of Bitcoin, Digital Currencies: What Are the Implications?","The European Commission’s recent decision to delay new anti-money laundering legislation by six-months is the latest in a string of new developments impacting digital currencies in the EU. This proposed directive which will now be pushed back to June 2017, proposes stricter controls around corporate entity structures and virtual currencies, with greater powers granted to tax authorities to investigate crimes. A January 25, 2017 vote of the European Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs has been scheduled before it moves on to a wider vote by the European Parliament.

Terrorist acts in Brussels and Paris, along with tax evasion concerns following the Panama Papers scandal, has led to calls by the European Commission for tightened oversight and regulatory due diligence for banks and financial services firms. Greater accountability and monitoring practices involving digital currencies and other forms of payment have been proposed in an attempt to mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The commission in particular has targeted bitcoin for increased attention, noting its ease of use in facilitating anonymous funds transactions for criminal purposes.

If enacted, this move would certainly create concerns among exchanges and wallet providers that foster transactions between fiat and virtual currencies as they would likely be required to turn over client lists to authorities. The commission is also exploring the possibility of establishing a mandatory (self declaratory) database of digital currency users to thwart digital money traders from masking their identity. These efforts at capturing user data mirror recent efforts by the U.S. Department of Treasury to identify users of the bitcoin exchange Coinbase.

In addition, national financial intelligence units charged with monitoring suspicious transactions and other data pertaining to money laundering will be issued more powers. This includes the ability to demand information from banking and financial services firms irrespective of whether reports of suspicious activity have been issued.

Finally, beneficial owners of business entities will be more closely watched for tax evasion purposes and would be subject to severe noncompliance penalties and fines.

Efforts at enacting regulatory controls are also afoot on a nation-by-nation basis. Germany and Austria are funding a project targeting financial crimes, again with an emphasis on digital currencies. Concerned about the proliferation of  digital currencies being used independent of central banks or other authorities, this collaborative effort known as BITCRIME will bring together funding from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the Austrian Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology (BMVIT).

Switzerland is also set to introduce legislation in 2017, which includes licensure for FinTech companies. There are also plans to establish a regulatory “sandbox,” or an innovation ecosystem, for firms involved in experimental early stage innovation projects. Moreover, the Financial Market Supervisory Authority which will serve as the primary regulator, plans to pursue deeper efforts aimed at understanding both digital currencies and blockchain technology.

Joe Ciccolo, Founder of the U.S. based BitAML, which provides regulatory compliance solutions for digital currency startups, sees various pockets of state-by-state regulation as anathema to the purpose of the EU. “State-level licensure has delayed growth and innovation in the United States, and has placed the country at a disadvantage when compared to its peers. The EU appears interested in raising its barriers to entry to match that of the U.S.”

He goes on to note that the U.S. and EU appear to be switching their trajectory on licensure. “In the U.S., regulators and lawyers have been working on piecing together a national license regime or limited charter to alleviate the burden of state-by-state licensing. Meanwhile, the EU appears to be transitioning from a single member-based licensing approach to a country-by-country approach.”

Paweł Kuskowski, CEO and Co-Founder of the compliance and verification platform Coinfirm is on the advisory board of the International Compliance Association, a group responsible for developing knowledge about rules and regulations regarding compliance and AML in Central and Eastern Europe, building international cooperation in the region. Kuskowski says that new EU regulations will put almost the same standards on digital currency entities as current standards for traditional financial concerns. He feels that the crypto and blockchain market is not ready to comply since compliance typically encompasses large investment and ongoing costs, if done in the traditional way. This, he notes, may mean that certain exchanges and wallets could be pushed out of the market.

Says Kuskowski: “In a lot of our discussions with clients and companies in the ecosystem we find that they are spending up to 25 percent of their time and pouring enormous amounts of money into compliance. This is not acceptable. At the end the day, businesses should be able to focus on doing business, serving clients, and developing new products as opposed doing compliance.”

Despite the challenges these developments are creating for the digital currency landscape, Kuskowski also believes that there is a case to be made for regulatory efforts aimed reducing criminal activity and keeping our world safe. “Whether we like it or not, the sector needs regulations to protect the customer and to limit money laundering and terrorist financing. This is a certainty and we see this in Europe with the EU AML Directive and we’re seeing it with the OCC and IRS. Despite having the effect of stunting and damaging the growth of the digital currency ecosystem and creating regulatory uncertainty, I do believe all of this will ultimately provide a clearer path towards commercial and institutional adoption and growth.”",REGULATION,0.9529
2017/1/11,"As India Goes Cashless, Both E-Money Stocks and Bitcoin Benefit","India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on November 9, 2016, that 500 and 1000 rupee notes would be taken out of circulation in an effort to reduce corruption, terrorism, black money and counterfeiting, and will no longer be accepted as legal tender in India. His surprise announcement caused chaos in the country as citizens scrambled to adjust to a new monetary norm that banned about 85 percent of cash in circulation.

This move was meant to bring billions of dollars worth of unaccounted money back into India’s economy. The Indian economy has thus far run primarily on cash transactions. This, in turn, has left a substantial proportion of India’s national income unaccounted for, as it doesn’t fall into the tax net. According to a research note by Ambit Capital Research, the size of India’s untaxed black market economy is worth $460 billion. In a “cashless” India, financial transactions will be more easily traceable, and previously unaccounted transactions will not fall through the net of the tax authorities.

The demonetization of the two highest-denomination notes in India has led to an increase in the use of electronic payment services and is a big step toward a cashless society. This, in turn, has two key benefactors: e-money payment companies and bitcoin.

E-Money Stocks Are Rallying

As reported by Bloomberg, e-money stocks have soared since Prime Minister Modi announced that he wants India to become a cashless society. India’s publicly listed electronic cash companies’ stock prices have surged in the wake of the currency reform in November. They are expected to continue to outperform since the government has introduced a range of discounts for making digital instead of cash payments.

Of the 23 e-payment solutions companies listed on India’s National Stock Exchange, 5 have been key outperformers since the new currency reform.

The stock prices of e-commerce software developers Intense Technologies Ltd. and Vedavaag Systems Ltd. increased by over 50 percent, while e-payment service provider RS Software India Ltd., technology solutions provider Aurionpro Solutions Ltd. and telecom solutions provider Tanla Solutions Ltd. have all rallied by over 20 percent.

On the day after the announcement, Credit Suisse Singapore made a strategic investment in Vakrangee Ltd., which provides digital financial services to governments and lenders, by buying 3.83 million shares in the firm and thereby signaling that it is prepared to bet on the profitable future of this sector in India.

A. K. Prabhakar, Head of Research at IDBI Capital in Mumbai, told Bloomberg that his team expects “double-digit revenues growth for e-governance firms over the next 3 to 4 years if the government systematically encourages cashless transactions” and that “growth in digital modes of payments will continue to be strong if the safety is increased and charges are reduced.”

According to the Reserve Bank of India, digital payments have increased by almost 50 percent from November to December, which shows that the shift toward a cashless economy is happening despite initial chaos in the country. This development will bode well for e-payment solutions providers and mobile money services.

Bitcoin Is Booming in India

India’s aggressive move toward becoming a cashless society, however, is not only benefiting e-money companies. It has also created a boom for bitcoin in the world’s seventh largest economy.

According to data compiled by Coin Dance, trading volumes at peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange LocalBitcoins has spiked aggressively in India since November 9, while leading Indian bitcoin exchanges Zebpay, Unocoin and Coinsecure are witnessing a surge of new users coming onto their platform to exchange rupees for bitcoins.

According to Zebpay Co-Founder Saurabh Agarwal, Zebpay’s trade volumes have increased by 25 percent from October to November; they have had 50,000 new users sign up to their exchange in the month of November alone, well above the usual 20,000 new-user increases they have experienced in previous months.

Coinsecure experienced a 300 percent increase in user sign-ups in November, while Unocoin had their user base increase threefold in the wake of India’s currency reform.  

While bitcoin merchant adoption is still next to none in India, the new currency reform and the subsequent push toward digital payments will give bitcoin a boost as a means of making online payments. More merchant adoption will also lead to more individuals adopting the digital currency, which, in turn, will help bitcoin flourish in India’s future cashless society.  ",REGULATION,0.4588
2017/1/26,"Stricter Bitcoin Regulation, Ban on Mixers Recommended at Interpol, Europol Conference","It appears the global fight against Bitcoin money laundering has turned up a notch.

Last week, more than 400 financial investigators from money laundering, cybercrime and financial intelligence units, as well as experts in asset recovery and relevant private sector representatives, met at the Global Conference on Countering Money Laundering and Digital Currencies in Qatar.

Held from January 16 to 18, 2017, the event was organized by the Working Group on Virtual Currencies. This is a joint initiative of Europol, the law enforcement agency of the European Union; Interpol, an intergovernmental organization facilitating international police cooperation; and the Basel Institute on Governance, an independent not-for-profit competence center specializing in financial crime.

According to the Basel Institute on Governance, the conference “aimed to provide law enforcement agencies and the private sector with the tools and understanding necessary to detect, counter and investigate criminal uses of virtual currencies.”

As a concrete result, attendees agreed on a list of shared recommendations.

Cracking Down on Bitcoin

Several of the recommendations specifically refer to Bitcoin and digital currencies, while others concern money laundering in general. If the recommendations are followed, they would significantly increase regulation of the digital currency space worldwide and make anonymous use of the digital currency much more difficult.

Perhaps most importantly, the recommendations suggest that bitcoin exchanges and wallet providers should be regulated in much the same way as the financial sector. While the digital currency space is still not officially regulated in many countries, background and identity checks through Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulation could become mandatory for anyone who wants to buy, sell or store bitcoin.

Additionally, bitcoin mixing services — which exchange bitcoins for different bitcoins to break the path to any particular piece of currency — are subject to several recommendations.

“All countries are advised to take action against Digital Currencies Mixers/Tumblers,” per a release from the Basel Institute on Governance. “Such services are designed exclusively to anonymize transactions and to make it impossible for Law Enforcement Agencies to detect and trace suspicious transactions. The existence of such companies should not continue to be tolerated.”

The recommendations also suggest that law enforcement agencies should cooperate across borders in identifying “suspicious Bitcoin addresses that threaten economic stability” and even that “unexplained wealth” should be considered a crime.

Connection to Cybercrime

The Working Group on Virtual Currencies was established in September of last year, in response to the popularity of digital currencies like bitcoin for illegal purposes.

In a 2015 report, Europol wrote that bitcoin was becoming the “common currency” for cybercriminals, accounting for over 40 percent of all identified criminal-to-criminal payments.

“Bitcoin is no longer used preferentially within Darknet marketplaces but is increasingly being adopted for other types of cybercrime as well,” the agency noted.

Examples include cryptoware like CryptoLocker and Curve-Tor-Bitcoin (malware that locks computers and demands a ransom to unlock it), DDoS extortion, commercial distribution of child abuse, credit card fraud and more.",REGULATION,-0.8481
2017/1/31,Will Trump’s New Policies Boost U.S.–Mexico Bitcoin Remittances?,"Last week, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to build a wall along the U.S.–Mexico border as he had promised during his presidential election campaign. Aside from the ethical and practical issues of building the border wall, the issue of how it will be financed was also raised by opponents during his campaign. Trump’s proposed solution to funding the wall is either to heavily tax U.S.–Mexico remittances or to fully prohibit them altogether, so that the funds needed to build the wall will stay in the U.S.

According to the World Bank, U.S.–based Mexican immigrants send around $26 billion annually to their families back home in Mexico. Trump’s proposed legislation would hit Mexican families that rely on remittances from their U.S.–based relatives hard. The Mexican economy would also suffer as the multibillion-dollar remittance inflow to Mexico adds substantially to the country’s domestic spending.     

In light of Trump’s proposed policies to fund the border wall, remittances from the U.S. to Mexico jumped to a ten-year high after Trump’s election win in November in anticipation of possible legislation restricting cross-border money transfers to Mexico. Remittances in the month of November jumped by almost 25 percent compared to the same month the prior year, according to data collated by the Mexican central bank.

Will Bitcoin Be the Answer if New Legislation Is Imposed?

If U.S.–Mexico remittances using traditional channels such as banks or large money transfer operators (MTOs), such as Western Union or MoneyGram, are to be heavily taxed or severely restricted, then bitcoin remittances could offer a solution.

Bitcoin allows users to send and receive money from and to anywhere in the world at a very low cost using online or mobile wallets to make the transfer. Furthermore, legal restrictions on money transfers could easily be circumvented using the digital currency, as no paperwork needs to be filed when sending money abroad. That way, both documented and undocumented Mexican immigrants would still be able to send money back home without any restrictions, should the new laws be put in place.   

Alternatively to bitcoin, anonymous digital currencies such as DASH, Monero or Zcash could also be used to make cross-border money transfers, should Trump decide to go through with his legislation and attempt to crack down on bitcoin remittances.

Bitcoin in Mexico

The main reason bitcoin hasn’t taken any notable market share of the $500 billion global remittance market is the challenge of transferring fiat currency into bitcoin and then bitcoin back into fiat currency without having to pay too much in bid/offer spread costs. Illiquid local exchanges in developing countries can easily hike up the cost of the remittance to the extent that it would make more sense to use traditional money transfer solutions.

Fortunately, for Mexican bitcoin users, there are several exchanges to choose from when needing to convert bitcoin into pesos or vice versa. Mexico’s main bitcoin exchanges include Bitso, Volabit and LocalBitcoins.

Given the liquidity of both U.S-based, Mexico-based and international exchanges that residents of the two nations have access to, the costs of converting bitcoin to and from fiat currency are reasonable low, making bitcoin remittances from the U.S. to Mexico a viable solution should Trump’s remittance restrictions be enforced. Furthermore, there are bitcoin remittance companies such as Abra and Cashaa that aim to make cashing out bitcoins in local fiat currency easier.  

In terms of bitcoin regulation, Mexico has taken a stance similar to many of its international peers. In April 2014, Mexico’s National Commission for the Protection and Defense of Users of Financial Services issued a warning on the risks of using bitcoin stating that it is not legal tender and not regulated by the Mexican authorities. Therefore, the commission warned, “any individual or business that uses or accepts virtual currencies as a means of payment does so at their own risk and on their own responsibility because the use of this type of asset entails high volatility and potential monetary losses.” In other words, bitcoin is not illegal but the commission warns against its use due to the risks involved in dealing in the digital currency.

Not surprisingly, following Trump’s election win in November, bitcoin trading volumes in Mexico on global peer-to-peer exchange LocalBitcoins and on the country’s leading bitcoin exchange, Bitso, increased substantially as Mexican bitcoin users moved funds away from the weakening peso and into a better-performing currency.

Should Trump succeed in imposing strict remittance restrictions from the U.S. to Mexico, this could become the first case study of bitcoin remittance succeeding and actually become a viable means to make cross-border payments.  ",REGULATION,0.4019
2017/2/2,"Dutch Tax Authority Clarifies: Bitcoin Mixing Will Not Be Banned, But Will Raise Suspicion","As the Dutch proverb goes: “The soup is not eaten as hot as it is served.” Meaning: The threat is often not carried through as thoroughly as initially presented.

Bitcoin Magazine recently reported that the investigative arm of the Dutch tax authority — the FIOD — wants to lower the bar for prosecution of unlicensed bitcoin traders. As part of that effort, the FIOD aims to have mixing services recognized as money-laundering indicators. Users of mixing services would be assumed guilty, Dutch financial newspaper Financieele Dagblad (FD) wrote, unless they could prove otherwise.

The FIOD has now nuanced these reports. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, the press officer for the tax authority explained that recognizing something as a money laundering indicator does not mean it will be illegal in and of itself.

“But it does mean it indicates money laundering,” he added.

Expanding on this reasoning, the press officer explained that the tax agency established a money-laundering typology that includes several factors.

These include, for example, the location where a transaction is made; a public space like a McDonald’s is more suspect than a regular office. “Similarly, whether or not the exchanger keeps an administration, what kind of compensation he charges, how the customer is verified, whether physical cash is used, the amounts involved, visibility of the exchanger on public websites or official government records, and whether communication happened in encrypted form,” the press officer said.

And soon, perhaps, also the use of bitcoin mixers.

Darknet Markets

Bitcoin can be used relatively anonymously. This has made the digital currency a popular means of exchange on darknet markets like AlphaBay and Silk Road, and is also increasingly used for other cybercrimes, such as ransomware. In a report published last year, Europol — the law enforcement agency of the European Union — said more than 40 percent of online transactions for illegal ends is made with bitcoin.

Darknet market merchants typically do exchange their earned bitcoins for fiat currencies. While trading bitcoin for fiat is itself not illegal in The Netherlands, most exchanges apply strict Anti–Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) standards. This is usually required by the banks they work with.

Darknet merchants, therefore, often prefer to exchange their bitcoins at what the FIOD refers to as “bitcoincashers”: exchanges and dealers that do not comply with such rules. They often offer their services via largely unregulated websites like LocalBitcoins.com, and typically meet up in person to trade bitcoins for cash fiat currency. These bitcoincashers then sell the bitcoins at a regular exchange or brokerage.

That’s where some bitcoincashers are caught. If they deposit large amounts and tick too many boxes in the above-mentioned money-laundering typology, an investigation can be started against them. And since all bitcoin transactions are traceable on the blockchain, in some cases, this investigation also leads to the original criminals and their crime.

That’s why bitcoincashers as well as the darknet merchants and cybercriminals increasingly make use of bitcoin mixers. On hosted sites, like bitmixer.io, these mixers exchange bitcoins for different bitcoins, to cut all links on the blockchain.

If these mixers themselves become a money-laundering indicator, using them would no longer shield the bitcoincashers as effectively.

Privacy

Within the Bitcoin community itself, many are concerned with the lack of privacy offered by Bitcoin. Not all bitcoin users want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own — even if they’re not breaking any laws.

As such, a series of new mixing instruments have been developed and designed over the past few years. These include JoinMarket, ValueShuffle and TumbleBit, while alternative digital currencies offering increased privacy, like Monero and Zcash, have gained in popularity too.

When asked by Bitcoin Magazine, the FIOD spokesperson did acknowledge that bitcoin mixing can also be done for perfectly valid, privacy-related reasons.

He noted, however, “We believe these use cases do not represent a majority. Compare it to the 500 euro note. This is legal tender (for now). However, when someone pays you with a 500 euro bill you are going to find that suspicious. We believe the same is true for mixing bitcoins.”",REGULATION,-0.6697
2017/2/6,Bitcoin Exempt from UAE Central Bank’s Ban on Virtual Currencies,"On January 1, 2017, the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) published a new framework covering digital payments in the country. According to the new “Regulatory Framework For Stored Values and Electronic Payment Systems,” which is applicable to all electronic payment services providers, “all Virtual Currencies (and any transactions thereof) are prohibited.”

In the new framework, the definition for virtual currencies that the central bank has identified is “any type of digital unit used as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a form of stored value.” This would suggest that bitcoin and other digital currencies have been officially banned by the UAE central bank as of January 1.

However, on February 1, Mubarak Rashed Khamis Al Mansouri, governor of the UAE central bank, informed Gulf News in a statement saying that “these regulations do not cover ‘virtual currency,’ which is defined as any type of digital unit used as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a form of stored value. In this context, these regulations do not apply to bitcoin or other digital currencies, currency exchanges, or underlying technology such as blockchain.”

He added that digital currencies are “currently under review by the Central Bank and new regulations will be issued as appropriate.”

In the statement, Governor Al Mansouri further highlighted that fintech development will play an integral role in the future of the UAE’s financial industry, which is the reason why the new framework was introduced at the beginning of the year.

While the new framework for e-payments and the confusion surrounding bitcoin regulations may sound worrying to some, the reality is that the UAE aims to become a leading center for blockchain innovation by 2020 and intends to become the first government to execute all of its transactions using the distributed ledger technology.

To achieve this goal, Dubai’s Crown Prince, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, launched the Dubai blockchain strategy to improve inefficiencies in governmental departments by eliminating paper transactions and by reducing the work hours involved in handling paper transactions. Furthermore, the blockchain strategy also aims to facilitate company incorporations for Emiratis, expats and foreign investors by creating a blockchain-based incorporation system.

As the UAE aims to become a leader in blockchain technology, it would be extremely surprising if its regulators would then stunt innovation in this area by restricting or prohibiting the use of digital currencies. Hence, any future bitcoin regulations in the UAE will most likely favor blockchain startups and the bitcoin economy.",REGULATION,-0.4939
2017/2/7,Venezuela Seems to Be Cracking Down on Bitcoin,"It appears that the Venezuelan authorities have had enough of Bitcoin. 

Over the past two weeks, police in the Latin American country arrested eight Bitcoin miners in three different cities. While some of them were accused of cybercrime and stealing energy, others were merely selling ASIC hardware. In addition to that, the country’s main exchange — Surbitcoin — had to halt operations, as the company’s bank closed their account.

While the country’s economy is in a state of turmoil, and the national currency — the bolivar — has been in hyperinflationary free fall for some time, the socialist regime in the Latin American country subsidizes electricity to the point where it’s almost free. As covered in a popular article published on reason.com last November, this has made Bitcoin mining popular among some tech-savvy Venezuelans. Even yields from older, secondhand hardware can provide a lifeline to order food products and medicines from outside of the country.

There is no official law against Bitcoin mining in Venezuela, and using the digital currency is legal too: travel agency Destinia even decided to ditch the bolivar and exclusively accept bitcoin. Regardless, as the country has been plagued by scarce electricity and regular blackouts, it appears that (ab)using the cheap energy for the purpose of Bitcoin mining does not go down well with local authorities.

In what was the biggest bust of the past couple weeks, the Policía Nacional Bolivariana (PNB) raided a warehouse in Valencia, the third-largest city in Venezuela. As reported by reason.com, the building hosted 11,000 ASIC miners, which allegedly consumed enough energy for an entire village. The arrested duo has been accused of stealing electricity, but also of cybercrime, financing terrorism and exchange fraud.

In a separate case that same week, four people operating over 300 ASIC machines were arrested by agents from the Cuerpo de Investigaciones Científicas, Penales y Criminalísticas (CICPC) in the relatively small town of Charallave. Somewhat similarly, these four suspects were charged with electricity theft and internet fraud, Spanish-language Bitcoin news site CriptoNoticias reported. According to the director of the CICPC, the miners had affected “the consumption and the stability” of electricity service in Charallave, reported reason.com.

And, perhaps the most notable case, the PNB also arrested two men from Caracas. As opposed to the other suspects, these men were not themselves mining Bitcoin. Rather, they attempted to sell mining equipment through MercadoLibre, an online marketplace. It is currently not clear what these men were arrested for exactly.

And to top it off, Venezuela’s biggest bitcoin exchange, Surbitcoin, had to halt operations as well. According to Surbitcoin, the exchange received a notice from their bank Banesco on February 2 that their bank account would be closed the next day. The exchange says it is establishing a new commercial structure to prevent situations like this one in the future, and in the meantime recommends customers use LocalBitcoins. Perhaps unsurprisingly, trading volume on LocalBitcoins broke records last week, with 1.12 billion bolivars’ (approximately $337,000) worth of bitcoin exchanged.

While it seems that Venezuelan authorities have increased the pressure these past two weeks, it is not the first time Bitcoin miners were arrested in the country. About a year ago, a Bitcoin miner was arrested and jailed for three months on charges of electricity theft. Unsurprisingly, most Venezuelan miners therefore keep their operations relatively small and hidden from authorities.",REGULATION,-0.996
2017/2/27,What the New Congressional Caucus Could Mean for Bitcoin,"In a move that raised eyebrows among tech policy advocates, Reps. Jared Polis (D-Colo.) and David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) officially launched the Congressional Blockchain Caucus in early February. First announced in September of 2016, this bipartisan working group will target the policy advancement of blockchain-oriented technologies and digital currencies.

In an official statement, Polis expressed his optimism about this next step for the caucus:

“Blockchain [technology] has the potential to transform the 21st century economy,” Polis said. “Lawmakers need to understand that as the world rapidly changes, it’s our responsibility to ensure that we craft policies and adapt laws that match our ingenuity. Blockchain [technology]’s potential to reshape everything from the financial industry, to supply chains, to cybersecurity, to healthcare is something we should embrace. I look forward to the caucus’s upcoming policy briefings and meetings that will educate members of Congress on these innovative technologies.”

Rep. Schweikert furthered those sentiments. “Open blockchain networks and distributed ledger technologies are still new, but it’s critical for members of Congress to begin comprehending both their current applications and future use cases. It is critically important the United States remain competitive regarding emerging technologies, and distributed ledger technology is the open, secure, efficient technology backbone we’ve been looking for.”

The primary aim of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus is to educate, engage and offer research to assist policymakers in pursuing thoughtful regulatory approaches to the issues facing the rapidly growing blockchain network landscape.

Polis’s cohort Schweikert replaced former Co-Chair of the Blockchain Caucus, Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R–South Carolina), who was successfully confirmed as U.S. President Donald Trump’s budget director after a tight, heated vote.

Rep. Mulvaney is widely seen as pro-Bitcoin and a major blockchain advocate. There is growing belief that his appointment will fuel the integration of blockchain technology into the U.S. government, even allowing Bitcoin to find a safe legal haven against onerous federal regulations.

An Outside-the-Beltway Perspective

Steven J. Ehrlich, associate at the New York–based Spitzberg Partners LLC, offered his insights to Bitcoin Magazine on the new caucus and the future of blockchain technology in government. Spitzberg Partners is a consultancy that assists clients in development, market entry and M&A strategies for Europe, North America and beyond.

“I applaud the launch of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus and am happy to see that the issue will continue moving forward following the ascension of former Co-Chair Mick Mulvaney, with Rep. David Schweikert taking his place,” said Ehrlich.

Ehrlich believes that having a formal mechanism to discuss the potential use cases and public policy implications of this technology is critical to achieving more mainstream diffusion of this information.

He says that it will become harder to argue that this technology is strictly a law-enforcement issue or is exclusively useful for illicit activities if there is a dedicated group in Washington centered on promoting its use.

“I think that the U.S. continues to face challenges regulating the industry and the outlook is uncertain. Moreover I believe it’s too early to make any broad assessments on what the impact of President Trump will be, but my initial outlook — although Mulvaney could temper it — is somewhat negative. Given his strong focus on security I see it as unlikely that he would give the benefit of the doubt to any technology, including virtual currencies, which has a whiff of impropriety.”

From a policy and regulatory point of view, Ehrlich believes the initial focus will likely center around security and consumer protection. Above all else, he says, it is the responsibility of the government to protect its citizens from all threats, be it a terrorist attack, criminal activity or negligence. So that is the initial threshold that any blockchain application will have to cross.

Back in September, Rep. Mulvaney said, “Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the financial services industry, the U.S. economy and the delivery of government services.”

Ehrlich agreed but with a few qualifiers:

“First, the end state being described here is a long ways out and will necessitate a series of trials and errors combined with a piecemeal approach across different industries.

“Second, it is important to remember that we are not building these technology stacks from scratch. There are legacy systems across every industry that must be integrated, updated or replaced, which creates additional complications.

“Third, we often use the terms blockchain or distributed ledger technologies as if they are monoliths, but they are not.”

Ehrlich contends that there are many different platforms and ecosystems in development and at some point either one will win out or there will have to be a way for multiple blockchains to communicate with one another. “A siloed approach will not work at scale,” he said.

According to Ehrlich, assuming that these hurdles are cleared, blockchain technology offers the potential to add transparency, speed and efficiency to virtually any industry that requires shared records or knowledge.

“From a cybersecurity point of view, being able to have absolute certainty that your systems and records are maintaining their integrity and confidentiality is invaluable. Additionally, through the use of smart contracts and the transparency of blockchains, state and federal governments can more efficiently collect taxes, disburse benefits, track spending, etc.”

Ehrlich cites what’s currently taking place in state governments as just one example, saying that it will be very interesting to follow developments in Delaware over the course of 2017, as they are already working on a live project involving smart contracts and their public archives.

He says that the state has even loftier plans, including legally enforceable smart UCC filings, and expects the takeaways from these projects to reverberate throughout Washington and around the country.

2017/3/10,New Coalition Formed to Lobby for Clarity in Digital Asset Tax Policies,"The Chamber of Digital Commerce and law firm Steptoe & Johnson LLP announced the formation of the Digital Asset Tax Policy Coalition, composed of digital currency industry stakeholders to lobby for more adequate digital currency tax policies to create clarity around the subject of taxation of digital assets.

The coalition is led by the Chamber of Digital Commerce, a trade association dedicated to promoting the understanding and acceptance of digital assets, and includes several leading U.S.-based bitcoin wallet providers, digital currency exchanges and digital currency transaction processing platforms. Steptoe & Johnson will provide legal counsel to the coalition.

Currently, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) classifies digital currency holdings as property under Notice 2014-21, which was published in April 2014, but has not provided more detailed guidance on how digital currency and digital asset holdings should be appropriately taxed.

It is in response to this lack of clear taxation policies for digital assets that the Digital Asset Tax Policy Coalition, based in Washington, D.C., has been formed.

Perianne Boring, president and founder of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, said in the press release: “Clear tax treatment for digital assets is essential to ensure robust growth of this important sector.”

Jason Weinstein, a Steptoe partner and co-chair of the law firm’s Blockchain and Digital Currency practice, believes that “tax solutions that allow the IRS to do its job without resorting to actions such as a John Doe summons will be of benefit to all.”

The John Doe summons that Weinstein is referring to was served by the IRS to the bitcoin wallet provider and digital currency exchange Coinbase Inc. in November 2016 to investigate digital currency transactions by U.S. taxpayers under the suspicion that taxpayers were hiding taxable income from the IRS.


The Digital Asset Tax Policy Coalition aims to address these types of digital currency taxation issues by proactively engaging with policymakers on issues of mutual concern. The formation of the coalition follows the creation of the Blockchain Alliance, which was also co-founded by the Chamber of Digital Commerce, to help combat criminal activity linked to digital currencies by acting as a resource to law enforcement and by providing an open forum for the private sector, law enforcement and regulators to discuss digital assets.

While early bitcoin adopters, cypherpunks and “be your own bank” idealists would prefer that the taxman stay out of their business, the reality is that if bitcoin wants to succeed both as a viable transactional currency and as an investment asset class, there needs to be clear guidance from the tax authorities on how digital currencies and digital assets need to be taxed. This will help both bitcoin adoption and the growth of the bitcoin economy in the U.S.",REGULATION,0.6486
2017/3/11,SEC Dashes Hopes of a Bitcoin ETF — For Now,"The COIN ETF is a no-go.

Almost four years in the making, in a highly anticipated verdict published earlier today, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected the the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust exchange traded fund (ETF).

An ETF is an investment fund that holds assets like stocks, commodities or bonds, and trades on stock exchanges. This ETF, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust intended to have been listed as COIN, would have let institutional investors invest in bitcoin, without actually needing to buy or hold the digital currency themselves; these would be held by a custodian, Gemini.

In its decision, the SEC singled out two major concerns regarding the application. First, the exchange must have surveillance-sharing agreements with significant markets for trading the underlying commodity or derivatives on that commodity. And second, those markets must be regulated.

“[T]he Commission does not find that the proposed rule change is consistent with […] the Exchange Act—which requires that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed, among other things, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect investors and the public interest — because the Commission believes that the significant markets for bitcoin are unregulated and that, therefore, the Exchange has not entered into, and would currently be unable to enter into, the type of surveillance-sharing agreement that helps address concerns about the potential for fraudulent or manipulative acts and practices in the market for the Shares.”

Gemini — the bitcoin exchange operated by the Winklevoss twins and proposed custodian for COIN — is properly regulated in New York state, but only accounts for relatively low trade volumes. Meanwhile the major bitcoin markets, the SEC notes, are currently located outside of US jurisdiction.

Immediately following the announcement, the price of bitcoin dropped sharply from some $1290 to $970 and is sitting around $1120 at time of publication.

Reactions

Unsurprisingly, not everyone agrees with the verdict.

“This creates a chicken-and-egg problem,” Coin Center’s Jerry Brito commented. “How do we develop well-capitalized and regulated markets in the U.S. and Europe if financial innovators aren’t allowed to bring products to market that grow domestic demand for digital currencies like Bitcoin?”

In spite of disappointment among many bitcoiners at the result, there are plenty in the community who are nonplussed by the news.  #bitcoin's value unaffected as ‘plan B’ for political attacks on cash & gold, access to funds transfers, through geopolitical uncertainty. the ETFs dont add to #bitcoin utility, they give passive investors an easier way to buy the future potential, though lacking bearer property. For some, it was even viewed as an affirmation: The ETF was denied because bitcoin can't be regulated, can't be surveilled. 

Feature, not bug. “The disapproval does not change Bitcoin’s compelling fundamental growth story,” Spencer Bogart, Managing Director and Research Head at Blockchain Capital, said to Bitcoin Magazine. “We always viewed the potential for the ETF as a low-probability event that would only accelerate and de-risk the trajectory that bitcoin has already been on over the past 8 years.” We choose to go to the Moon not because some ""authority"" approved the mission, but because they claimed we couldn't do it without them. Future Implications

Besides COIN, two other bitcoin ETFs are still in the running: SolidX Bitcoin Trust and the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT), sponsored by Barry Silbert’s Grayscale Investments. SolidX Bitcoin Trust is due to be considered for approval by the SEC by the end of this month — BIT will take until the end of the year.

However, given the motivation to reject the Winklevoss’ ETF, Bogart considers it unlikely these two will have more luck with the SEC.

“The grounds for the disapproval suggest that the other Bitcoin ETFs that are going through the approval process are also unlikely to be approved,” he said. “It was disapproved because the markets on which bitcoin primarily trades are largely unregulated and, as such, the SEC would be unable to enter into “surveillance-sharing” agreements that, among other things, help the Commission stomp out market manipulation.”

The SEC itself, meanwhile, ended the order on a more positive note — at least for the long-term prospects of a Bitcoin ETF.

“The Commission notes that bitcoin is still in the relatively early stages of its development and that, over time, regulated bitcoin-related markets of significant size may develop,” the decision states. “Should such markets develop, the Commission could consider whether a bitcoin ETP would, based on the facts and circumstances then presented, be consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act.”",REGULATION,0.4215
2017/3/17,Bitcoin Traders Report Some Bank Accounts Still Being Terminated,"Santander Bank, the $90 billion Spanish financial institution and banking group, recently began to close accounts of users involved with bitcoin trading. According to U.K.-based bitcoin trading firm Bittylicious, customers of Santander Bank received official letters of account termination almost immediately after utilizing their bank accounts to purchase or sell bitcoin.

Since mid-2015, major banks and financial service providers in countries including the U.S. and Australia have singled out customers and businesses involved with bitcoin trading or operations. In September of 2015, Rod Sim, chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, opened an investigation into the country’s largest banks, such as the Commonwealth Bank, which were suspected of abruptly terminating user accounts without sending any prior notifications.

At the time, Queensland Nationals Senator Matthew Canavan wrote:

“The actions by the banks would appear to directly engage competition in the financial services industry as it stands now — and, by effectively nipping in the bud the growth of potential competitors, is likely to substantially reduce the potential for future competition to the detriment of consumers in the future.”

The unexpected closure of bank accounts of bitcoin users and businesses led to local digital currency businesses terminating their services. Businesses refused to provide bitcoin payment and trading services within Australia due to limited methods of facilitating fiat reserves.

Similar Case in the U.S. 

A similar trend has emerged in Europe, as Santander Bank started to send official bank account termination notices to users suspected of using their accounts to trade in digital currencies such as bitcoin and ether.

The letter acquired by Bittylicious emphasized that the bank will not be able to provide any banking services to users and declined to provide explanations for their decision. Several users received identical bank account closure letters from Santander Bank business manager Victoria Wells, who wrote:

“We want to let you know that we can’t offer you banking facilities anymore. Under the terms and conditions of the account, we can withdraw banking facilities by giving you notice in writing and, in line with our company policy, we don’t give further information about how we’ve made our decision.”

Santander Bank’s account-termination message was nearly identical to that of the Australian banks’ letters in October of 2015. During that period, Bitcoin Magazine reported that the Commonwealth Bank, amongst other major Australian banks, refused to provide any additional explanation or clarification on why bitcoin business and user accounts have been terminated.

“Our members have said the banks have been remarkably unwilling to provide explanations for ceasing to provide services for ADCCA members. Our members, some of whom may end up being partners with or competitors to the banks in the future, are currently at the mercy of established financial institutions,” the Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association Chairman Ron Tucker told Bitcoin Magazine at the time.

The decision of Santander Bank to close the bank accounts of bitcoin users is more controversial now because of the clear legality of bitcoin in Europe and the U.S. Most bitcoin exchanges are well regulated and strictly compliant with both financial and money transmission regulations. Since exchanges can be suspended when operating without proper Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems, the regulatory aspect of bitcoin shouldn’t be a factor when closing the accounts of bitcoin users.

Currently, major banks including Santander Bank are focusing on the development of their own digital currencies and unique financial infrastructure, utilizing Bitcoin’s fundamental blockchain technology. It could be perceived, therefore, that Santander Bank is demonstrating a hostile behavior toward bitcoin users to protect their own interest in blockchain technology.

In fact, Santander Bank recently left the R3 consortium to focus on blockchain technology development after the consortium clarified that they will not need blockchain technology in order to provide essential infrastructure to the global financial industry. Santander is also extremely optimistic toward the future of blockchain technology, and according to the bank, the technology will cut operating costs of banks by up to $20 billion by 2022.",REGULATION,0.8402
2017/4/20,Positive Outlook From Japan and Russia Drives Bitcoin Toward New Highs,"Since the beginning of April, the price of bitcoin has stabilized above the $1,000 mark and has started to push toward its recent all-time high of $1,263. The main drivers for this rally have been positive news out of Japan and Russia.

Since April 1, the price of bitcoin rallied from $1,070 to peak at this month’s high of $1,227 on April 11. At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at around $1,218 according to BitcoinAverage. The market value of bitcoin has increased from around $17.5 billion on April 1 to surpass $19.5 billion on April 20, according to data compiled by CoinMarketCap.

Bitcoin Is Big in Japan

Japan officially recognized bitcoin as a legal payment method on April 1, which gave bitcoin an immediate price boost following the announcement. Not only can bitcoin now be legally used in Japan to make purchases and send remittances, but the digital currency is also exempt from sales tax.

Furthermore, following the legalization of bitcoin, two major retailers announced their intentions to offer bitcoin as a payment method in their stores. Retail giants Bic Camera and Recruit Lifestyle have both announced that they will trial bitcoin payments in anticipation of a possible increase in the use of bitcoin for consumer purchases. As Recruit Lifestyle uses the point-of-sale app AirREGI, which enables merchants to accept bitcoin payments, there is the potential that over a quarter of a million Japanese retailers may soon accept bitcoin payments before the end of the year.

Given that Japan has become a trading hub for bitcoin, the positive news coming out of the country not only boosted local demand but also increased bitcoin buying globally. Traders are likely to be optimistic since its new legitimate status could give the price of bitcoin a substantial boost driven by real demand in the coming months.

Russia Is Changing Its Stance Toward Bitcoin

Russia has been a tricky jurisdiction for bitcoin users and startups, as Russia’s central bank, the Bank of Russia, effectively banned the use of digital currencies in 2014 for fear it would undermine the Russian ruble, which was struggling at the time.

The bitcoin ban resulted in bitcoin websites being shut down and led to several lawmakers speaking out against the use of digital currencies in Russia, suggesting that they are a vehicle for money laundering and terrorist financing and that they “cannot be used by individuals or legal entities,” according to the Russian Prosecutor General’s Office.

However, at the end of 2016, the sentiment toward bitcoin in Russia started to change. The Russian Federal Tax Service issued a letter in October 2016 that stated that under Russian law digital currencies are not illegal and that there are no prohibitions for citizens or companies when it comes to dealing with them. While this letter was a clear change in sentiment by Russian authorities, it gave no clear indication of how digital currencies will be regulated in Russia.

Last week, however, Russia’s Deputy Finance Minister Alexey Moiseev told Bloomberg in an interview that the Russian central bank and the government are working on a joint position that could see digital currencies such as bitcoin become recognized as a legal payment method as soon as 2018. Meanwhile, his counterpart at the Russian central bank, Deputy Governor Olga Skorobogatova, stated in February that the authorities intend to decide by mid-2017 whether digital currencies should be considered as cash, an asset or a security.

Russia’s change in sentiment toward bitcoin has helped to boost the currency’s price and will likely increase its demand in the world’s 11th largest economy, which could potentially push the price of bitcoin to new highs in the months to come.",REGULATION,0.5574
2017/4/21,"Making the Case for Bitcoin as Legal Property
“Interests in bitcoin should be protected by property law,” the Perkins Coie white paper concludes.","As Bitcoin is adopted by more users every day, the need to determine how it can integrate into mainstream society becomes even more pressing. One major question continues to be how traditional laws apply to Bitcoin and its use.

Many of those determinations could have major implications for Bitcoin and its holders, and few will play a bigger role in the United States than property laws, which could ultimately govern ownership over the digital currency.

A new white paper, “Treatment of Bitcoin Under U.S. Property Law,” seeks to analyze how the worlds of digital currency and property law should intersect. The report was assembled by Perkins Coie, an international law firm that specializes in blockchain technology and digital currency and has been active in the space since 2013. While detailed and clearly well-researched, the paper’s foremost conclusion is straightforward and transparent.

“We conclude that property interests should exist in bitcoin under such law, and that multiple sources of persuasive authority provide additional support for that conclusion,” the paper’s authors, J. Dax Hansen and Joshua L. Boehm, wrote.

The paper begins with an overview of Bitcoin’s technological attributes and what those mean for how property law can apply to it. Using California state law as a benchmark and Bitcoin transactions as an example, the authors make their case.

“Parties may ... enter into contractual arrangements in which one party entrusts partial or complete control of such private key(s) to a third party while still maintaining formal title to the bitcoin value represented in applicable [unspent transaction outputs],” the paper reads. “These kinds of contractual arrangements are commonplace in custodial, trust, and escrow settings, which have generated well-developed legal principles that should generally translate to bitcoin custodial contexts.”

The paper dissects academic articles from some of the country’s foremost law professors, who also, for the most part, support the idea that intangible property rights should apply to Bitcoin:

“Property law scholars who have encountered the bitcoin ownership issues in the context of broader, more theoretical undertakings have reached (or assumed) the same general conclusion ... that is, interests in bitcoin should be protected by property law.”

The authors move on to describe how Bitcoin has been treated by other legal divisions, such as commodities and taxation laws, citing the fact that in court opinions and regulatory guidance under these specialties, the digital currency has been treated as property.

“Although the concept of ‘property’ is fundamentally a matter of state law in the United States, it is also important that bitcoin has been widely treated as (or assumed to be) property for purposes of other state and federal statutory regimes,” reads the paper. “These treatments and assumptions have already had substantial consequences for the bitcoin sector. They therefore constitute informal but persuasive legal precedent further indicating that bitcoin can be owned as property.”

In an acknowledgment that much is still to be determined around how U.S. laws govern Bitcoin, the authors also included a section looking at the challenges to treating the digital currency as legal property. These include the multisignature arrangements, pseudoanonymity and potential lack of traceability associated with the Bitcoin platform. However, the authors remain optimistic that these challenges can be overcome as the technology develops.

“To be sure, difficulties in tracing ownership of particular bitcoin units across successive owners could cause some challenges in certain commercial use cases,” they wrote, but “blockchain technology itself has enabled, and will likely continue to enable, solutions to obstacles that do arise.”

It does appear that the worlds of Bitcoin and formal legal precedent are rapidly coming to a head. As the turning point approaches, familiarity with relevant legal precedent will be crucial.",REGULATION,0.5267
2017/4/21,"Attorney Pamela Morgan Explores Initial Coin Offerings from a Legal Perspective
“The law cares about how you use these technologies...If you use it like a stock, you’re probably going to be regulated as if it’s a stock.”","During a recent talk at Blockchain Meetup Zurich, Pamela Morgan, who is the CEO of Third Key Solutions and an attorney at Empowered Law PLLC, shared some of her thoughts on Bitcoin, Ethereum and blockchain technology from a legal perspective. While she claimed to often hear that smart contracts are going to replace lawyers, Morgan said she does not believe this will happen; however, she added that lawyers definitely need to pay attention to this space.

“Smart contracts will not replace lawyers; however, smart contracts will replace lazy lawyers,” Morgan said. “The real question is: What value is being provided? ... If you’re providing value of filling in a form and you’re using the same form you’ve used for every other client, guess what? Those days are numbered. However, if you’re providing strategy, if you’re understanding the business nuances and the risks, those services are not going to be outsourced — and certainly not by smart contracts — anytime soon.”

According to Morgan, Bitcoin and related technologies will affect the practice of law in every possible area. A slide from Morgan’s presentation listed 21 types of law that will be affected by the technology, and one of the specific areas of law she explored in the context of blockchain technology was the use of crypto tokens as an alternative to traditional avenues for public investment.

What Is an Initial Coin Offering?

The first area of law explored by Morgan during her talk was initial public offerings (IPOs). An IPO is a type of public offering in which shares of a company are offered to the general public for the first time. There is a large amount of regulation and added costs involved with this process. For example, according to Forbes, underwriters received $51 million when financial data provider Markit Ltd. went public in 2014.

An initial coin offering (ICO) is a process by which a percentage of the initial supply in a new digital currency project is offered to the public. It is said that these sorts of offerings require less regulatory hassle because they’re described as software pre-sales rather than public stock offerings, but it’s unclear if this claim is true at this point in time.

The Blockchain Doesn’t Shield You From the SEC

“For those of you who practice securities law, you are terrified, and you probably should be,” Morgan said about ICOs during her recent talk. “If anyone is selling these securities to U.S. citizens, you will get in trouble with the SEC for sure. I’m sure there are other jurisdictions that don’t look kindly on this, so this is a developing area of law.”

Ethereum is perhaps the most notable project that was launched via an ICO, of sorts, and it’s unclear whether the SEC will eventually clamp down on this sort of activity. While the Ethereum Foundation contends that ether is a product, rather than a security or investment vehicle, their claim can be open to alternate interpretations.

Morgan told Bitcoin Magazine that while the ether presale looks less like a security than many of today's ICOs, that doesn’t mean that the SEC will be appeased. “Ethereum wouldn't be the first to attempt legal sophistry and semantics to avoid regulation; the SEC takes a dim view of such tactics. If in the eyes of the SEC the Ethereum presale is deemed a security, no disclaimers by the company will deter SEC action.”


ConsenSys, which is an incubator of Ethereum projects, has been involved with a number of token offerings on top of the Ethereum platform, and their chief of staff Jeremy Millar recently noted that even they have a fair amount of skepticism of the viability of most of the recently launched ICO projects.

“The law cares about how you use these technologies,” Morgan explained during her talk. “If you use it like a stock, you’re probably going to be regulated as if it’s a stock.”

Differentiating Between Scams and Legitimate Projects

There have been many scams in the Bitcoin space over the years, and offering some sort of alternative token other than bitcoin is involved with a high percentage of these fraudulent schemes.

During her talk, Morgan explained that many of the bitcoin alternatives on the market have no special value to offer. “Some of them are actually centralized,” she noted. “Some of them are actually pretty close to what I would call a Ponzi scheme. Some of them are offering guaranteed returns. It’s kind of the Wild Wild West out there; it’s kind of a mess.”

In Morgan’s view, the best way to tell the difference between a scammy kind of altcoin and one that may offer value is to look at Bitcoin’s and Ethereum’s core characteristics of decentralization, independence, openness and consensus based on proof of work. “The further you get away from these characteristics, the more you have a chance of being in that dangerous kind of scammy zone,” she added.",REGULATION,0.7184
2017/4/28,RegTech for Fintech May Be the Next “Big Thing” in the Bitcoin and Blockchain Space,"Coinfirm estimates that RegTech can reduce compliance costs for financial services companies by as much as 50 percent.

RegTech may be “the next big thing” in fintech as digital currency and blockchain startups bump up against new government regulations, resulting in an increase in the demand for legal compliance information that will help companies navigate regulatory requirements and conduct risk assessments.

Banks and other financial institutions are also looking for cost-effective ways to assess the risks of using new blockchain technologies in different jurisdictions and to modify their practices to minimize increasing compliance costs.

Accenture estimates that business compliance costs could drop by 30 to 50 percent at the product level with the use of a blockchain database.

In its recent news release, Coinfirm estimates that companies can save as much as 50 percent by using regulatory and compliance technology. As recognized experts in the regulatory compliance field, the U.K.-based startup is well placed to benefit from this growing demand.

Pawel Kuskowski, Coinfirm CEO and cofounder, noted recently that RegTech is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to take advantage of the inevitable increase in rules and regulations that accompany a new field of enterprise.

Kuskowski told Bitcoin Magazine:

“For us, challenges include segmented regulations for cryptocurrencies or blockchain transactions on local levels. Bitlicense [is] an extreme example, but locally driven regulations create segmentation for a technology, system and industry that is organically without borders.

“That’s one of the reasons we are so active with regulators and are influencing the direction of the regulatory landscape. Our goal is to create a global standard for blockchain transactions with our AML & Compliance platform being a part of that global standard.”

SEI Gets Ahead of the Curve With Codify, Its New RegTech Incubator

Recognizing the growing importance of knowing and understanding increasingly complex “rules,” SEI, a leading U.K.-based financial services and wealth management firm, has launched Codify — an incubator specifically for RegTech firms that are positioning themselves to take advantage of this demand.

Ahsan Mallick, general counsel at SEI U.K. and executive sponsor of Codify, told Bitcoin Magazine:

“We created Codify to support promising early-stage businesses that are developing tech solutions to address the world’s growing and demanding regulatory requirements.

“The importance of regulatory tech can’t be overstated as domestic and international regulation become more complex for all types of institutions,” he added.

The Codify incubator offers the three current startups office space in SEI’s headquarters in London, mentoring from both SEI employees and external experts like Jason Boud of RegTech Forum, access to SEI’s clients for potential investment and an opportunity to pitch their RegTech solutions.

The three RegTech startups currently in Codify are Coinfirm, Enforcd and Neuroprofiler.

RegTech Automates Routine Compliance, Freeing Up Analysts to Problem Solve

The automation of regulatory compliance comes from a combination of increasing compliance demands and the need to be cost effective.

Coinfirm estimates that the current compliance systems catch only around 2 percent of money laundering, if not less, and that with blockchain adoption and using a platform like Coinfirm’s, that 2 percent effectiveness could increase to over 90 percent.

Amber D. Scott, whose company Outlier Solutions works with digital currency and blockchain startups on anti-money laundering (AML) and regulatory compliance, told Bitcoin Magazine:

“The complexity of regulatory requirements has been increasing for over a decade now. In step with this, compliance costs have been continuously increasing over the same period ... but this is hurting more than just firms’ bottom lines.”

Scott noted that, for most businesses, it is becoming impossible to conduct effective transaction monitoring or to have any real sense of the data without automation. “We often hear people say that they ‘know their clients’ — this is a common refrain in every regulated business, but regulators aren’t buying it. Unless you can prove it, you’re out of luck ... Fortunately, most automated tools have excellent audit trails.”

Coinfirm is most recognized for its Blockchain AML and Compliance platform, which has been used by major banks and digital currencies like Dash. Its platform uses proprietary algorithms and big data analytics to increase efficiency, reduce costs and streamline compliance to near automation.

It is also blockchain agnostic, meaning that it is technically adoptable for any type of blockchain whether public like Bitcoin or Dash, or private such as the blockchain solutions many large companies and institutions are developing.

Coinfirm is also promoting its blockchain solution for the registration and verification of authenticity of any type of document, record or file. Their Document Verification Platform is currently bringing in traditional players to use public blockchains like Bitcoin or Dash but in a way that naturally fits their already existing needs and processes.

The challenge that RegTech encounters is obtaining accurate and timely data from a myriad of legacy systems and interpreting this data appropriately.

Scott isn’t concerned about the growth of automated RegTech:

“I’m occasionally asked if I am at all concerned about the cannibalization of these industries by automation, but I think that this is an absurd question. I hope that large swaths of the industry will be automated, freeing up humans to add real value rather than performing repetitive compliance tasks. Ultimately, automation will lead to happier compliance geeks because we will be able to focus on solving novel problems.”",REGULATION,0.9992
2017/5/8,Bitcoin Investment Trust Ups Its Proposed IPO But Approval Is Still In Question,"On January 20, 2017, Grayscale Investments LLC filed for an initial public offering (IPO) for its Bitcoin Investment Trust to be listed on the NYSE Accra exchange in an attempt to bring bitcoin investing to the masses through a publicly tradable investment vehicle in the form of a new stock.

Grayscale Investments, the investment management subsidiary of the Barry Silbert-led Digital Currency Group, established the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) in 2013, hoping to provide investors with the opportunity to invest in the digital currency bitcoin without having to purchase and securely store the digital currency themselves.

The Bitcoin Investment Trust, which carries the ticker GBTC, tracks the TradeBlock XBX Index 24-hour VWAP bitcoin index and charges a 2 percent annual management fee. The Trust currently has around $262 million assets under management. Shares in the Bitcoin Investment Trust can be traded over-the-counter and can be held in traditional investment accounts, such as IRAs and Roth IRAs.

By going public, Grayscale Investments wants to open up its bitcoin investment vehicle to a broader investor base that prefers the comfort of investing in an exchange-traded and fully regulated security.

On May 4, 2017, Grayscale Investments LLC submitted an amendment to its IPO filing with the SEC increasing the size of its proposed IPO from $500 million to $1 billion dollars suggesting that the interest in a publicly-tradeable and regulated investment vehicle that tracks the price of bitcoin would see substantial interest from institutional and private investors.

However, given the SEC recent decisions not to approve the long-awaited Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF (COIN) as well as the SolidX Bitcoin Trust, the chances for the Bitcoin Investment Trust’s IPO to gain regulatory approval are not high.

While Alan Friedland, founder and CEO of Compcoin, doesn’t hold much hope for the ETF approval just yet, he agrees that there is enough demand from established institution investors for bitcoin as an alternative asset class to merit the $1 billion IPO increase.

“Digital coins will be the fastest growing financial market and we are projecting a 1.7 trillion dollar market cap by 2025,” he told Bitcoin Magazine.

When the SEC announced in March that it would not approve the two proposed bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the regulator stated that a bitcoin ETF would require ""surveillance-sharing agreements with significant markets for trading the underlying commodity or derivatives on that commodity. And second, those markets must be regulated.""

Since these conditions are still not met for bitcoin, an approval of the Bitcoin Investment Trust looks rather unlikely.  

Spencer Bogart, analyst at Blockchain Capital, thinks that it is “highly unlikely” that this renewed ETF consideration will be approved. “The SEC disapproved the prior two ETFs not because they took issue with the structure of the fund but because the SEC currently considers the major markets on which bitcoin is traded to be too unregulated,” Bogart told Bitcoin Magazine. “Given that this hasn’t changed since the last disapproval, the SEC is unlikely to offer a different response.”

Bogart is more optimistic about the chances of an ETF approval outside of the United States. “I think mainstream investment products will first be approved by foreign regulatory agencies (to some extent this has already happened). In regards to the approval of a U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETF, I think it’s more likely that the SEC changes its view (e.g. with regime change) than it is that the Bitcoin ecosystem changes such that the majority of activity flows to highly regulated markets.”",REGULATION,0.7506
2017/5/10,"In China, Bitcoin Faces Tonal Bias as Blockchain Tech Flourishes
Penalties imposed on major exchanges underscore perceptions that bitcoin requires heavy regulation and oversight.","Across China, blockchain technology is recognized as an increasingly important development; however, bitcoin as a “virtual good” in China is facing yet another challenge from the People’s Bank of China (PBOC).

On May 10, 2017, China’s top-tier financial media outlet, Caixin, reported that “according to a person close to PBOC, PBOC will soon issue a notice of penalties to BTCC, OKCoin and Huobi for irregularities based on its previous inspection in the past few months. The major problems are [related to] illegal margin trading services and lack of internal controls for anti-money laundering. The related penalty details have already been confirmed internally; all that is left to do is go through approval procedures.”

Caixin also stated that, according to their source, further “regulation on bitcoin exchange and regulation on anti-money laundering systems for bitcoin exchange will likely be released in June.”

“A person close to PBOC” is a common citation used by Caixin. Considered to be the most influential media in China’s economic and political sphere, Caixin is usually the first outlet in China to disclose any news from the PBOC related to Bitcoin, and always has insider access. It is, in effect, a mouthpiece by which the PBOC communicates with bitcoin exchanges and the Bitcoin community as a whole.

It is worth noting, however, that Caixin often tends to exaggerate the PBOC’s actual political influence. For example, when the PBOC inspected the three biggest exchanges, Caixin said the PBOC would “thoroughly inspect and regulate” them. However, the official statement released by the PBOC merely suggested that the PBOC, together with the local financial office, would “inspect exchanges.” Similarly, Caixin said, “With staunch resolution and with bottom-level efforts, the local Financial Office and PBOC [would] jointly resolve the bitcoin exchange issue.”

The result of this consistent tonal bias from China’s most influential media, as it represents the interests of the PBOC, is to portray Bitcoin’s public image in China as still something deeply connected with price volatility and money laundering, and in need of severe government regulation. As to Bitcoin’s features like decentralization and P2P transactions, Caixin remains pointedly silent.

Conversely, the incoming penalties and regulations should be interpreted as a signal that the big three exchanges will soon be allowed to resume bitcoin withdrawal, though at a cost. Still this negative portrayal of bitcoin trading shows that, at least in the short run, bitcoin in China will have difficulty gaining legal tender status as a payment tool, as opposed to the acceptance that it is seeing in Japan.

The logic behind this stance seems natural considering that the PBOC’s own version of digital currency is already around the corner; Caixin announced in January that it had successfully completed a demo.

In China, blockchain technology itself is enjoying its spring. People’s Daily, the Chinese state-run media, speaks highly of it. China’s 13th Five-Year Plan national strategy includes it. Local governments support it.

Bitcoin, however, is facing a trial. The most likely result will be that bitcoin itself will remain the same as virtual goods. As for bitcoin trading, all the stringent Know Your Customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering regulations point to one strategic bottom line: speculation of bitcoin must not result in any social or financial instability in China.",REGULATION,-0.1779
2017/5/13,More Mainstream Use Cases Needed to Secure Bitcoin's Legitimacy,"To counter negative perceptions of Bitcoin, one possible way to improve its regulatory outlook is to create more mainstream use cases for the technology.         
Blockchain technologies like the one that underpins Bitcoin are gaining wide acceptance across industry sectors from finance to healthcare to real estate. Bitcoin itself, however, is still struggling with legitimacy and regulation issues. Just this week, the fact that bitcoin was chosen as the payment method for the latest round of global data ransomware attacks, WanaCrypt0r 2.0 malware, has underscored the negative perception that still swirls around the cryptocurrency.

On the most recent episode of Epicenter, co-hosts Brian Fabian Crain and Meher Roy interviewed  Peter Van Valkenburgh, Director of Research of Coin Center, a nonprofit research and advocacy center focused on the public policy issues facing decentralized financial networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum. During the interview, Van Valkenburgh explained how Bitcoin is currently dealing with its branding issue; how Coin Center is laying the groundwork for future discussions about Bitcoin regulation; and how more mainstream uses of the technology would be helpful for discussions around regulation.

Bitcoin’s Branding Issue

Van Valkenburgh noted how Coin Center has struggled with the issues around Bitcoin as a brand, as many in the mainstream associate the digital currency with the collapse of Mt. Gox and drug sales on darknet markets.

“We take a lot of meetings with congressional staff, we take meetings with regulators at [the United States] Treasury, and oftentimes we can’t take credit for those meetings because a congressman doesn’t want it, necessarily, to immediately hit the news that he’s meeting with the Bitcoin people,” said Van Valkenburgh.

From Van Valkenburgh’s viewpoint, networks like Bitcoin are used to “decentralize power” and push security to end users’ devices. “That means you lose the choke point for regulation because the choke point for regulation is the bank, the choke point for regulation is the centralized intermediary,” he explained.

Van Valkenburgh went on to note that, since control over these networks is pushed to the edges, the technology can potentially be used for illicit activities.

Laying the Groundwork for a Future Debate

One of the illicit activities that regulators and journalists sometimes associate with Bitcoin is terrorism. Although there haven’t been any major terrorist attacks funded through Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency up to this point, that we know of, Van Valkenburgh pointed out that it’s “possible that one day somebody will use these networks in a meaningful way” to finance that sort of activity.

According to Van Valkenburgh, one of Coin Center’s main goals is to prepare for the potential conversation that would take place within government in the aftermath of such an event.

“What will be the government response when this tool is used in a way that a lot of people get upset about?” asked Van Valkenburgh. “Our metric of success, I think truly, would be a reasonable response to clear evidence of illicit uses of the technology — like dangerous, illicit uses of the technology.”

For Van Valkenburgh, success for Coin Center in such a scenario would mean the prevention of a push for an instant ban of Bitcoin and other related technologies, along with software developers not getting arrested as part of the process. Coin Center is effectively laying the groundwork to make sure these future conversations remain reasonable.

“This is a technology and, just like all technologies, it can be used for good and for evil,” said Van Valkenburgh. “We are not, as Americans, in the business of banning technologies. We’re not in the business of banning speech.”

More “Legitimate” Use Cases Needed

Going back to the aforementioned branding issue, one possible way to improve the outlook on Bitcoin from a regulatory perspective is to create more mainstream use cases for the technology. This point was originally brought up by Crain.

“If you have stuff where there is 50 million users and they are like, ‘This thing is great. It really makes something possible that I couldn’t do before. It’s a totally legitimate thing, and this is amazing.’ It would be so much harder if it’s still this kind of fringe thing,” said Crain.

Van Valkenburgh agreed with Crain’s assessment and continued, “You need the legitimate use cases to emerge. You need to show that you’re making a positive impact on the world — that it’s not just a bunch of people getting rich off of token sales or people using underground drug markets.”

Van Valkenburgh added that Coin Center hopes to clear the way, at least from a regulatory perspective, for these sort of mainstream applications to appear. “The longer we go without more mainstream, legitimate uses, the more danger we’re in,” he added.

As far as mainstream uses of Bitcoin today, Van Valkenburgh pointed to the financial autonomy enabled by the technology, and he identified WikiLeaks’s use of Bitcoin to get around a financial blockade back in 2011 as a specific example. However, Van Valkenburgh also added that this example has become more politically charged since allegations of WikiLeaks working directly with Russia have appeared.",REGULATION,0.34
2017/5/15,How Five States Are Approaching Bitcoin Regulation,"Cryptocurrency should be regulated. Cryptocurrency should not be regulated. Cryptocurrency can’t be regulated. These are all common refrains emanating from the media these days. Now lawmakers across the United States and around the world are at a crossroads as to what is next in terms of this regulatory space.

Bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrency present a monumental challenge for legislators, requiring a broad understanding of blockchain technology, especially in terms of its impact on tech innovation. Amid assertions that the U.S. is falling behind in terms of Bitcoin regulation, it could be argued that the regulatory picture is becoming clearer in 2017.

Bitcoin Magazine asked Pawel Kuskowski, CEO and co-founder of Coinfirm, and Joe Ciccolo,  president of the Illinois-based Bitcoin compliance firm BitAML, to offer some commentary about the regulatory activity taking place in five U.S. states — Washington, Illinois, Hawaii, California and Florida — and what the regulatory landscape may look like in the days ahead.

Washington

Legislators in Washington state are building momentum around new rules for businesses offering digital currency services. Senate Bill 5013 provides a definition of virtual currency along with disclosure requirements of certain information to consumers. It also would require online currency exchanges within that state to maintain a surety bond. Finally, it offers definitional and clarifying changes for how money transmitters and currency exchangers are regulated under the Uniform Money Services Act.

At the time of this writing, this bill, which was introduced in January, had passed both chambers of the state’s legislature, clearing it to be sent to Governor Jay Inslee for signature. While there is no clear indication as to Governor Inslee’s intentions, broad support of the bill seems to suggest that it may pass.

There has already been a bit of fallout, however, as some cryptocurrency-centric startups are now thinking twice about operating in the state, with several firms having pulled out in the past year, noting the increasingly challenging regulatory environment. These include digital currency exchanges Bitfinex, Bitstamp and Poloniex, the latter of which has exited Washington.

“The State of Washington also appears to have applied a relatively heavy cybersecurity component, including broad and sweeping audits of data and other systems,” says Ciccolo. “Cybersecurity is a hot-button issue that continues to remain in the headlines. Bitcoin companies are wary of a regulatory interpretation of cybersecurity fitness, especially given the nascent stage of Bitcoin and the ongoing knowledge gap as it pertains to the crypto space. For some national players, it seemed the obvious and safe choice was to simply exit the state altogether.”

Illinois  

In November of 2016, Secretary Bryan A. Schneider of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR) announced a new initiative with implications for cryptocurrencies in that state. This “Digital Currency Regulatory Guidance” is Illinois’s attempt to provide regulatory clarity on digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and Zcash. The proposed guidance provides IDFPR’s interpretation of Illinois’s Transmitters of Money Act (TOMA) related to various activities tied to digital currencies.

Says Ciccolo: “The IDFPR and Secretary Schneider continue to deliver on the state’s promise of encouraging and supporting innovation in FinTech, Bitcoin and blockchain [technology]. What we’re doing in Illinois is quite possibly unprecedented in the area of financial regulation. Our state regulators are listening and thoughtfully engaging with industry while considering the impact of any laws and regulations. I’m very optimistic about the continued growth of financial innovation in the Land of Lincoln, and Chicago as a center for the new era of financial services.”

Hawaii

In a highly publicized move, prominent Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange Coinbase announced that it was forced to cease supporting customers in the State of Hawaii due to what it called “impractical” and “untenable” regulatory policies surrounding Bitcoin in that state. In September of 2016, Coinbase was first notified of a policy that demanded that they and any other other cryptocurrency operators hold case reserves equivalent to the values being held for customers.

This development came as Hawaii was exploring a bill that would establish a working group for examining the potential role of digital currencies and blockchain technology in advancing tourism in that state. According to the bill’s text contained in House Bill 1481: “Digital currencies such as bitcoin have broad benefits for Hawaii. A large portion of Hawaii’s tourism market comes from Asia where the use of bitcoin as a virtual currency is expanding.”

Leaders at Coinbase said they were “heartened” that the bill had been introduced and that they would look forward to working with regulators. In the meantime, Ciccolo remarked: “Given its commitment to compliance and strong resources, the exit of Coinbase suggests few if any stand a chance in the Aloha State. Indeed, the case reserve requirement is overly burdensome and quite frankly utterly impractical. Since Coinbase holds a BitLicense, could it be said that Hawaii is more inhospitable to Bitcoin than New York? Let’s hope not.”

California

California’s Assembly Bill 1123, a version of New York’s infamous BitLicense, has been proposed. It reads:

“This bill would enact the Virtual Currency Act. The bill would prohibit a person from engaging in any virtual currency business, as defined, in this state unless the person is licensed by the Commissioner of Business Oversight or is exempt from the licensure requirement, as provided.”

Says Kuskowski, CEO and co-founder of Coinfirm:

“In relation to this particular proposed bill in California, any bill with strong similarities to New York’s BitLicense is obviously not the direction to go in, as we saw the effects of that particular regulation result in New York’s loss of prominence as a crypto hub. But with California’s unique position as the technology innovation and startup capital of the world, this would have an even more catastrophic effect than the N.Y. version.”

Kuskowski goes on to say that the costly fees and bureaucratic administration associated with this legislation would likely hinder innovators and startups from applying or even operating in the state. Moreover, he says it would provide another segmented regulatory structure that limits the national and global growth of companies operating in the space.

If there is any place in the world where this could have the largest negative effect it would be California.
Florida

Florida House Bill 1379 recently passed, clarifying what virtual currency is and prohibiting its use in laundering criminal proceeds. The term “virtual currency” was added to the definition of “monetary instruments” under Florida’s Money Laundering Act. The legislation is currently with Florida’s governor and is expected to be signed soon. Ever since a Miami judge dismissed a criminal case involving Bitcoin, policymakers have been intent on establishing guidelines to curb cryptocurrency use.

Says Kuskowski: “In relation to what’s been going on in Florida, a lot of regulators, especially local ones, tend to be more in the crowd profiled earlier that catches headlines, and they go a bit far. But there needs to be a balanced approach from the other side as well. People need to realize that a clear regulatory environment allows companies and creators in the space to make concrete strategic decisions that they [otherwise] can’t when the regulatory environment isn’t clear; it just has to be done properly. Once there is a clear regulation in place, businesses have the confidence to make certain strategic decisions and further grow.”",REGULATION,0.9957
2017/5/15,Palestine May Launch Its Own Cryptocurrency as Sovereign Legal Tender,"Palestinian officials are planning for the region of Palestine to receive its own digital currency within the next five years. The motivation for this stems from concerns about potential Israeli interference, Azzam Shawwa, Governor of the Palestinian Monetary Authority (PMA), told the news agency Reuters.

Palestinians have no sovereign currency of their own and use a combination of different currencies, including the euro, the dollar, the Jordanian dinar and the Israeli shekel, to conduct their daily financial transactions.

Due to the lack of a sovereign currency, Palestinian officials have little control over money supply and inflation. This is why the Palestinian Monetary Authority wants to introduce a bitcoin-like digital currency as the territory's new legal tender, which will be called “the Palestinian Pound,” according to Shawwa.

It is the Palestinian Monetary Authority's goal to become a fully-fledged and internationally recognized central bank for an independent Palestine. However, it is still unclear how a digital sovereign currency for Palestinians would sit with the 1994 Paris Protocol agreement. The protocol agreement gives the Palestinian Monetary Authority the functions of a central bank; however, it has not granted the institutions the right to issue its own currency. The Paris protocol recommends the use of the shekel in the region and, thereby, effectively provides Israel with a veto over the establishment of a Palestinian currency.

A sovereign digital currency, though, would make sense for Palestine. Not only would it allow the PMA to have more control over the country’s money supply and inflation, but it would also circumvent the practical challenges of delivering hard currency into the country as the PMA has no money-printing facilities.

""If we print currency, to get it into the country you would always need clearance from the Israelis and that could be an obstacle. So that is why we don't want to go into it,"" Shawwa explained to Reuters.  

While the digital Palestinian pound is planned to be issued within the next five years, this will be no easy task for Palestinian authorities, given that the Palestinian Monetary Authority has been trying for over a decade to become an internationally recognized central bank.

Another option for the Palestinian monetary situation would be to keep the current status quo of the four above-mentioned currencies in use or to officially recognize one of the these currencies as the territory’s legal tender. However, a digital sovereign currency would be the preferred choice for Palestine, according to Shawwa.",REGULATION,0.128
2017/5/19,University Student Involvement Supports Australia’s Booming Blockchain Community,"The blockchain industry is booming in Australia recently after the Australian Tax Office (ATO) announced changes to tax laws in the 2017–2018 budget summary by the Australian government, surrounding how digital currencies are treated in the country. In the few weeks since the announcement, active blockchain communities and events such as RegHack DownUnder have launched across the country, supported by universities and government regulators.

Australia has traditionally held strict tax laws when it comes to how they handle bitcoin and other digital currencies, defining bitcoin as a separate asset class to fiat currency and requiring that transactions involving digital currencies are taxed twice by the Australian Tax Office. The new budget summary removes any general sales tax made more than once in the supply chain using digital currency, in an attempt to “make it easier for new innovative digital currency businesses to operate in Australia” and to grow their nascent community into a global innovation hub.

The summary states, “The Government is committed to establishing Australia as a leading global financial technology (FinTech) hub and is announcing a new package that aims to position our local fintech industry as a world leader.”

This new regulatory environment has spurred growth in the community, from university campuses all the way up to the government regulators. Students have begun to launch clubs at universities across the country, and regulators and business executives have begun to take notice.

“We’re excited blockchain [technology] can finally move to our campus and Australia in a big way. There’s been a significant increase in interest from the community in the past few weeks,“ said Ryan Pousson, the regional head of the Blockchain Education Network (BEN) in Brisbane and the founder of the UQ Blockchain Club, in a statement to Bitcoin Magazine. This perspective was echoed by Jared Piper, a region head of the Blockchain Education Network in Melbourne.

Aaron Schwartz, the director of global engagement at BEN and partner at MLG Capital, told Bitcoin Magazine, “It’s super exciting to be part of a decentralized organization like BEN that is doing something unique with a swarm-style model. We are quickly spreading to countries all across the world with new chapters opening up across Australia, Colombia, Nigeria and Bangalore, just to name a few. We encourage anyone in a blockchain community around the world to reach out to get started growing their local community.”

On the weekend of May 12–14, government representatives in the energy sector and banking executives in the financial services industry came together to judge RegHack DownUnder. The brightest developers, UI/UX designers and entrepreneurs across Australia were encouraged to spend the weekend in Melbourne to develop blockchain technology solutions to solve some of the problems it faces in these two heavily regulated sectors.

In advance of the hackathon, Adam Lemmon, a blockchain expert from Toronto, flew down to Melbourne to present an overview of Ethereum development and Solidity to the community. Following the event, Lemmon said, “RegHack was an amazing experience and it was inspiring to see such a young blockchain community so excited about the technology.”

Chami Akmeemana, the organizer of RegHack DownUnder, predicts a fast growth in the community. He said to Bitcoin Magazine following the event: “It was a mammoth success. Close to 100 participants spent three days exploring tech solutions to regulatory issues. We now have 100+ blockchain enthusiasts, that I expect [will grow] to over 1000+ by the end of the year. I’m hoping to see some world-class blockchain applications coming out of Australia and I’m stoked to be part of this boost to the ecosystem.”

The regulators in Australia are on board too with this digital transformation. Igor Simunovic, a representative from the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), said in a statement following the event that “the event provided opportunity for industry (including government) and freelancers/students/developers to meet, integrate and share through the problem solving required to address the Hackathon ‘problems.’ Such meeting and teamwork opportunities are rare and often bound by the [confines] of conferences or meet-ups. The process of discovering new technologies and frameworks was just a bonus.”

It is still the beginning in the growth trajectory of the blockchain community in Australia, but it is an exciting time to be part of a global movement. For example, in the few months following November’s RegHack TO, the first hackathon hosted by a securities regulator in Canada and inspired by Chami Akmeemana, the number of people attending meetups in Toronto has tripled from 200 to over 700 at the most recent blockchain meetup in Toronto. Getting the entire community on board from universities to business executives to government regulators is an important milestone for any community striving to become a blockchain hub.",REGULATION,0.3612
2017/6/10,"Coin Center to Congress: Give Blockchain Developers ""Safe Harbor""","Coin Center was invited to present testimony on Thursday to both the House Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection and the House Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance. They explained to both subcommittees the role that digital assets play in the world, what the future of the sector may look like, and how regulators could interact with the sector in a way that protects both the consumers and the innovators and encourages businesses in the industry to reside in America.

Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center, spoke to the House Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection. He explained to the subcommittee the revolutionary role blockchain technology is playing in the world around us. “Just as the PC democratized computing, and the web democratized news and entertainment, open blockchain networks are democratizing financial services.”

Van Valkenburgh, however, drew a stark contrast between the regulatory safe harbors given to early internet innovators, specifically the Communications Decency Act and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and what little is being done to protect blockchain technology innovators today.

“Both laws created safe harbors for infrastructure-building businesses,” noted Van Valkenburgh. The laws protected the creators of the internet’s infrastructure from third-party liability stemming from the users of that infrastructure.

In a conversation with Bitcoin Magazine, Van Valkenburgh gave the example of Google. Google isn’t liable for a user who illegally downloads pirated material from a website whose link popped up on their search engine. This is because of the aforementioned Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which provided a safe harbor and allowed Google to continue to build the infrastructure of the internet (in this case, a search engine) free from crushing copyright liabilities.

A similar distinction should be drawn when it comes to regulating innovators in blockchain technology, Van Valkenburgh noted in the conversation. There are two main entities innovating in the space: custodians who hold the valuable digital assets for consumers, and developers who are building the infrastructure of blockchain technology, but who don’t hold consumer funds. “These very different entities,” said Van Valkenburgh, “should be regulated in very different ways.”

An example of a “custodian” would be Coinbase, who regularly holds a consumer’s bitcoin, ether or other digital assets. An infrastructure developer would be more like a software wallet developer, who simply creates a tool with which a consumer can interact with the blockchain, safekeep their own digital assets and send transactions. The wallet developers themselves don’t exercise any control over their users’ digital assets.

The infrastructure developers, Van Valkenburgh points out, should not then be regulated as money transmitters who must get licensed state by state before starting their business. Their role is just to create portals and pipelines through which the transactions can flow, not to direct or control the transactions themselves. If the developer were found to be misleading the consumer with his/her software product, then ex-post-regulatory punishment may be appropriate, but again, there should not have to be a permission process that precedes these developers’ endeavors.

When it comes to the custodial financial services, much of the regulation, and therefore protection for innovators, is at the state level. This makes it complicated for innovators to be based in the U.S. because of the plethora of different regulators in the space. Each regulator has the ability to affect how an innovator in blockchain technology operates.

Van Valkenburgh said in his statement to the subcommittee, “In order to reestablish the U.S. as a leader we need to rationalize the chaos of financial services regulation, starting with state-by-state money transmission licensing.”

These custodial services, the ones holding a consumer’s value, should be regulated, argues Van Valkenburgh, but they should not have to repeat a licensing process 50 or more times over. Because of that costly barrier to entry, someone innovating in the space today would be best-advised to leave the U.S. and start their business in a country with simpler regulatory structures. We must regulate at the federal level if we want a simpler licensing process.

Bitcoin and Terrorist Financing
On the same day, Jerry Brito, executive director of Coin Center, joined a panel to discuss with the United States House of Representatives Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance any national security implications of these financial innovations.

Brito explained to the subcommittee, “[Bitcoin] is open to bad actors who take advantage of it. Criminals certainly use it today, and we have begun to see some nascent interest from terrorist groups. According to a recent report on the potential of terrorist use of digital currencies by the Center for a New American Security, however, ‘Currently there is no more than anecdotal evidence that terrorist groups have used virtual currencies to support themselves.’”

Brito views the infancy of interest by these bad groups as an opportunity to get in front of the problem. “This means there is time to develop an appropriate response to the possibility; a reasoned response that targets the threat while preserving the freedom to innovate.”

The main take-home message from this meeting, however, was that, as Van Valkenburgh explained in his conversation with Bitcoin Magazine, there doesn’t actually appear to be much use of digital currency in the funding of terrorism. In fact, it is a bit unwieldy for terrorists to use because of the public nature of the distributed ledger. However, this shouldn’t stop the U.S. from developing solutions to curb the use of digital currencies by terrorists.

What Coin Center wanted these subcommittees to understand, at the end of the day, is that digital currency is here to stay. It cannot be destroyed. The technology is neither bad nor good, but instead is a new tool at the disposal of anyone with a computer. To ignore the technology is to allow other countries to take the lead in adopting and incorporating it, and gaining the benefits of it in the process.

Beginning the process of effectively and sensibly regulating digital currency is a must if the government wants to derive any benefits from its existence and prevalence.",REGULATION,-0.9799
2017/6/13,Nevada Takes a Chance on Pro-Blockchain Legislation,"Known as the Silver State, Nevada has a long established reputation for relaxed laws pertaining legalized gambling, corporate asset protection and business privacy. Now, in a move certain to be closely watched by other U.S. states, Nevada Senate Bill 398 was recently signed by the Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval, and officially passed into law under the state’s Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.

The bill was introduced and sponsored by Republican Senator Ben Kieckhefer. After being amended twice, the legislation passed by a vote of 41 to 0.

This landmark bill provides guidelines related to the use of blockchain technology. Nevada thus becomes the the first U.S. state to approve legislation blocking local government entities from taxing, licensing and imposing other requirements on blockchain use.  

According to the Senate Committee on Judiciary record document, Kieckhefer states, “Local governments cannot impose taxes, fees or other requirements relating to the use of blockchain or smart contracts.” He goes on to note that the bill will help Nevada keep pace with technological advancements, providing “a legal framework for people using a blockchain to not do so in a legal gray area.”

Said Kieckhefer: “Senate Bill 398 is an offshoot of several efforts I worked on in the 2015-2016 Interim to ensure Nevada has an environment welcoming and inclusive of startups. Entrepreneurs have been working on a package of legislation to ensure that, instead of just incentivizing large companies to relocate to the State, we have policies incentivizing them and smaller companies to start and grow here.”

The bill clarified the definition of blockchain technology, espousing it as “an electronic record created by the use of a decentralized method by multiple parties to verify and store a digital record of transactions which is secured by the use of a cryptographic hash of previous transaction information.”

Smart contracts are also defined as an electronic record, verified by the use of a blockchain: “A smart contract, record or signature may not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because a blockchain was used to create, store or verify the smart contract, record or signature.”

Most notably, electronic signatures recorded on the blockchain are now protected: “If a law requires a signature, submission of a blockchain which electronically contains the signature or verifies the intent of a person to provide the signature satisfies the law,” per the bill’s decree.

Two other U.S. states have taken similar steps to recognize blockchains as an appropriate data store, with seven in total codifying legislation pertaining to blockchains.

A number of other U.S. states have recognized, or are in the process of recognizing, blockchains as an appropriate data store. The most similar bill is from the neighboring state of Arizona, which passed House Bill 2417 into law toward the end of March. Unlike Nevada’s, however, this bill falls short of providing restrictions on taxes and licensing.

A number of  Nevada-based business leaders offered strong support and testimony for the bill, including Allison Clift-Jennings, founder of Filament, a Reno-based firm that is fostering the application of IoT and blockchain technology for industrial use.

""Having Nevada pass this legislation puts the state at an advantage, in that it clearly and succinctly outlines not so much what the state will do, but what the state will not do, when it comes to blockchain regulation,” Clift-Jennings said to Bitcoin Magazine.

“With a technology as powerful and new as this, it’s important for both established companies and startups alike to know how their jurisdiction will treat this new technology.  We’re very happy with how it turned out, and appreciate Senator Kieckhefer and Clift & Co. for their efforts in getting this passed unanimously in both the Assembly and the Senate.""

Jaron Lukasiewicz, vice-president of the Las Vegas-based construction consultancy Rhodes Corporation and an advisor to SONM (the decentralized supercomputing network) told Bitcoin Magazine that it’s “fantastic” to see Nevada taking the initiative in providing a welcoming environment for blockchain businesses in the state. “Nevada’s actions will help attract entrepreneurs in this growing industry to the state, hopefully promoting a high concentration of blockchain talent here.”

Lukasiewicz believes it has been easy for governments to develop a negative bias toward bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for a variety of reasons. He says that blockchain technology, however, seems to be moving in a different direction. “Most regulators on every level of government appear to understand the importance of blockchain technology and are working to create an environment that attract startups in the space.”",REGULATION,0.25
2017/6/19,Project TITANIUM: The EU’s Plan to Decloak Cryptocurrency,"Project TITANIUM: The EU’s Plan to Decloak Cryptocurrency

Monitor blockchains, deanonymize wallet addresses, surveil dark net markets, and stop terrorists and money launderers: that’s the main thrust of the European Union’s Project TITANIUM.

TITANIUM, which stands for Tools for the Investigation of Transactions in Underground Markets, is a three-year, €5 million ($5.5 million) project that will unite universities, private research firms and law enforcement agencies from the U.K., Germany, Spain, Austria, the Netherlands and Finland.

Project TITANIUM will develop tools and best practices for criminal investigations involving cryptocurrency in Europe, which, up to now, most law enforcement agencies have pursued on an ad-hoc basis.

The project plans to create forensic tools to spot clusters of addresses controlled by the same entity; identify mixers or tumbler addresses used for money laundering; crawl the webs, both clear and dark; and automate information gathering about illegal activities.

The project’s coordinator, Dr. Ross King of the Austrian Institute of Technology, said that criminal and terrorist uses of cryptocurrencies and dark net markets “evolve quickly.” King also insisted that Project TITANIUM would respect “citizen privacy.”

Project TITANIUM’s announcement comes just a few weeks after the ransomware worm WannaCry disabled hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150 countries. As of June 15, 2017, the hardcoded wallet addresses used by the attackers have collected about 50 BTC in ransom payments.

The project’s scope covers terrorism, as well as crime, and back-to-back attacks in Manchester and London have ignited calls for more sweeping government action to combat extremism.

On June 4, 2017, Prime Minister Theresa May called for “international agreements to regulate cyberspace” and to deny violent extremists “safe spaces” online. With terrorism in the background, cooperation on internal security matters like Project TITANIUM is likely to continue even after the U.K. formally exits the EU.

The call for more surveillance comes despite the fact that the United Kingdom already has one of the most wide-ranging surveillance laws, the Investigatory Powers Act, which went into force December 30, 2016.

Nicknamed the Snooper’s Charter, the act requires ISPs keep record of all websites users visit for one year and allows police and other public agencies to check anyone’s history without a warrant.

Meanwhile, the EU is mulling a more direct approach to the problem of cryptocurrency. According to a proposed directive released on March 9, 2017, the EU could require exchanges and wallet providers to submit account owners’ identities to a central database.

The directive goes on that “virtual currencies should not be anonymous,” and that the anonymity or pseudo-anonymity of cryptocurrencies is “more a hindrance than an asset” for legitimate users.

The rules would not just apply to bitcoin, but all “virtual currencies,” and would effectively ban anonymous cryptocurrency, at least in the EU. The proposed directive is intended to combat money laundering and terrorism, despite scant evidence that cryptocurrencies play a prominent role in either.

Nevertheless, with or without evidence that they are empowering terrorists, the anonymous or pseudo-anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies is threatening to European lawmakers, and whether through legislation or projects like TITANIUM, they intend to decloak cryptocurrency.",REGULATION,-0.9854
2017/6/22,U.S. Bill Requiring Travelers to Declare Digital Currencies Resurfaces,"The United States Senate has introduced a bill that would require all travelers entering the U.S. to declare digital currency holdings in excess of $10,000. Despite concerns raised by the invasive nature of the bill, the likelihood of it being passed is extremely low simply due to the incredibly challenging infrastructure that would be required.

In fact, the new bill is actually a reintroduction of an older bill that was originally introduced in 2011. The 2011 bill never made it out of sub-committee deliberation.

Speaking about the recent legislation development, David Siegel, founder of Twenty Thirty AG and Bitcoin enthusiast, tells Bitcoin Magazine, “It’s disappointing. It’s a step back toward 1934.”

The bill would require the Secretary of Homeland Secretary and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner to submit a joint report to Congress withinthat meets the following two conditions over 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act:

“(1) detailing a strategy to interdict and detect prepaid access devices, digital currencies, or other similar instruments, at border crossings and other ports of entry for the United States; and;
(2) that includes an assessment of infrastructure needed to carry out the strategy ...”
The amount of technology that would have to be developed in order to enforce this law is incredible. How could they detect these crypto assets? The infrastructure investment that would be needed would be quite prodigious.

“My position on regulation is that there should be strong evidence supporting its effectiveness,” says Siegel. “I don’t see declaring moving money as a transparency issue, so I would say it’s a strong step in the wrong direction. I think regulation should be scaled way back to the point where we can show it’s actually better than no regulation.”

The bill, S.1241, would add “prepaid access devices” under the definition of U.S. monetary instruments in section 5312, title 31, of the U.S. Code. Specifically, a “‘prepaid access device’ means an electronic device or vehicle, such as a card, plate, code, number, electronic serial number, mobile identification number, personal identification number, or other instrument, that provides a portal to funds or the value of funds that have been paid in advance and can be retrievable and transferable at some point in the future.”

These prepaid access devices, in theory, could extend to include electronic ledgers, cryptocurrency wallets and even private keys. These are all portals where individuals can gain access to their private funds. Thus, individuals with more than $10,000 worth of crypto assets tied up on the blockchain would have to declare their crypto net worth to the U.S. Government by filling out a Report of International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments, often called the FinCEN105. This could have a serious impact on digital currency holders traveling to the United States. Punishment for not reporting could include up to five years of jail time and forfeiture of those funds in the form of criminal and civilian penalties.

Formally known as the “Combating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Counterfeiting Act of 2017,” the bill was introduced on May 25, 2017, by Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and is co-sponsored by Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), John Cornyn (R-TX) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI). It has been referred to the Committee on the Judiciary for further deliberation, but has a tremendous number of obstacles that must be overcome before reaching the President’s desk for final approval.",REGULATION,0.8876
2017/7/13,Some Small Movement in Cryptocurrency Regulatory Challenges This Week,"Theo Chino, a bitcoin advocate who has been fighting regulations in the U.S. for over two years, requested the withdrawal of the proposed “Uniform Regulation of Virtual Currency Businesses Act.”

Only July 7, 2017, Chino asked the Uniform Law Commission (ULC) to withdraw the proposed regulation on cryptocurrencies in the United States. The bitcoin advocate submitted a letter to the ULC asking to abandon the proposed statute. Chino argued that many of the states have “significant disagreements and approaches as to how to classify or regulate bitcoin.” In addition, there is a high level of legal uncertainty surrounding the proposed statute due to a legal challenge against the New York BitLicense — also known as the Virtual Currency Regulation — before the New York courts.

The legal challenge, which Chino cited in his letter to the ULC, is a lawsuit he initiated against the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”). In October 2015, Chino started an action against the NYDFS regarding BitLicense arguing that the agency “exceeded its regulatory mandate, and that regulating Bitcoin lies with the legislature, not NYDFS.”

“This proposed model statute, which is inspired by the New York BitLicense, will not only make it impossible for a small Bitcoin business to survive, but also will discourage the public to use Bitcoin. One does not have to look very far to understand why Bitcoin’s adoption is so low and so poor. This kind of arbitrary and negative intervention must stop,” said Chino.

In a post on Reddit, Chino stated he spoke twice with the chair of the Virtual Currency Committee. The chair of the committee told Chino he should take the case to a legal level if he disagrees with the proposed statute.

“This last conversation led me to believe that he [the chair of the committee] did not care about the academic search on the true nature of Bitcoin but is more interested in his personal notoriety as the chair of the committee. He really did not know how the technology really worked and why that act is bad,” Chino wrote on Reddit.
“He did admit that he represented the industry and not the individual small business.”

Coinbase
Coinbase, a digital currency exchange complying with the New York BitLicense, is currently under investigation by the Internal Revenue Service. However, this week it was reported that the IRS is scaling back the investigation. The IRS is now only seeking information on Coinbase users who were engaged in transactions of $20,000 or more. This means that the agency will exempt all the users who did not buy, sell, send or receive ""at least the equivalent of $20,000 in any one transaction type in any one year during the 2013-15 period.""

Bobby Lee on Need for Regulation
Earlier this year, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) halted the withdrawals of bitcoin at Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges, which also affected Bobby Lee’s company, BTCC. In an attempt to regulate the market, the PBOC created a task force for inspecting the trade of digital currencies. The goal of the task force is to ensure that cryptocurrency exchanges had implemented anti-money laundering systems. In the same month, the PBOC announced it had met with nine virtual currency exchanges to warn them about the consequences of violating the rules.

This move by the PBOC has been perceived as an attempt to crack down on the bitcoin trade, but Bobby Lee, the CEO of the Chinese bitcoin exchange BTCC, does not seem to share that view.

In contrast to what is coming out of the U.S., Lee said in a CNBC interview this week that cryptocurrencies are in need of more regulations. According to him, if there are no regulations, digital currencies can suffer high volatility.

""It's not really a crackdown,"" Lee said. ""The central bank previously was not very aware of the details of how bitcoin is utilized, how bitcoin is traded.""

However, Lee added that it is essential for regulators to take the time to come up with the “appropriate rules and laws to govern companies, how we do business, to govern individuals [and] how people conduct business online.”

""I think regulation is much needed for this new asset class because otherwise it'll run amok from society. But the challenge is how to craft the rules around this new technology.”",REGULATION,-0.9697
2017/7/26,SEC Weighs In on ICO Tokens as Securities; Ether Still Labeled “Currency”,"It was only a matter of time before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) moved in on the “Wild West” world of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), which has sent the blockchain world reeling. Yesterday, it finally did with its announcement that virtual tokens like the ones sold by the DAO are securities and now subject to federal securities laws.

The SEC statements reads in part: “federal securities laws apply to those who offer and sell securities in the United States, regardless whether the issuing entity is a traditional company or a decentralized autonomous organization, regardless whether those securities are purchased using U.S. dollars or virtual currencies, and regardless whether they are distributed in certificated form or through distributed ledger technology.”

The SEC is cautioning investors not only to be aware of the risks but also to ensure that those looking to get involved do their own due diligence as well.

One important distinction that seems to have emerged in the report, however, is that while DAO tokens are securities, Ether itself is still in the clear.

The Report seems to distinguish between Ether, labeled a virtual currency, and DAO Tokens, labeled a security. Market participants may take comfort in this distinction, as it supports the view that not all blockchain tokens are securities under the U.S. Federal Securities Laws. - Devebois & Plimpton LLC
The announcement, nevertheless, is expected to have an impact on token sales. As a result of this recent development, it is important to note that any company looking to raise capital through ICOs in the U.S. will have to take this SEC decision into consideration.

On the legal side, Louis Lehot of DLA Piper told Bitcoin Magazine: “Those considering a token offering would be well served to reconsider their plans and ensure compliance in all of these areas, from tip to tail.”

Lehot said: “The SEC’s release is most notable on its survey of many of the corollary issues which can be triggered under the federal securities laws when a token is deemed a security, from registration or exemption, whether general solicitation is permissible, to crowdfunding, to after-market trading and even addressed compliance issues under the 1940 Act.”

What Is “The Howey Test”?
The Howey test is the leading definition of an investment contract, referring to the U.S. Supreme Court case SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. Under the Howey test, an investment contract is “a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.”

According to Jaron Lukasiewicz, CEO of stealth blockchain project WORKFLOW and former investment banker, “The standard test is an investment in a business where the buyer has a reasonable expectation of profits based on the efforts of others. It should come as no surprise that the SEC found that buyers of the DAO Token purchased a security.”

He explained that the key feature of the DAO token was indeed an expectation of profit if the investments made by the DAO were successful, and so DAO tokens were expressly sold as an investment.  

Lukasiewicz added: “Unlike a token such as Ether, the DAO token had no other utility.  Many people in the industry at the time were concerned about the DAO for the reasons stated by SEC.”

Marco Santori, partner at Cooley LLP and legal ambassador for the Delaware Blockchain Initiative, shared an excellent summary of the report's key points on Twitter, touching chiefly on the distinction between tokens that are and are not securities. Arnold Spencer acts as general counsel for the Coinsource network of Bitcoin ATMs. He summed up the distinction in a succinct analogy:

If you buy an interest in a golf course to make money from the business, it is a financial investment and therefore a security. If you join a golf club to play golf, it is not a financial investment and not a security.
Important — but Not Surprising
Ron Chernesky, CEO of social trading platform investFeed, said that he welcomes the SEC announcement, although he also noted that “before yesterday’s announcement, it was common knowledge that ICOs have been enveloped in a regulatory [gray] area.”

It would appear that that gray area has now shrunk somewhat.",REGULATION,0.296
2017/7/31,Op Ed: Launching an ICO? Follow This Advice from the SEC,"Lost in the headlines over the SEC’s recent pronouncements on cryptocurrency was important practical advice for both promoters of and participants in initial coin offerings (ICOs).

Most coverage was rightfully garnered from the Report by the SEC’s enforcement division which deemed that DAO Tokens are securities, after subjecting the offering to the Howey test. However, the simultaneously issued Investor Bulletin should also be closely read by issuers of ICOs and their counsel.

Advice for Issuers and Counsel
Even though the bulletin was prepared as a cautionary statement to investors, it contains at least one disclaimer (in boldface type) that attorneys advising ICOs should add the following language to any offering document or white paper:

Investing in an ICO may limit your recovery in the event of fraud or theft. While you may have rights under the federal securities laws, your ability to recover may be significantly limited.
We have previously discussed the importance of these disclaimers and risk factors. By discussing the vulnerabilities of cryptocurrency exchanges and the potential difficulties associated with any recovery of invested or stolen funds, the SEC signals at least some of the risk factors counsel should consider adding to ICO offering materials.  

In fact, prudent attorneys advising their ICO clients would be wise to employ the cut-and-paste function, adding the above caveat to all their documents.

This additional wording is significant in that it spells out three key characteristics of ICOs:

(i) the difficulty of tracing or securing virtual currency;

(ii) the international scope of ICOs; and

(iii) the fact that lack of any central authority may limit an investor’s remedies against an issuer.

Practical Advice for Investors
Besides the usual bromides about being wary of any offer that sounds “too good to be true,” the SEC demonstrated an appreciation for the unique due diligence required in carefully evaluating an ICO.

According to the bulletin, investors should “ask whether the blockchain is open and public, whether the code has been published, and whether there has been an independent cybersecurity audit.” The SEC is communicating that those factors are indicative of companies whose products are verifiably real and secure.

Given the importance the SEC placed on these three items, rather than await questions, such points should be clearly addressed by an issuer in its ICO materials distributed to potential investors. Issuers of ICOs should include those factors and other “good facts” that can help to demonstrate their product’s value, security and legitimacy.

While the recent flurry of documents emanating from the SEC likely has given issuers of ICOs and their counsel pause (and caused them to walk each token through the Howey test), it does not appear to have stifled these transactions.

However, where the report reiterates the conceptual framework under which any potential token offering be evaluated to determine whether it constitutes a securities offering, the bulletin provides practical advice, and investors should expect to see some of the SEC’s language repeated in ICO offering documents going forward.",REGULATION,0.9501
2017/8/22,Russian Real Estate Firm Experiments With Selling a Luxury Mansion for Bitcoin,"The Russian real estate firm Kalinka Group has announced that once of its clients is selling his luxurious home for bitcoins. The 4200 square foot country mansion is located in the village of Nikolino, situated in a fashionable neighborhood off the Rublevo-Upenskoe highway. According to the Kalinka Group, this is the first time in the history of the Russian real estate market that a client has offered to sell a property for cryptocurrencies.

""Such transactions are still a novelty, even for world real estate markets,” Ekaterina Rumyantseva, the chairman of the board of Kalinka Group, said in a statement. “We are pleased to be pioneers and open new frontiers in business.”

She pointed out that Russian legislation has not yet defined the rules for working with bitcoins, and so far there is no legal definition of the cryptocurrency. Also, as there is no regulatory or legal framework governing the sale, the agency's service fees will still be paid in the national currency, rather than in bitcoin.

The legal department of the Kalinka Group is currently investigating whether the sale of a property for cryptocurrencies is legal, according to the laws of Russia.

The real estate firm cited China and Switzerland as examples of countries that consider bitcoin to be a tangible asset, which means a transaction is possible under the “barter agreement.”

However, if cryptocurrencies are considered cash in Russia, according to the law on foreign exchange operations, a transaction in BTC would be impossible since the only currency permitted in the sale of Russian real estate is the Russian ruble.

Kalinka Group recognized that volatility is another issue to consider when property sales are listed and transacted in cryptocurrencies. The real estate company acknowledged that bitcoin is much more volatile compared to other currencies, thus, exchanging the payment into rubles can “significantly change the value of the object.”

""The sale of the house in Nikolino will probably become a precedent in the legal practice and real estate market. We [will] carefully study the world experience of conducting such transactions and understand that cryptocurrencies should be described at the legislative level in the shortest possible time because this innovative method of settlement is already able to affect the money turnover in business,” Rumyantseva said.

Kalinka Group added that since bitcoin is volatile, the exact value of the designer-furnished mansion — which has an open-air jacuzzi and a movie theater along with many other luxurious features — will have to be determined at the moment of the sale. At the time of the announcement, the house was listed for 3000 BTC.",REGULATION,0.939
2017/8/30,Op Ed: Planning an ICO in Canada? Here are 10 Regulatory Points to Ponder,"Canada’s securities regulators are paying attention to ICOs. Last week they released a guidance document that explains their approach to token sales/ICOs/ITOs/crowdsales, officially titled “CSA Staff Notice 46-307: Cryptocurrency Offerings.” Here is what this notice means and what it doesn’t mean.

In the press release that accompanied the Staff Notice, Louis Morisset, the chair of the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) and the head of the Quebec securities regulator, is quoted as saying: “The technology behind cryptocurrency offerings has the potential to generate new capital-raising opportunities for businesses and we welcome this type of innovation …” The press release recommends the Staff Notice to anyone “… planning to raise capital through an ICO or ITO, or that is seeking to establish a cryptocurrency investment fund.”

The global legal backdrop to Staff Notice 46-307 is increased regulatory scrutiny of token offerings, including the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission report on “The DAO” issued last month and the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s issuance of a regulatory position.

Before diving into what the Staff Notice says, it’s important to understand what a Staff Notice is. The author of the Staff Notice is the CSA, an association of provincial and territorial securities regulators. Regulation of securities is conducted on a provincial basis and is not done at a country-wide level like in most jurisdictions. The CSA is a national forum for harmonizing securities rules and this Staff Notice is essentially a joint position on how Canada’s many securities regulators view ICOs.

The Staff Notice is interesting but it is not a legal change. It does not create any new rules in Canada but it does provide some clarity for anyone seeking to understand how Canadian securities law applies to token sales.  

Here are ten key takeaways from the CSA Staff Notice:

1. Regulators will treat each token using a case-by-case approach
A widespread fear in the blockchain industry is that regulators will somehow “shut down” token sales. The Staff Notice assuages that fear:

“Every ICO/ITO is unique and must be assessed on its own characteristics. For example, if an individual purchases coins/tokens that allow him/her to play video games on a platform, it is possible that securities may not be involved. However, if an individual purchases coins/tokens whose value is tied to the future profits or success of a business, these will likely be considered securities.”
This is a great paragraph to see. The regulators are communicating what any lawyer working in this area would have confirmed for a client: Some tokens are securities and some aren’t. This means that the regulators aren’t interested in a knee-jerk response that paints all token sales with the same broad brush.

2. Substance will trump form when it comes to ICOs
A security is not a security because of the words used but because of what it is. The Staff Notice includes a warning to this effect:

“Staff is aware of businesses marketing their coins/tokens as software products, taking the position that the coins/tokens are not subject to securities laws. However, in many cases, when the totality of the offering or arrangement is considered, the coins/tokens should properly be considered securities. In assessing whether or not securities laws apply, we will consider substance over form.”
An illegal securities offering can’t be dressed up to make it a legal product. A high-level staffer in the Ontario Securities Commission was quoted in the Globe and Mail on the same day that the Staff Notice was issued: “So what we’re trying to do is raise awareness that just because you’ve called something a coin or token doesn’t mean it’s now a loophole and you can go and promise your investors great returns, not provide any sort of documentation and not ensure what you’re selling to them is actually suitable for them.”

3. The CSA thinks many ICOs are securities offerings aimed at retail investors
Products are purchased. Capital is invested. When a store sells a good, they don’t consider that sale to be “investment.” Yet the world of ICOs is filled with references to token investors rather than token buyers. Many people speak of “raising capital” when they sell a token, while resisting the characterization of that transaction as the sale of securities. As the Staff Notice points out:

“ICOs/ITOs are generally used by start-up businesses to raise capital from investors through the internet. These investors are often retail investors.”
Many ICOs are being done in order to “raise capital,” rather than to create revenue through the sale of products, and the securities regulators have taken notice. The reference to “retail investors” acknowledges that most of the activity is taking place at the individual level rather than through institutional, large corporate or fund investments. This paragraph indicates that the CSA may view most ICOs/ITOs as securities offerings.

4. The existing legal framework for securities will be applied: Pacific Coin
A critical case in Canadian securities law is the 1978 Supreme Court decision of Pacific Coast Coin Exchange v. Ontario Securities Commission. This is the leading case on what a “security” is in Canada and it’s explicitly mentioned in the Staff Notice. The case lays out the following test:

“1. An investment of money 2. In a common enterprise 3. With the expectation of profit 4. To come significantly from the efforts of others.”
This test is similar to the Howey test in the United States. Note that this isn’t a “test” in the way that most people would understand that word. A legal test is a framework for decision-making that requires understanding the facts, circumstances and recent cases. Consultation with a lawyer will be necessary in order to understand how this test applies to any given situation — and even then it may not be clear.

Essentially, this section of the Staff Notice shows that they’re not planning a unique approach to ICOs. Token sales will be integrated into the existing legal rules for securities.

5. The Regulated System (or why white papers aren’t sufficient disclosure under Canadian securities law)
If a token is a security, that doesn’t necessarily mean that it can’t be sold. It does mean that if it’s sold there will be many rules to follow. The CSA helpfully explains the system in Canada for selling token-securities at a high-level:

“To date, no business has used a prospectus to complete an ICO/ITO in Canada. We anticipate that businesses looking to sell coins/tokens may do so under prospectus exemptions. Sales may be made to investors who qualify as ‘accredited investors’ as defined under securities laws, in reliance on the accredited investor prospectus exemption. For retail investors who do not qualify as accredited investors, sales will typically need to be made in reliance on the offering memorandum (OM) prospectus exemption.”
The above section is followed by a note that “white papers” are not sufficient disclosure to meet Canadian securities rules.

6. There are can be civil as well as regulatory consequences for non-compliance
What happens if Canadian securities rules aren’t followed? The CSA reminds people that beyond regulatory penalties there may be civil penalties:

“It should also be noted that investors may also have civil remedies against persons or companies that fail to comply with securities laws, including a right to withdraw from the transaction and/or damages for losses on the grounds that such transactions were conducted in breach of securities laws.”
The above warning applies to securities-related penalties/remedies. There may also be other civil causes of action generated by an improper sale. Canadian law has many opportunities for buyers to sue sellers for tricking them or not properly explaining what they were selling.

7. Cryptocurrency investment funds ought to follow the rules for funds too
One of the explicit audiences for the Staff Notice is people running or considering running cryptocurrency investment funds. Pages 5-6 have excellent information on what the legal compliance steps are for properly running a crypto fund in Canada.

8. Some token sales are securities offerings, and some token-securities are also derivatives
Securities can also be derivatives and there may be additional rules that apply. The CSA notes that there might be two sets of rules to follow:

“We note that these products may also be derivatives and subject to the derivatives laws adopted by the Canadian securities regulatory authorities, including trade reporting rules.”
9. Resale restrictions need to be considered for tokens that are securities
There is a paragraph in the Staff Notice that could be easily overlooked but contains a very useful tip for anyone designing token systems:

“Allowing coins/tokens that are securities issued as part of an ICO/ITO to trade on these cryptocurrency exchanges may also place the business issuing the coins/tokens offside securities laws. For example, the resale of coins/tokens that are securities will be subject to restrictions on secondary trading.”
This paragraph is a challenge to lawyers who are working on ICOs that are or may be securities. They will have to consider how the rules that apply to securities will be enforced by the system being deployed. How will resale restrictions imposed by securities laws be reflected in the technical system? Will we end up with a new ERC standard for regulated tokens that don’t permit transfer? Or that locks the token for a period of time? A token that doesn’t include the legal rules in its technical rules could end up creating legal trouble for the proponents.

10. The regulatory focus has shifted from crypto investment risks to tokens as securities
In 2014, the securities regulators (specifically, the Ontario Securities Commission) viewed digital currencies through the lens of transactions and speculation:

“Virtual (or digital) currencies like Bitcoin are being used as a type of money and offer a novel way to make purchases and transact business online. However, it remains unclear what virtual currency truly represents. Is it actually money? An investment? Something else? This is still a largely uncharted and unsupervised area, and no protections are likely available to you if you become involved with virtual currency and something goes wrong.”
The Staff Notice is a shift in thinking, away from the “buyer beware” stance that they held before and a recognition that blockchain development is rapidly moving beyond payments and into many other areas of the economy.",REGULATION,0.9994
2017/9/1,Israel Securities Authority to Form Committee to Oversee and Regulate ICOs,"In July, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) moved in on the ""Wild West"" world of ICOs, which has sent the blockchain world reeling. Now, the Israel Securities Authority (ISA) has announced its own plans to form a panel to regulate Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).

This week, the ISA announced that its chairman, Prof. Shmuel Hauser, has put together a committee to examine the regulation of ICOs. The committee will investigate the applicability of securities regulations on ICOs based on shared ledgers that are being offered to the Israeli public.

On July 31, the Israeli Bitcoin Association (IBA) made its own official public statement on the topic of ICOs. The IBA cautioned potential ICO participants that it’s important to understand the huge risks that exist in investing in ICOs.

This new world tends to captivate innocents tempted by the hope of getting rich quick. We implore the public considering investment in ICOs to treat the matter with serious consideration, out of a recognition that investors might lose all their money.
Regarding regulation, the Association cautioned that “the regulatory attitude towards this area is yet to be clarified. On one hand, this means investors will find it difficult to demand their rights, due to a lack of an appropriate infrastructure. On the other hand, it is possible that in the future there will be a regulatory intervention in a specific project or in the whole domain, which may hurt its continued operation.”

It seems that that time “in the future” for defined regulation is now in the works.

Udi Wertheimer, an Israeli blockchain researcher, read this latest announcement from the ISA in its original Hebrew and provided Bitcoin Magazine with his translation of the document.

“The announcement itself is neutral in tone,” Wertheimer told Bitcoin Magazine, “pointing out that the ISA is interested in encouraging new investment and funding options, and does not wish to stifle new innovations, but at the same time acknowledging that some ICOs turned out to be scams and others involved market manipulation, while yet others ended up being hacked in various ways, all leading to investor funds being lost.”

The document lays out its rationale as follows:

While considering the ISA’s policy in the last year on developing innovative funding models in parallel with keeping the interests of investors and warning from unregulated investments, it seems there’s a growing need of regulation in the field of ICOs. The committee’s job will include investigating this activity and the applicability of Israeli law as it exists today and as it may have to be adjusted, while reviewing their legal status in other countries.
“This is the first time I know of that Israeli authorities referred to ICOs directly. Israel is home to many ICOs, like Bancor, Kik’s Kin, Stox, CoinDash and others,” said Wertheimer.

He noted that the ISA recently cracked down on “binary options” companies, which tried to subvert security laws but were eventually identified as illegal. Even though these companies were registered elsewhere, the ISA forced them to shut down operations both in Israel and abroad. Wertheimer told Bitcoin Magazine: “Personally, I hope that regulators keep a hands-off approach in the near future, as I’m still hoping this field can still find a way to self-regulate. However, given the massive PR push by these ICOs both in Israel and internationally, I’m not surprised the ISA decided to take a close look.”

Meni Rosenfeld of the Israeli Bitcoin Association told Bitcoin Magazine that the Association has not yet formulated a stance on the ISA’s investigation.",REGULATION,0.3612
2017/9/6,Op Ed: Beware the Perils of Over-Regulation for ICOs,"Last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the gene drug Kymriah for certain types of cancer. However, Kymriah costs $475,000 for one single treatment, Bloomberg reports, which is well beyond being affordable for average patients.

In the U.S., the FDA approval process itself adds billions of dollars to drug development costs, which pharmaceutical companies must then recover, and also adds years to the drug availability timeline. The impression that suffering U.S. patients are required to pay exorbitant drug prices to support over-regulation is difficult to escape.

To operate beyond the reach of FDA regulations, Peter Thiel and other libertarian investors are funding an offshore human clinical trial of a herpes vaccine, TechCrunch reports. Thiel’s move has caused a stormy debate with clashes between opposite positions. See, for example, the opposite takes of DailyBeast and Reason.

There are many other examples of the harmful effects of over-regulation in the health sector, but these matters of life and death are too serious to be used for a political point. However, other sectors can illustrate the ethical and economical problems of over-regulation.

Take, for example, internet gambling, which is illegal in many jurisdictions including the U.S.

It’s worth noting that internet gambling is hugely popular, and the sector moves a lot of money. The ethical objection to making internet gambling illegal is easy to formulate: The adult citizens who want to gamble their own money online should be free to do so.

The economical objection is also easy to formulate: Adult citizens who want to gamble their own money online will find ways to do so, by using offshore service providers if there’s none at home or by going through Tor or a VPN if needed. But, if online gambling providers are forced to move offshore, they'll take a lot of jobs and a lot of money with them.

This is exactly what has happened in the online gambling sector, with many U.S. providers migrating to more gambling-friendly jurisdictions such as the U.K. Similarly, the Isle of Man government recognized internet gambling as a potential strategic growth sector and established a suitable legal and fiscal framework to attract online gambling and sports betting businesses. As a result, leading operators flocked to the island.

Since those U.S. residents who want to gamble online will do so anyway, the only effect of over-regulating the industry is to take money, jobs and technology offshore.

Actually, this is not entirely correct: Besides moving offshore, the less scrupulous operators also have the option of moving underground. In that case, it would force those who want to engage in totally harmless gambling to deal with a shady or even criminal underworld, which can be dangerous. This same point, which seems perfectly logical, is often made in support of drug liberalization.

Crypto Innovation Takes the Path of Least Resistance
After having introduced light and relatively permissive regulations to attract internet gambling operators, the Isle of Man adopted the same strategy for cryptocurrencies and digital fintech. Switzerland is following on the same path, with the “Crypto Valley” near Zug attracting more and more crypto-fintech operators.

Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and token sales are a relatively new crypto-fintech phenomenon that is attracting lots of attention from the press, from old and new businesses, and now from the regulators.

In July, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a first ruling which outlined that some tokens are to be considered as securities and subjected to rather strict SEC regulations. Other regulatory authorities, such as the Canadian Securities Administrators, are considering plans to follow suit.

On Monday, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) and Chinese regulatory bodies banned and deemed illegal the practice of raising funds through crypto-token ICOs, as reported by Reuters. This seems to conflict with recent, much more reasonable statements from the Director of PBoC’s Digital Currency Research Institute, which could indicate internal disagreement.

The regulators are mainly concerned with protecting gullible citizens from scams, which are inevitably common in the ICO scene. Perhaps the Chinese regulators are just temporarily freezing ICOs until they have a chance to put a sound regulatory framework in place. But it can be argued that, if their intention truly is to ban ICOs outright, then regulators are overreacting in ways that deny useful options to businesses and citizens alike.

According to the SEC and the CSA, only tokens with an underlying utility rather than a speculative investment value alone can escape being considered as securities. But, as always, the devil is in the details. If a token is really useful, its market value will go up, and speculative investors will profit. The question that comes to mind is, at which point does a useful token become a speculative investment? According to specialized lawyers, “the SEC has not provided a clear answer.”

“Obviously not everything that appreciates in value is a security,” notes crypto investor and CEO of 21.co, Balaji Srinivasan, in an insightful CNBC interview. “For example, a house can appreciate in value, but you can (and many people do) buy it for the use value.” But regulators could be tempted to follow China’s lead and consider all useful tokens as securities, which seems to be dangerous overkill.

The SEC regulations restrict investing in privately offered securities to “accredited investors.” But less than 10 percent of households in the U.S. are wealthy enough to qualify as such, and there are other strict requirements as well.

Therefore, if all useful tokens are considered as securities, the ability for creators of value to raise funds is significantly hampered, and average citizens are denied the opportunity to bet on innovative projects that could offer significant returns.

It’s now to be expected that Chinese crypto-token initiatives, including those that are not scams but are really innovative and promising projects, will move offshore and take jobs and money with them. Similarly, should U.S. crypto regulations become more restrictive, many U.S. companies could be tempted to follow the example of Xapo and relocate to Switzerland. Last week, blockchain company ShapeShift announced its decision to leave the State of Washington due to local over-regulation.

Srinivasan’s well-argued thesis is that crypto-tokens will democratize investment, open new fundraising options to businesses and new investment options to the public — including small businesses and average citizens — and turn the internet into the world's largest “stock” market.

“The regulatory framework will likely eventually accommodate this,” concludes Srinivasan. “Only a few countries need to allow it, and the consequent creation of wealth will be so large that it'll push many of the rest to have a liberal tokenization regime as well.”

The regulators should take this wise advice into account in formulating reasonable policies for the crypto-token sector, as well as the other sectors mentioned above.",REGULATION,0.9978
2017/9/8,Op Ed: China's ICO Ban Is Characteristic — Not Catastrophic,"The crypto market, especially in China, has been in a panic in these past few days, largely because of an official notice on Preventing Risks of Fundraising Through Coin Offering, jointly issued by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), the Cyberspace Administration of China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the China Banking Regulatory Commission, the China Securities Commission and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.

There seems to be a general fear that China’s attack on Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and tokens, often used to fund blockchain innovation and open up investment in blockchain technology to the masses, will stifle blockchain development and the industry as a whole in one of the world’s largest markets.

At first glance, the harshness of the statement seems to be comparable to the Chinese government’s 2013 warning that made bitcoin prices plummet immediately. However, those in the West who suspect that China is stifling Chinese innovation are underestimating the political wisdom of the Chinese government. Meanwhile, those in East critcizing China’s ICO policy for being too harsh as the government moves to protect the interests of private investors are ignoring the Chinese government’s history of decisiveness in tackling “illegal public funding” in recent decades.

Western critics should think about China’s economic development and gains during the past decades since a policy of openness was initiated in 1978; in this context, the government’s latest statment can be read for its underlying message. Eastern critics should understand that the Chinese government has zero tolerance for any activities that will jeopardize its financial stability.

The second-largest economy in the world managed to weather the financial crises of both 1997 and 2008: This was not simply chance. China’s economy is both innovative and ambitious. Since blockchain technology is acknowledged as the next-generation technological powerhouse, with the potential to reshape the way value is exchanged, there is no reason for China to do anything to harm blockchain innovation. China is not cracking down on blockchain technology: It is actually poised to lead blockchain development not only in its own country, but also around the world.

Breaking Down the Language
First, though the original text is subtle, it is crucial to note that PBOC’s statement on September 4 only targets illegal ICOs instead of targeting blockchain companies as a whole. The translation of original text is: “No organizations or individuals shall conduct any illegal token financing activities (ICO).” The underlying interpretation is that where there are illegal ICOs, there will also be legal ICOs (or “token financing atctivities”), which requires the introduction of new regulations.

Besides avoiding the use of the word “blockchain” itself, the statement also reveals another subtlety: It uses the term “virtual currencies” to refer to all ICO tokens. This word choice is particularly telling. In the past, when People’s Daily, the party-run newspaper, described bitcoin as “digital gold” ― for instance, in an article published in May ― it used the term “digital currency.” It is important to interpret the Chinese language, especially specific word choices made by official sources, very carefully. By choosing to use the word “virtual,” a word implying “unreal” and “insubstantial” in Chinese, the legitimacy of ICO tokens has already been undermined.

Second, what happened in the Chinese crypto market in the past few months has impacted the government’s bottom line: Its financial stability has been threatened. Although many Westerners in the crypto space are familiar with a few Chinese projects like NEO and Qtum, the Chinese crypto market has actually witnessed the recent advent of more than 65 ICO projects, with around $400 million raised, according to a report issued by National Committee of Experts on Internet Financial Security Technology.  

The absolute number is not enormous, but the key is that most of these projects are unreliable and even fraudulent, with no open-source codes and sometimes without any white paper. Some projects even provide huge discounts to pre-ICO investors ― thereby dooming those who joined the official ICO to lose money, even after building up hopes of 10x returns. It is this sort of irresponsible behavior that compelled the government to step in before anything more extreme happened.

Furthermore, any financial activities involving financing from the public are particularly suspect in the eyes of the Chinese government. Wu Ying, once China’s most successful businesswoman, was sentenced to life in prison in 2014 for “illegal funding from the public.” Also, E Zubao, once the country’s biggest online lender, was condemned by Chinese authorities as a Ponzi scheme after the company was found to have squandered the money raised from the public (which should have been used to match investors to potential borrowers). The losses can be considerable: Around $7.6 billion was involved in the E Zubao case, for instance.

Past transgressions like these are chiefly to blame for China’s current suspicion of ICOs. It is perhaps no surprise, in other words, that the government is declaring ICOs to be illegal, while requiring the return of all tokens to investors. China is being characteristically cautious regarding anything posing potential risks to its financial stability.

Third, while China still encourages innovation within the blockchain industry, it needs a regulated crypto market. It may regulate ICOs, the exchanges, and information disclosure channels. But the reason behind this regulation stems from a need to create a sound environment for blockchain development in China.

According to China’s Premier Li Qeqiang last year ― in the government’s 13th Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development ― blockchain technology has been listed as an important area of development for Chinese endeavors. This overtly positive support of blockchain technology will not be changed easily. Other evidence of official support of blockchain technology abounds. For instance, a news program on CCTV stated that China is only pausing ICOs, not banning them outright. And the news section of the official site of the Chinese government also reposted an article stating that “China can potentially become the leader in blockchain industry.” (See image below.) These are all subtle signals that China is preparing for a better blockchain world.

In the blockchain session of the Global Digital Marketing Summit, held by the Guiyang government in western China in July this year, the government also mentioned that a “sandbox mechanism” will become an important step for investors to invest in projects without worrying about policy risk (as the sandbox will allow for a more open space for qualified projects to be promoted and financed).   ICOs are among the first experiments for the blockchain industry to explore its own business and financing models. It is normal that a new industry and its encumbent business model will find itself in conflict with the existing laws of a given country at some point. To make some corrections and to embrace compliance guidelines will not harm the industry in the long run.

China’s attitude toward blockchains and ICOs has had such an impact on the global token price that it has actually affirmed the importance of China’s role in the industry. Its recent policy is an attempt to maintain financial stability and set the tone for the future of the industry in China.

Fears that China will confine or even kill the blockchain industry are not tenable. Furthermore, China has a large and solid foundation of internet and mobile device users, and a world-class level of infrastructure. If the blockchain industry really has the potential to further improve human commerce and civilization, China’s market will serve as the best test case.

Even if in the end, the new policy makes it harder for blockchain projects to be financed in China, when one considers that internet giants like Alibaba, Tencent and Jingdong have all based their businesses in China but found financing mainly outside the country, there is really no need to worry about the development of blockchain in China ― let alone the rest of the world.

2017/9/19,Uncertainty Dominates as China Continues to Clamp Down on Cryptocurrencies,"China is clamping down on cryptocurrency, that much is clear. But while the developing story dominates headlines, a notable trend is the lack of official information. Chinese officials seem to systematically decline requests for comments, local sources are willing to provide information on condition of anonymity only, while leaked documents remain unverified.

Despite this lack of clarity, here’s what’s known so far.

Effects on Trading
The most important thing we know for sure is that Chinese bitcoin exchanges will be closing down, or at least exiting China.

BTCC — the oldest bitcoin exchange in the world — was the first exchange to announce they’d be closing shop within the Asian country, by the end of this month. The exchange cited guidelines published by the Chinese central bank (the People’s Bank of China; PBOC), which initially appeared to only affect ICOs, as its reason for closing down.

Other exchanges quickly followed BTCC's lead. ViaBTC and Yunbi both announced that they’d be ceasing operations by the end of this month. Huobi and OKCoin, the two other major Chinese exchanges, announced they would be shutting down too, though not until the end of October. And BitKan, a big over-the-counter (OTC) trading service rather than an order-book exchange, announced it would be shutting down as well.

While the cited guidelines initially did not seem to concern bitcoin, it is likely that Chinese officials have made it clear through separate channels that they do apply to the cryptocurrency. Bloomberg (among others) reports that exchange operators decided to close down after in-person meetings with PBOC officials, and the Wall Street Journal reports — based on anonymous sources — that the PBOC has prepared a set of “draft instructions” that would ban cryptocurrency trading altogether. These draft instructions have also been leaked (translation) but have so far not been verified for authenticity.

The content of the leaked documents is also consistent with warnings issued by a Chinese quasi-regulatory body — the National Internet Finance Association of China (NIFA) — regarding cryptocurrency trading, published shortly before exchanges announced that they would be shutting down.

According to the NIFA, Bitcoin exchanges lack “legal basis” to operate in the country. Additionally, NIFA official Li Lihui told a technology conference in Shanghai on Friday that a goal of China’s monetary regulation is to ensure that “the source and destination of every piece of money can be tracked.”

The Status of Bitcoin
As far as official statements go, Bitcoin itself is not banned in China. Owning, using, and — most importantly — mining bitcoin should technically not be affected by the published guidelines.

However, more unverified reports (translation) consistent with reporting from the Wall Street Journal, claim that Bitcoin itself will be blocked by the so-called “great firewall of China.” Specifically, seed addresses, which help to bootstrap any new Bitcoin node, and Bitcoin blocks, necessary to construct the blockchain, would be filtered from internet traffic into China, using deep packet inspection.

Additionally, major foreign Bitcoin exchanges like Coinbase, Bitfinex and LocalBitcoins would be added to the list of banned domains, which already includes sites like Google and Facebook. And even private trading of cryptocurrency arranged through chat-apps like Telegram and WeChat, for example, could fall under scrutiny, according to the Wall Street Journal.

This much stricter stance on Bitcoin, beyond just exchanges but also concerning Bitcoin itself, seem consistent with comments from PBOC Counselor Sheng Songcheng, as reported by local news sources like Shanghai Securities News. Songcheng was quoted to have said that Bitcoin poses a challenge to China, mentioning money laundering and its potential to curb the nation’s economic policy.

Furthermore, very recent reports indicate that cryptocurrency exchange operators are currently not allowed to leave Beijing. Local news outlet BJ News writes:

“[According to] a number of informed sources, the current special currency trading platform executives and so on are not allowed to leave Beijing, [in order] to cooperate with the investigation. In accordance with regulatory requirements, the trading platform shareholders, the actual controller, executives, financial executives [must] fully cooperate with the relevant work in the clean-up period in Beijing.” (Rough translation.)

What This Means…
Trading bitcoin via dedicated exchange platforms in China is off the table for now — that is clear.

But it’s not yet clear how successful a full Chinese Bitcoin blockade could be. It would technically only require a single Bitcoin block of a maximum of four megabytes to make it into China about once every 10 minutes, potentially even through satellite, for the entire country to be able to access the blockchain. As such, banning individual Chinese citizens from owning and using bitcoin might prove difficult, even if exchange platforms close down.

Perhaps an even more important question is what will happen to Bitcoin mining: It’s likely that most of Bitcoin’s hash power is currently situated in the Asian country. While miners should able to connect to the rest of the world, according to ViaBTC CEO Haipo Yang, it’s unclear if this connection will be allowed for much longer. If Chinese authorities indeed intend to ban Bitcoin from the country entirely, some Bitcoin mining operations — both mining pools and hash power data centers — will be easy targets to shut down.

On the other hand, this is not the first time that fears of China “banning Bitcoin” have been raised. In the past, such concerns have simply been a prelude to stricter regulations by local authorities.

It has been suggested by Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu, perhaps a bit optimistically, that exchanges will simply require a new license to continue operation. Similarly, it’s been speculated that the PBOC may introduce a national digital currency as a sort of gateway to cryptocurrency: This would allow the central bank to better track the flow of funds in and out of bitcoin in order to counter money laundering and capital flight.

Then again, it could make more sense to introduce such a national digital currency as a substitute for Bitcoin, once Bitcoin is effectively banned, as suggested by ZeroHedge.

2017/10/2,"South Korea's ICO Ban: A Reaction to ""Serious Concerns"" Over Cryptocurrency Investment Practices","The South Korean Financial Services Commission (FSC) has announced it will ban all forms of initial coin offerings (ICOs). After a meeting to discuss virtual currency control, the vice-chairman of financial affairs, Kim Yong-bum, made this comment as part of an official statement:

“We expressed a serious concern that the recent inflow of funds into the nonproductive speculative direction is showing up. As a result, we believe that additional measures are inevitable in order to switch to productive investment.”
The statement concludes by saying:

“All forms of ICO prohibition including securities issuance [and] monetary lending and coin margins are prohibited, blocking all business related business alliances.”
Korean blockchain expert and entrepreneur Ash Han told Bitcoin Magazine that “the FSC is concerned about ignorant investors becoming victimized by scammers using crypto.” Specifically, Han is referring to multi-level marketing or network marketing, an infamous way to raise money using existing distributors to recruit new distributors. This type of business strategy is often fraught with pyramid schemes in which raising money from new recruits buying in is the primary focus of the business instead of actual product development and sales.

Because the FSC has judged that virtual currencies such as bitcoin and ether are electronic representations of value and not financial products such as securities, the government has chosen to indirectly regulate virtual currencies through banks.

In addition to the FSC, several government organizations including the Korean Fair Trade Commission (KFTC), the National Tax Service (Korean IRS) and the police have formed a joint inspection system that will examine the current conditions of virtual currency exchanges through on-site inspections.

The FSC will examine the customer information leakages caused by hacking, strengthen penalties for similar behavior to prevent money laundering, and open a joint inspections system with several other government entities to examine the current conditions of digital currency traders and exchanges. The joint inspection system will also examine the regulatory and taxation trends of other countries and international organizations to form consensus on the character of virtual currency trade and taxation.

Until December, virtual currencies such as bitcoin and ether will be traded on an exchange only if a bank has confirmed the authorization of an account.  

“We will begin the transaction by checking the identity of the bank account and monitoring the flow of funds,” stated an official from the Financial Services Commission. According to Han, employing banks to keep track of all new accounts opened on exchanges will permit the FSC’s further investigation of violations regarding Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols. The only change for virtual currency exchange customers is that now these customers need to be able to prove that the bank accounts they have connected to an exchange belong to them.

While these new regulations could be efforts to correct South Korea’s frenzied ICO market, Han points out that if the South Korean authorities tightened control over virtual currencies much like China, they could “put a huge tax on crypto-related activities.”

Jay Kim, a.k.a The Crypto Lark, a Korean digital currency YouTube host, says the country’s ICO ban will not affect individual investors who participate in foreign ICOs. “In Korea, people actively investing in ICOs will not be affected. The government is concerned with scams. I think it’s a temporary measure until there are some regulations in place for ICOs.”

Scams and Bad Actors
This news comes as no surprise given an overall global move to regulate ICOs in some way. China has banned the issuance of virtual currencies as illegal public funding. In July, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued a warning that token sales would be regulated as securities and thus would have to comply with reporting and consumer protection requirements. On August 1, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) clarified that the issue of digital tokens would be regulated by MAS if the digital tokens constitute products regulated under the Securities and Futures Act.

Also, the South Korean digital currency exchanges have been consistently targeted by hackers over the last several months. According to a report by security firm FireEye, North Korea has been targeting digital currency exchanges since April 2017.

Since May 2017, North Korean actors have targeted at least three South Korean digital exchanges with the intent of stealing funds. This type of attack has been predominantly targeted at the “personal email accounts of South Korean employees of digital exchanges using a tax-themed lure to deploy malware.”

On July 5 2017 Bithumb was victim to a major hack. Bithumb remains South Korea’s largest digital currency exchange, the world’s second-largest Ethereum exchange by daily volume. At the time of the hack, 13.5 percent of the the total ether market was going through Bithumb’s exchange. Attacks such as this one would certainly have attracted scrutiny from Korea’s Internet and Security Agency.

Growth and Opportunity
This latest blow to South Korea’s cryptocurrency community comes at a time of recent growth and opportunity, despite the persistent scams and hacks of bad actors. Since China’s ICO ban in early September, South Korea has quickly been overtaking China in daily trading volume of digital currencies.

The country’s connection to the internet and technology in general cannot be underestimated. According to a 2015 study by content delivery network Akamai, South Korea had the fastest internet speed in the world based on the unique IP count, and its largest export company, Samsung Electronics, made a profit of $16.5 billion USD in 2016.

South Korea’s third-largest exchange, Coinone, recently opened “the world’s first blockchain 4D zone,” a brick-and-mortar exchange complete with a bitcoin ATM, a large display with real-time market information and a face-to-face consultation service.

The South Korean fintech firm Dunamu has announced the launch of a new crypto-trading platform through a partnership with the U.S.-based exchange Bittrex. The platform, called Upbit, will be released in beta in October. It will support over 110 different digital currencies including bitcoin, litecoin, ripple and ether.

In terms of popularity, the digital currency community in Seoul alone is enormous with 16 registered cryptocurrency Meetups, the largest of which is the Seoul Ethereum Meetup with approximately 3,550 members. In the past year the government has even taken part in the digital currency industry by auctioning off confiscated bitcoin.",REGULATION,-0.9125
2017/10/3,Op Ed: Where Pseudonymous Cryptocurrency Transactions Meet AML Reporting Requirements,"Two months ago, the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”), working with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California (“USAO”), assessed a civil money penalty of over $110 million against BTC-e (aka Canton Business Corporation) for willfully violating U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) laws. Alexander Vinnik, a Russian national who was one of the operators of BTC-e, was arrested abroad and indicted for conspiracy and money laundering in connection with facilitating more than $4 billion in ransomware payouts and other related financial crimes focused on individuals who engage in activities ranging from computer hacking to drug trafficking.

The prosecution of BTC-e by FinCEN and Vinnik by the USAO should be no surprise. BTC-e was an alleged hub of criminal activity. Businesses operating in the digital currency space may look at these prosecutions and find them insignificant because the alleged conduct is not conduct in which they are engaged, and they are good corporate citizens who do not facilitate criminal activity. But these prosecutions remind us that the advent of Bitcoin and other digital currencies (sometimes referred to as virtual currencies, cryptocurrencies, altcoins or tokens) raises a serious issue: When do businesses in the digital currency space become “financial institutions” that must collect and retain information about their customers and share that information with FinCEN in accordance with the federal Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”)?

Real lessons can be learned from re-examining FinCEN’s 2013 guidance, entitled “Application of FinCEN’s Regulations to Persons Administering, Exchanging, or Using Virtual Currencies,” and revisiting the prosecution of Ripple Labs, Inc., (“Ripple”) by FinCEN in coordination with the USAO, which Ripple settled in 2015. FinCEN’s action against Ripple was the first civil enforcement action against a virtual currency exchange for failing to implement an effective AML program and failing to report suspicious activity related to certain financial transactions. FinCEN’s recent action against BTC-e was the first time FinCEN prosecuted a foreign entity operating as a “money services business” as defined under the BSA. FinCEN asserted jurisdiction over BTC-e because BTC-e processed nearly $300 million in transactions involving U.S. customers.

Compliance with the BSA is a particularly sensitive topic in the digital currency industry because digital currency transactions are recorded on a blockchain, a distributed electronic ledger, which contains no personally identifiable information (“PII”), and thus digital identities are concealed. The BSA mandates record-keeping and reporting requirements for certain transactions, including the identity of an individual engaged in the transaction, by financial institutions through the use of Currency Transaction Reports (“CTRs”), Suspicious Activity Reports (“SARs”), Currency or Monetary Instrument Reports (“CMIRs”) and Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts Reports (“FBARs”). After the September 11, 2001, attacks, the Patriot Act amended the BSA by adding know-your-customer (“KYC”) reporting requirements that include enhanced due-diligence policies, procedures and controls that are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering or terrorist financing.

The BSA applies to “financial institutions” (as defined in the statute), and most digital currency businesses fall into the “money transmitter” (“MT”) or “money services business” (“MSB”) categories of financial institutions regulated under the BSA. In 2013, FinCEN issued guidance and statements that it would enforce AML requirements against MTs and MSBs operating in the digital currency space, particularly with respect to exchanges on which virtual currencies trade, and on systems providing services for such exchanges. Individual investors need not fear — an individual (or company) can invest in digital currency and sell those currencies for profit without complying with the BSA. However, a company that helps others buy, sell or send digital currency by “accepting and transmitting” digital currency must comply with the BSA.

“Accepting and transmitting” means that a company receives digital currency from one customer and sends it on their behalf to another person. Merely giving digital currency to someone or accepting digital currency from someone — for example, as a method of payment — does not mean you are a “financial institution” under the BSA. In addition, those who develop and distribute software to facilitate the sale of digital currency do not need to comply with the BSA. But, an exchanger who “buys and sells [digital currency] ... for any reason,” such as providing a brokerage or exchange service for customers, is subject to the BSA.

In addition, given the wave of recent initial coin offerings (“ICOs”) in which digital currencies used for various purposes are offered to the public for sale, it is important to note that a digital currency need not be used like fiat currency in order to be subject to the BSA — it simply needs to be used as “value” that “substitutes for currency.”

There is conflicting guidance on whether the offerers of digital currency who sell their own tokens to U.S. citizens are subject to the BSA. However, FinCEN has advised that a company selling digital currency from its own account is not subject to BSA reporting requirements.

Notwithstanding that guidance, in FinCEN’s 2015 settlement with Ripple, it alleged that Ripple’s mere sale of XRP, its own digital currency, rendered Ripple an MSB that violated the BSA by failing to register with FinCEN, and by failing to implement and maintain an adequate AML program. Of course, Ripple is a currency exchange that would ordinarily be subject to the BSA, but the fact that FinCEN’s settlement with Ripple specifically alleges that Ripple’s sale of XRP violated the BSA raises issues of risk and uncertainty from a legal standpoint for digital currency offerers with respect to compliance with the BSA.

In conclusion, companies that operate or are considering operating in the digital currency space should conduct a thorough analysis of anti-money laundering regulations to understand potential registration requirements with FinCEN and whether they are required to implement AML policies and procedures to comply with the BSA.",REGULATION,0.2766
2017/10/4,"Op Ed: The SEC Is Watching Cryptocurrencies, So Beware — But Don't Overreact","A startling trend has recently emerged in the cryptocurrency industry. Since July 2017, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has regularly begun asserting itself in this space. It has taken various actions against several companies relating to their Initial Coin Offerings, or “ICOs,” or other cryptocurrency activities. It investigated The DAO, an online corporation, and declared that its ICO involved securities subject to regulation under federal securities laws. It also suspended trading in the stock of four other companies due to concerns over the accuracy of public information relating to their cryptocurrency activities. What does this trend mean for the industry? Looking more closely at the SEC’s actions, the answer is: to be vigilant but not paranoid.

The DAO Legacy
Federal securities laws generally require that instruments constituting “securities” are registered with the SEC in order to protect investors by ensuring public access to key information needed for making an informed investment decision. On July 25, 2017, the SEC issued a Report of Investigation on The DAO, concluding that DAO Tokens sold in its ICO were “investment contracts” and therefore securities that should have been registered.

The DAO (short for Decentralized Autonomous Organization) sold over one billion DAO Tokens in exchange for ether. The proceeds were to be used to fund various “projects” once they were vetted and approved by Curators, who were selected by The DAO’s founders. DAO Token holders could vote on which projects to fund, and profits from those projects would be distributed among Token holders.

Applying the Howey test (named for the Supreme Court case that announced it), which says that something is an investment contract if it involves (1) an investment of money (2) in a common enterprise (3) with a reasonable expectation of profits derived from the managerial efforts of others, the SEC found that DAO Tokens were securities because:

Purchasing DAO Tokens in exchange for ether constituted an “investment of money”;

A “common enterprise” existed because the ether was pooled and used to fund projects aimed at making profits, which would be distributed to DAO Token holders; and

DAO Token holders expected these profits from the efforts of The DAO founders and Curators, who, among other things, created and monitored The DAO and vetted potential projects. While Token holders could vote on which projects to fund, they were still essentially relying on others, because they could vote only after projects had been curated.

Although these findings applied only to The DAO, the SEC noted that it wanted “to stress that the U.S. federal securities law may apply to various activities, including distributed ledger technology, depending on the particular facts and circumstances, without regard to the form of the organization or technology used to effectuate a particular offer or sale.” This declaration undoubtedly foreshadows continued investigations and enforcement actions relating to ICOs.

Trading Suspensions
Federal law authorizes the SEC to suspend trading in a company’s stock summarily for up to 10 business days when needed to protect investors or in the public interest. In a recent Investor Alert, the SEC explained that such suspensions may result from a “lack of current, accurate, or adequate information about the company”; “questions about the accuracy of publicly available information” concerning the company’s “operational status and financial condition”; or “questions about trading in the stock.” In the cryptocurrency context, the SEC is especially concerned about scams in which companies “publicly announc[e] ICO or coin/token related events to affect the price of the company’s common stock.” It warned specifically about two red flags signaling possible “ICO-related fraud”: companies whose stock is trading that (1) claim without explanation that their ICO is “SEC-compliant” or (2) “purport[] to raise capital through an ICO or take on ICO-related business described in vague or nonsensical terms or using undefined technical or legal jargon.”

In August 2017, the SEC issued 10-day suspension orders in shares of four companies due to concerns relating to public statements about their cryptocurrency activities and ICOs. First, on August 3, the SEC suspended trading in shares of Strategic Global Investments, Inc., over questions regarding the accuracy of statements in certain press releases relating to “the activities of the company with respect to [ICOs].” Each of the cited press releases touted generally that the company planned to sponsor “SEC compliant ICOs.”

Next, on August 9, the SEC issued a temporary trading ban in shares of CIAO Group (recently renamed as NuMelo Technology) due to questions regarding the accuracy of various public statements relating to certain business plans and a planned ICO. The cited press releases, including those from March 16, June 15 and July 6, contained vague statements that CIAO planned to invest in telecommunications projects in emerging markets and to facilitate the provision of financial services to developing nations through blockchain technology, including through an ICO.

On August 23, the SEC suspended trading in shares of First Bitcoin Capital Corp., a company involved in developing digital currencies and other blockchain technology, due to “concerns regarding the accuracy and adequacy of publicly available information about the company including, among other things, the value of [its] assets and its capital structure.”

Finally, on August 24, the SEC issued a suspension order against American Security Resources Corp. (renamed to Bitcoin Crypto Currency Exchange Corp.) due to statements in press releases “concerning, among other things, the company’s business transition to the cryptocurrency markets and early adoption of blockchain technology.” These press releases from August 1 and August 8 announced vaguely that the company was “enter[ing] the booming Crypto currency markets,” developing a mobile cryptocurrency trading application and acquiring a company that had created “a smartphone-based payment and money transfer system.”

The SEC’s suspension orders did not specify the language or facts triggering its action, but each of these companies appears to have strayed into the red-flag territory the SEC has identified. Its oversight in this area will thus likely continue and be directed at preventing fraud and improving disclosures to investors on new or not-well-understood technologies.

Implications for the Cryptocurrency Industry
This recent flurry of SEC activity should be taken seriously by the cryptocurrency industry because it is only the start. The SEC will continue to monitor businesses involved with cryptocurrencies. Companies considering engaging in ICOs should therefore carefully consider and seek legal advice regarding whether their tokens possess characteristics that might make them resemble securities. They should also consult counsel when preparing public statements relating to their cryptocurrency activities or assets.

Anyone predicting the beginning-of-the-end for the industry based on these events, however, is overreacting. As more businesses become engaged in cryptocurrency-related activities, more people will buy tokens or invest in companies innovating within the cryptocurrency space, which ignites regulators’ investor-protection instincts. While the SEC has bared its teeth where it perceived a threat to investors, it has not demonstrated aggression toward the industry as a whole. Indeed, the SEC was careful not to say that ICOs categorically involve securities; it cautioned only that whether a token is a security depends on the “facts and circumstances” of each case. That the SEC is watching the cryptocurrency industry is thus a symptom of the industry’s success, not a sign of its demise.",REGULATION,0.1877
2017/10/25,TokenFunder Wins Approval to First OSC Regulated ICO Launch,"In Canada, steps are being taken to bring Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) within the regulatory framework. TokenFunder, a Toronto-based startup that helps other startups launch and manage ICOs, is the first company to win approval for an ICO by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC).

While some ICOs have come under regulatory scrutiny lately, TokenFunder CEO Alan Wunsche believes that ICOs can be done right, with built-in safeguards to avoid fraud.

Wunsche said in a press release issued to Bitcoin Magazine:

“TokenFunder has been working with the Ontario Securities Commission’s LaunchPad for the past year to define an innovative funding model for businesses. Our offering will give investors the comfort of knowing that they are purchasing a security that can stand up to the scrutiny of regulation.”

TokenFunder ICO Launches November 1
The OSC decision allows TokenFunder Inc. to launch their ICO November 1, selling FNDR tokens to retail investors who can then launch their own ICOs on TokenFunder’s platform which is being built on the Ethereum blockchain.

TokenFunder was given “relief” for a year from current regulations covering investors. This includes an exemption from registering as an investor and an exemption from a limit to the amount that can be raised in one offering.

Wunsche notes that many firms using ICOs to raise investment funding are not able to verify where the funds are coming from making it risky to raise money this way. He believes that there is a safe way to use ICOs and is offering the expertise to provide investor protection within a sound regulatory framework.

Like many jurisdictions around the world, the Ontario government is looking for ways to regulate ICOs without stifling innovation and driving startups to other jurisdictions.

To date, some startups are holding ICOs without regulatory approval saying that their tokens or coins are not securities.

What TokenFunder Is Selling
TokenFunder offers an ICO process that they claim will build trust in digital finance through the use of best practices, including smart contracts to build in legal compliance and regulatory compliance to ensure that investor’s rights are protected.

TokenFunder offers token launch advisory services and is designed to operate within applicable securities laws and de-risk offerings and purchases of coins for both issuers and purchasers by providing, among other things, a regulatory approved platform and related support.

TokenFunder co-founder Laura Pratt said in a press release:

“A unique feature of our FNDR token is that it lets investors share in the future success of the platform. TokenFunder has innovative KYC and AML compliance safeguards, which investors don’t receive with unregulated ICOs. After the completion of our ITO, our vision is to enable other companies to launch ITO’s using our platform. It is a myth that regulation is in the way... it’s the right way.”

LaunchPad Regulatory Sandbox
TokenFunder is a graduate of the OSC’s regulatory sandbox, part of the Canadian Securities Commission network of sandbox initiatives.

LaunchPad is the Ontario sandbox with largely provincial jurisdiction but is also part of the federal securities experimental program. Its goal is to help new fintech startups work outside the current regulatory system and navigate a financial terrain that is largely based on traditional systems that may not work for new cryptocurrency and blockchain startups.

The Blockchain Association of Canada (BAC) has been lobbying the province’s finance minister and others for more appropriate regulations for the new digital age.

Executive Director Kyle Kemper, on behalf of the BAC told Bitcoin Magazine:

""This is a first step in building a common understanding between all stakeholders around the potential, risks and opportunities of the token economy.

“This ruling demonstrates that the OSC is adapting to a changing landscape and recognizes the need to support entrepreneurs leveraging blockchain technology. The Blockchain Association of Canada looks forward to assisting in developing a regulatory environment that supports continued innovation. The BAC congratulates the TokenFunder team for achieving this impressive milestone.”",REGULATION,0.7783

         New “Semi-Decentralized” Cryptocurrency Exchange Navigates Murky Compliance Waters
        
Tetra, a new entrant in the cryptocurrency exchange sector, describes itself as a semi-decentralized, peer-to-peer exchange with an emphasis on security and usability: “Tetra will help create the next wave of cryptocoin adoption which will benefit all cryptocurrency users from investors to traders to businesses.”

The term “peer-to-peer exchange” tends to suggest the idea of a strong emphasis on privacy and anonymity, as well as a certain level of disdain for Know-Your-Customer (KYC) rules, meddling regulators and authorities. According to Tetra’s blog post announcement, however, it appears that its approach is at odds with this philosophy:

Tetra understands the importance of practices like KYC and has devoted the resources necessary to implement these processes properly. Users will be able to trade safely with the comfort of knowing that due diligence has been enacted to protect them from potential repercussions.

“You may have heard the terrifying accounts of people receiving prison sentences for trading cryptocurrencies on peer-to-peer exchanges,” adds the main Tetra website. “With Tetra, that is a thing of the past. Route your payments through our fully compliant banking network for a legally sound trading process. We're relieving traders of the burden of obtaining expensive licenses and adhering to cumbersome regulations in order to allow people to focus on what matters: their trades.”

While this sounds appealing to compliance-conscious cryptocurrency users and traders, the self-description of Tetra as a “semi-decentralized P2P” raises questions. In a Reddit discussion, a Tetra representative admits that Tetra is a centralized service, but states that the exchange operates using a decentralized transaction model so that the operators never have control over users’ coins directly, and thus hackers do not have access to users’ coins.

In communication with Bitcoin Magazine, Patrick O'Brien and CTO of Tetra Exchange, confirmed this practice.

""Tetra is called a semi-decentralized exchange because Tetra customers maintain control over their own private keys. Customer funds are never stored on our centralized servers, users store their funds in their own client-side wallets which are built into the Tetra software, and transact through our system by utilizing the Bitcoin network's multi-signature transaction architecture.”

He explained that Tetra is described as a peer-to-peer exchange because users are trading with other individuals, and not with Tetra or against a Tetra orderbook as they would in a traditional exchange.

“To elaborate further, this means that when customers are interested in making escrow payments they will participate in a multi-signature transaction, with the third party and ourselves as signing authorities,” continued O'Brien.

“In the event of a dispute we can co-operate with either side to move the funds where they need to go, and in the event of a successful transaction both sides can agree to release the funds. All of this is accomplished without us ever having direct control over the flow of money as would be the case in a traditional exchange.”

International Compliance Issues
Based in British Columbia, Canada, Tetra plans to operate globally with no restrictions, unless forced to by law. When a Reddit user suggested that Tetra is advising traders to flaunt U.S. money transmission laws, the Tetra representative answered that the exchange is not “ignoring U.S. laws and pretending it's Canadian law while intending to operate in the U.S.”

He added that the exchange takes compliance very seriously and stated that Tetra is circling back to their lawyers for advice.

However, as the Reddit thread continues to point out, there still remains a number of compliance and personal privacy concerns related to the company’s KYC measures that U.S. users should be especially wary of, depending on the particular state requirements where they live.

Some states are stricter than others, too. Always [know] one's own jurisdictional rules/laws and not rely on what is ""too good to be true."" - coin_trader_LBC

User Experience and Security
Leaving aside the P2P interpretation and the potential compliance minefield, it’s worth noting that Tetra emphasizes easy usability and security as strong competitive advantages in the cryptocurrency exchange market.

“[The] Tetra app and web platform will create a simple experience for users,” reads the announcement, adding that users won’t need to know about public key cryptography and smart contracts. “This approach will enable a new generation of users to enter the cryptocurrency space and with that bring new investors, new clients for dapps and crypto-based businesses, and in general make a great stride towards mainstream adoption that will enable the positioning of cryptocurrencies as true world-currencies.”

The Tetra platform uses multisig escrow and intends to automate all aspects of the trading process to provide “incredibly secure and worry-free trading” with 2-of-2 and 2-of-3 P2SH multi-signature transactions, smart contracts and encryption of all communications.

Of course, Tetra is hardly the only exchange to focus on easy usability and security, and, in fact similar measures are adopted by many exchanges today. What really seems to differentiate Tetra from many other exchanges is the fact that Tetra is explicitly targeting professional traders and cryptocurrency trading businesses that need to streamline multiple trades, by offering an easy user experience to their customers and presenting themselves as fully compliant with regulations.

""The goal here is to facilitate the growth of fiat to crypto on-ramps and off-ramps, and we do this by encouraging people to operate trading businesses on our platform,"" O'Brien told Bitcoin Magazine.

“The features outlined so far culminate to satisfy business needs; by ensuring customers have a completely secure, legally safe, and easy to use platform Tetra will allow businesses to thrive in an otherwise hostile environment,” concludes the announcement.

The first public release of the Tetra platform and apps, currently available to alpha testers, will support Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Dash. Other cryptocurrencies that support multisig transactions are planned for the future. The platform will begin its roll out in the U.S., Canada and Australia.

To professional traders and businesses, Tetra offers a paid service dubbed Tetra Prime, with support for online and “brick-and-mortar” business storefronts, as well as trade matching and analytics to optimize trading profiles.",REGULATION,0.999
2017/11/17,Blockchain Coalition Seeks to Make Bitcoin Welcome in Wyoming,"A group of people are on a mission to bring Bitcoin back to the state of Wyoming after unfriendly laws made it impossible to transact with cryptocurrencies there more than two years ago.

The Wyoming Blockchain Coalition announced its formation this week. Its volunteer members aim to create a legal and regulatory environment in the state that welcomes cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology companies with open arms.

Among the group’s advisors are Patrick Byrne, CEO of Overstock — Byrne lives in Utah but has been a Bitcoin advocate for years — a former Wyoming governor, and two deans and a computer science department head from the University of Wyoming.

Outdated Laws
Bitcoin used to be welcome in Wyoming. But a 2015 interpretation of the Wyoming Money Transmitters Act (which the state passed in 2003, years before Bitcoin even existed) by the Wyoming Division of Banking made it impractical for cryptocurrency exchanges to operate in the state.

Cryptocurrencies are not specifically included on the list of “permissible investments” within the Act, as stocks or securities would be. As a result, after learning it would have to put up huge financial backing to stay in operation in the state, Coinbase suspended its operations in Wyoming indefinitely in June 2015.   

But a lot of people think the law doesn’t make sense. They see cryptocurrency as the future, and they think Wyoming would benefit from being more progressive.

Caitlin Long is one of those people. Now living in New York, where she serves as chairman and president at smart contracts platform company Symbiont, Long grew up in Laramie, Wyoming.

Over the summer, she wanted to give back to her alma mater. But when she went to personally fund an endowment for female engineers at the University of Wyoming, she found out the school was unable to accept her bitcoin as an appreciated asset.  

Fortunately, Long was able to find a charity outside of Wyoming that could legally liquidate the bitcoin and send it to the university through a donor-advised fund.

“They still got the cash, but it prompted a lot of discussion internally in the university about ‘what just happened here?’” Long told Bitcoin Magazine.

Long would not disclose how much she donated, but typically, donations to an endowment are $50,000 and up.

“When universities have donors that are interested in donating properties, they usually try to find ways to accept the properties,” she said.  

The event prompted a lot of discussion among some of the people within the university and eventually led to the formation of a coalition aimed at educating about and advocating for the adoption of blockchain technology in the state.  

Long offered up her services as an advisor member. “I’m in the business,” she said. “So I volunteered to help with both the bitcoin and the blockchain education efforts.”

No Time to Lose
The coalition is moving quickly. Within a week, the group formed an LLC, sent out a press release stating its goals and launched a website. “This is very, very new, and it is happening in real time,” said Long.

They have good reason to make haste. The new legislative session begins in February. If the coalition wants to push through a bill that will get digital currencies recognized as a “permissible investment” under the Wyoming Money Transmitters Act, they will need to move quickly.

Currently the group is working on legislative language with local attorneys and legislators. Next, they need to educate the citizens of Wyoming and the legislators about the benefits of Bitcoin and blockchain technologies. Some of that will involve webinars and live events, as as well as organizing a dinner in Cheyenne during the legislative session.  

Last year, a similar regulatory effort, Wyoming House Bill 26, did not pass, but that was due to lack of knowledge and some “unrelated political feuds,” Robert Jennings, another one of the group’s advisor members, told Bitcoin Magazine.

This time around, he thinks “blockchain [technology] and cryptocurrency will stand on its own merits.”

Jennings added, “There is already a groundswell of support in the state due to the rise in popularity of Bitcoin.”

But, he cautioned, it will require “an extensive education campaign, which is why we formed the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition.”",REGULATION,0.4588
2017/11/17,Dispelling the Doomsayers: The Future of China's Blockchain Development is Still Bright,"Three months have passed since the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) issued an official statement explicitly defining initial coin offerings (ICOs) as illegal public financing activities. As a result, all China-based ICO projects were required to refund all initial investments, regardless of whether or not project-based tokens were issued; foreign-based projects were required to refund investors as long as the tokens had not been issued; and more importantly, all China-based bitcoin exchanges, including Huobi, OKCoin and BTCC, shut down. The reason given for shutting down: pressure from “related government departments.”

Pessimists believed this would herald the end of Bitcoin in China — and even around the world — a sentiment that has been enhanced by the astonishing plummet of bitcoin price on Chinese exchanges from around $7,400 to as low as $2,400. And, as usual, whenever rumors float out of China, markets react — whether those rumors are based entirely, partially or not at all in truth.

As bitcoin exchanges in China shut down, public trading volumes of Chinese Yuan became literally zero; therefore, any news from China related to Bitcoin should be irrelevant to the price. Bitcoin’s ferocious bounce-back to nearly $8,000 in mid-November 2017, an all-time high, confirmed the point that no matter what is going on in China and regardless of Chinese hurdles, the price of bitcoin will continue its ascent.

But there is an exception: mining.

Will Mining Be Shut Down?
China is still the largest host country for mining facilities. Indeed, 70 percent of hash power globally comes from Chinese mining pools. The miners produced by Chinese company Bitmain dominate the whole industry.

People worry about whether the Chinese government will ban mining, thereby eliminating Bitcoin from China at its source and throwing the ecosystem into disarray. However, this is highly unlikely.

The recent rumor that a mining ban is becoming a reality was derived from a flyer, distributed by a power station in the Chinese province of Sichuan. The flyer stated, “Bitcoin is illegal thus the company shall not provide electricity to mining facilities.”

In fact, this flyer is nothing more than a poorly worded, company-level notice that mistakenly used the word “illegal.” The content, however, has since been misconstrued as proof of an official ban on Bitcoin mining. The financial desk of Caixin — a reputable Chinese news source — and several citizen-based media sources have interviewed the power company in question. These sources have since confirmed that this interpretation is nothing more than overhyped “fake news.” The notice was meant for internal use only. Its chief aim was to warn its affiliates about the risks associated with providing illegal electricity. The power station and its affiliates can generate electricity but have not secured the requisite approval from the government to sell electricity to anyone — not just miners.

It is important to reiterate that China has never denounced Bitcoin as illegal. Bitcoin itself in China is regarded as a type of good. “People have the freedom to participate [in] bitcoin trading as type of goods on the internet,” a PBOC notice stated in 2013. Therefore, the government has no reason to shut down the “factories” producing normal “goods.” While it is true that there are reports circulating that mining facilities are facing the pressure of possible suspension, the reason for this pressure is related to their illegal use of electricity, not mining activities.

More convincingly, Caixin reported on October 13 that “a person close to the regulator said to Caixin that China has no plan to ban mining.”

Lastly, there is a good chance that China could decide to create its own regulated Bitcoin trading market. If these plans become a reality, China is even less likely to ban mining.

There are two reasons why this theory may be valid. First, China is highly motivated to enter the trading market. Japan has licensed several cryptocurrency exchanges, and CME is stepping up efforts to list bitcoin futures to build a more regulated trading market.

China, as the second-largest economy, has good reason to want to build its own regulated market, too. The logic is that as bitcoin trading can’t simply be banned by any single government due to its decentralized nature, banning it will only result in uncontrollable OTC trading that might result in more hidden-capital flight. This is the last thing that the Chinese government will want to see. Therefore, both external pressure and Bitcoin’s internal features will drive China to think about a better mode of regulation.

Second, Caixin also hinted that a more regulated bitcoin market in China might be possible in its article titled “Will Bitcoin Come Back to China After China Becomes Less Relevant to Bitcoin?” The article ends with: “Maybe someday when regulators find a better way to regulate Bitcoin, we can’t preclude the possibility that Bitcoin will come back to China.”

Caixin holds a special status among all media sources for the Chinese Bitcoin industry. It has long been the primary source for regulation and policy signals from the PBOC: It has literally become the mouthpiece for the PBOC in regard to regulating Bitcoin. The fact that this sentiment was allowed to be published under such tightly controlled circumstances makes it particularly interesting and relevant.

Blockchain Development Still Going Strong
The reputation of blockchain technology, which underlies Bitcoin itself, has been stained by the speculation side of bitcoin and alt coins to some extent. But luckily, the development of blockchain technology is still an important directive and priority for China.

According to China’s Premier Li Keqiang last year ― in the government’s 13th Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development ― blockchain technology has been listed as an important area of development for Chinese endeavors. As long as this remains the case in China, we can expect to see overall favorable conditions for accelerated growth in the industry.

Chinese blockchain startups are beginning to expand their communities overseas, and Chinese exchanges have launched international sites. Investors, though less than before and less openly, are still committing to blockchain-based enterprises. Consortium blockchain solutions are being welcomed by big companies. In short, there is more rationality and less speculation.

In fact, the so-called ICO ban is actually just an announcement, rather than a specific law. There is a very subtle balance between the industry and the regulators. The industry is testing governmental and regulatory boundaries as it reaches toward more autonomy. The government, for its part, is observing whether the industry really will live up to its revolutionary promises and is deciding on the best way to encourage innovation while also avoiding speculation risks.

The blockchain industry needs to win regulators’ trust by actually solving commercial pain points to prove that token-oriented models are feasible. If no project can prove this and tokens still remain a tool of pure speculation, the industry simply can’t expect looser policies. It is up to the crypto and blockchain community to live up to its promise and deliver the innovation that the modern world needs and expects.",REGULATION,0.0516
2017/12/1,Regulators Greenlight Bitcoin Futures,"Bitcoin futures contracts to be offered by CME Group Inc. and Cboe Futures Exchange to mainstream investors.

CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, has announced that it has self-certified the initial listing of its Bitcoin futures contract. CME first announced its intentions to launch a Bitcoin futures product on October 31, 2017.

The new contract will be available for trading on the CME Globex electronic trading platform effective on Sunday, December 17, 2017, for a trade date of December 18.

At the same time, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also announced that Cboe Futures Exchange (CFE) has self-certified new contracts for Bitcoin futures products, and that the Cantor Exchange (Cantor) has self-certified a new contract for Bitcoin binary options.

“Bitcoin, a virtual currency, is a commodity unlike any the Commission has dealt with in the past,” said CFTC Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo in a press release. “As a result, we have had extensive discussions with the exchanges regarding the proposed contracts, and CME, CFE and Cantor have agreed to significant enhancements to protect customers and maintain orderly markets.”

The exchanges assured the CFTC that the new products complied with the rules under a process of self-certification. While CFTC approval isn’t required, the regulatory body could have halted the CME’s plans if it wasn’t satisfied with the self-certification.

The press release stated: “Commission staff held rigorous discussions with CME over the course of six weeks, CFE over the course of four months, and had numerous calls with Cantor. CME, CFE and Cantor agreed to significant enhancements to contract design and settlement, and CME to margining, at the request of Commission staff.”

Cboe said they are “operational ready.” Both Cboe and the Cantor Exchange plan to announce a start date soon.

These new derivatives open the doors for institutional investors, as well as introducing the possibility of more cryptocurrencies becoming available in the future. After a record high on Wednesday for bitcoin price of $11,377, there was a 20 percent drop from profit takers down to $9,021; it has since fluctuated several times and is now selling at around $10,500.",REGULATION,0.9623
2017/12/11,Munchee ICO Halted by SEC for Securities Violations,"On December 11, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) issued a cease-and-desist to California-based Munchee Inc. to stop their ICO and return the funds that had been collected.

Munchee had been seeking $15 million in capital to improve their existing mobile app and create a restaurant review ecosystem that they described as being “Yelp meets Instagram” in their Bitcointalk announcement. The problem arose when Munchee emphasized that it would take steps to create a secondary market for the tokens as an investment vehicle, leading investors to have a reasonable belief that their tokens would rise in value, long in advance of the utility of the token being made available.

In the SEC announcement, Stephanie Avakian, co-director of the SEC Enforcement Division, said, “We will continue to scrutinize the market vigilantly for improper offerings that seek to sell securities to the general public without the required registration or exemption. In deciding not to impose a penalty, the Commission recognized that the company stopped the ICO quickly, immediately returned the proceeds before issuing tokens, and cooperated with the investigation.”

In the SEC complaint, the commission argued that the MUN tokens were considered securities because “they were investment contracts” and were deemed a security regardless of their utility at the time of the sale. Munchee consented to the SEC’s order without admitting to, or denying, the findings.

The action is significant as it shows the willingness of the SEC to step in and take action. It also illustrates a willingness on the part of the SEC to work with companies that are cooperative when they run afoul of the regulations.",REGULATION,-0.296
2017/12/14,"South Korea Moves to Regulate Domestic Bitcoin Trading, Exchanges","Since late November 2017, South Korea has looked to regulate cryptocurrency trading in domestic exchanges, including Bithumb, Coinone and Korbit,  The Korea Herald reports. Now, trying to tame the wave of wild cryptocurrency speculation in the country, South Korea is imposing trade bans for minors and looking for ways to impose taxes on investment returns.

South Korea is the world’s third largest market in bitcoin trading, after Japan and the U.S., and the largest exchange market for ether, accounting for more than 33 percent of its market share, according to a recent MIT Technology Review report. The country is also home to two of the top 15 global digital-currency exchanges (Bithumb and Coinone) and believed to have about one million registered daily traders in virtual currencies, which is equivalent to about one out of every 50 citizens.

This is worrying the South Korean government. In September 2017, the country’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) ordered a ban on Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). In November 2017, the head of South Korea’s Financial Supervisory Service said that the agency was monitoring cryptocurrency trading inside the country, and the country’s National Tax Agency revealed that it was considering a value-added tax, a capital gains tax or both on cryptocurrency trades. If the plan is implemented, South Korea will become one of the few countries to tax cryptocurrency-to-cash exchanges.

The government’s concern is also motivated by the risk of cyberattacks from the country’s rogue neighbor, North Korea. According to South Korea’s National Police Agency, North Korean hackers could be targeting South Korean bitcoin exchanges.

With these newest measures, North Korean banks that offer accounts for cryptocurrency trading will have to verify the identification of new account holders and prohibit minors from opening accounts. Woori Bank and Korea Development Bank will shut down virtual accounts offered to cryptocurrency exchanges before year-end, according to the banks.

The regulators will also bar financial institutions from investing in or obtaining cryptocurrencies, and is considering ways to oblige cryptocurrency exchange operators to verify users’ real names, strengthen storage security of encryption keys, and disclose purchase price and order volumes. The authorities will also take strong-handed punitive actions against the perpetrators of cryptocurrency-related scams.

In a press release, the government said that the new regulations were necessary “to prevent a general public without expertise from suffering losses by participating in virtual currency investments that have massive fluctuations.”

These issues were discussed on Wednesday, December 13, 2017, in a meeting presided over by Hong Nam-ki, minister of the Office for Government Policy coordination, and attended by officials from the ministries of justice, finance, and science and ICT, as well as from the Financial Services Commission, the Korea Communications Commission, the Fair Trade Commission and the National Tax Service.

While some news headlines are presenting this as a catastrophic development that will shut down the cryptocurrency industry in South Korea, the initiative of the South Korean authorities is in line with current trends toward stronger cryptocurrency regulations in China, Europe and the U.S.

“A right set of regulations will rather nurture the (virtual currency) market, and we would welcome that,” Bithumb representatives told Reuters, adding that such a code of conduct could add legitimacy to the market.",REGULATION,0.5932
2018/1/5,SEC/NASAA Ring in 2018 by Hinting at Need for (More) Cryptocurrency Regulation,"Yesterday, January 4, 2018, the three prominent figures of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) endorsed the concerns raised in the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA)’s cautionary directive on cryptocurrencies, ICOs, and other “Cryptocurrency-Related Investment Products.” Jay Clayton, the Chair of the SEC; Michael Piwowar, the former acting Chair of the SEC; and Kara Stein, a prominent figure in the SEC and an author of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, joined NASAA, the association that is the voice of state securities agencies in the U.S.,  in urging “Main Street investors” to go beyond the headlines and hype to understand cryptocurrency investment risk.

While this is not the first SEC commentary we have seen on cryptocurrencies, this iteration of caution raises the imminent possibility of the SEC and NASAA intervention into the space, as the SEC-lauded directive showed that 94 percent of state and provincial securities regulators (or roughly 63 of the 67 securities regulators under NASAA) believe there is a “high risk of fraud” involving cryptocurrencies and that all of the securities regulators believe “more regulation is needed for cryptocurrency to provide greater investor protection.” 

Of note: Membership in NASAA not only comprises all 50 state securities regulators in the U.S. but also includes securities regulators in Canada and Mexico (as well as the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. According to Bob Webster, Director of Communications for NASAA, the survey referenced in the directive included NASAA members from the U.S., Mexico and Canada.

The SEC statement by the three most prominent figures in the organization called the NASAA release “a timely and thoughtful reminder,” reminding investors themselves that “when they are offered and sold securities, they are entitled to the benefits of state and federal securities laws.” From a legal standpoint, this comment implies that some or all cryptocurrencies, ICOs and other cryptocurrency-related investment products will be deemed by the SEC as “securities” and that those offering these products may be soon facing accusations of selling unregistered securities in violation of U.S. Securities Laws.

There is a possible point of disparity between the NASAA directive and the coinciding SEC statement: whether cryptocurrencies are “currency.” The usual definition for currency includes the requirements they serve as an accepted medium of exchange and can be a store of value for market participants.

NASAA’s directive states that, “Cryptocurrencies are a medium of exchange that are created and stored electronically in the blockchain, a distributed public database that keeps a permanent record of digital transactions” (emphasis added).

The SEC statement, however, has a slightly different interpretation of the NASAA Directive: that cryptocurrencies “lack many important characteristics of traditional currencies, including sovereign backing and responsibility.” The SEC went further, stating that cryptocurrencies “are now being promoted more as investment opportunities than efficient mediums for exchange.”

This view, unchecked, would allow the SEC to step in to regulate these “investment opportunities.” Whether there was a differing view the SEC wished to convey, or the statement was meant to convey support of the NASAA directive while opening the door for broader SEC intervention into the space, only time will tell.

One final note: FINRA, the non-profit organization authorized by Congress to be regulator in charge in the U.S. for oversight and enforcement actions against broker/dealers on behalf of investor protection, was noticeably silent in joining the SEC and NASAA in issuing a new statement (the previous two warned investors not to fall for cryptocurrency-related stock scams and gave a primer on ICOs).

FINRA Media Relations Specialist, Dylan Menguy, responded to inquiry on FINRA’s view of the statements by the SEC and NASAA by referring Bitcoin Magazine to this press release where FINRA warned investors of cryptocurrency-related stock scams.

NASAA’s Bob Webster clarified the survey inclusion as referenced above in the article, and, when asked about the potential disparity discussed above, stated, “...I don’t see a discrepancy between the two views.  Cryptocurrencies are a medium of exchange and they are being promoted as investment opportunities. For clarification on the SEC’s position, you should contact the SEC.”

2018/1/8,CFTC to Discuss Digital Currency Futures Certification Process,"Five weeks ago, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced three exchanges had self-certified Bitcoin derivatives products. Following the subsequent backlash from the Futures Industry Association (FIA), the CFTC has announced two public committee meetings to review the self-certification process, procedures and operational controls for listing and trading digital currency futures. The news comes on the heels of SEC and NASAA independent statements which discussed the concerns both regulators share on cryptocurrencies, ICOs and other, “Cryptocurrency-related Investment Products.”

The first meeting, slated for January 23, 2018, is the Technology Advisory Committee (TAC) meeting. The topics outlined for discussion include “explor[ing] timely topics and issues involving financial technology in CFTC regulated markets, potentially including blockchain/DLT, data standardization and analytics, algorithmic trading, virtual currencies, cybersecurity, and RegTech.” While the committee meeting will be open to the public and held at the CFTC headquarters in Washington, D.C., a webcast of the meeting will also be available.

The second meeting, slated for January 31, 2018, is with the Market Risk Advisory Committee (MRAC). It, too, is open to the public and will have a webcast for remote viewing. The purpose of this Committee Meeting is to discuss “the statutory and regulatory process for the listing of new and novel products on CFTC-regulated designated contract markets (DCMs) and swap execution facilities (SEFs) through self-certification.”

CFTC Commissioner Rostin Behnam stated:

With the rapid development of financial technology products – including cryptocurrencies – and the corresponding demand for new and novel price discovery and risk management tools, the CFTC is poised to utilize its authority and expertise to ensure that the markets we oversee innovate responsibly within an appropriate oversight framework.
Behnam added, “I believe this is a perfect time for the MRAC to discuss the application of the CFTC's self-certification process in today's quickly evolving, technology driven marketplace.”


It remains to be seen if other regulators view these meetings as an attempt by the CFTC to expand its own authority through amending the self-certification process or if they are happy to follow for the lead role the CFTC is attempting to take in guiding cryptocurrencies toward increased oversight. Regardless, it seems that the CFTC has heard the concerns raised from the FIA, the SEC and NASAA and is planning to act swiftly on them.  ",REGULATION,0.9702
2018/1/9,UBI Blockchain Is the Latest in Series of SEC Cryptocurrency Crackdown Targets,"In a story that is getting all too familiar recently, the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) halted trading on yet another blockchain-related company stock, UBI Blockchain. The SEC explained:

""The Commission temporarily suspended trading in the securities of UBIA because of (i) questions regarding the accuracy of assertions, since at least September 2017, by UBIA in filings with the Commission regarding the company’s business operations; and (ii) concerns about recent, unusual and unexplained market activity in the company’s Class A common stock since at least November 2017.""

Shares in UBI Blockchain traded as high as $115 after selling for just $0.55 less than a year ago; a couple of weeks ago it was trading at around $9. Bloomberg is reporting that UBI Blockchain has just 18 employees, no revenue, $15,406 dollars in cash on hand and $6.3 million in debt. UBI filed with the SEC in September 2017 for a planned sale of 72.3 million shares of stock by its executives, but the phone number listed in the filing has since been disconnected. The share halt started January 8, 2018, and will run through January 22, 2018.

Latest in a Series of Scam Crackdowns
On December 19, 2017, the shares of The Crypto Company were halted by the SEC over concerns of manipulative trading. The shares had surged in price by 2700% in a single month. The halt went through January 3, 2018, which saw the stock drop to $175 from its high of $642. Their 10-Q filing shows cause for concern: The company, which rebranded in July of 2017, had less than $600,000 in revenue, most of which was from trading cryptocurrency. The stock at its highest gave this company with seemingly few people and no product, a market cap of $6.5 billion.

Also in December, the SEC halted both the Munchee ICO and the Plexcoin ICO. Munchee ran afoul of the SEC by emphasizing they were creating a secondary market as an investment vehicle long in advance of the utility of the token being made available. The SEC complaint argued their token was considered a security regardless of their utility at the time of the sale. Munchee consented to the SEC’s order without admitting to or denying the findings and returned the investors’ money.

The SEC took a much heavier hand with Plexcoin, as their new Cyber Unit filed its first charges since being created in September 2017 to focus on misconduct involving distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) and initial coin offerings (ICOs). The scheme involved a recidivist Quebec securities law violator, Dominic Lacroix, and his partner, Sabrina Paradis-Royer.

The SEC obtained an emergency court order to freeze the assets of PlexCorps, Lacroix and Paradis-Royer. Chief of the Cyber Unit, Robert Cohen, said, ""This first Cyber Unit case hits all of the characteristics of a full-fledged cyber scam and is exactly the kind of misconduct the unit will be pursuing. We acted quickly to protect retail investors from this initial coin offering's false promises.""

In September 2017, the SEC had a double hitter with two companies from one person, Maksim Zaslavskiy. He was responsible for REcoin, touted as ""the first ever cryptocurrency backed by real estate,"" and the Diamond Reserve Club. Neither company performed any of the actions that they claimed they would and neither had any of the resources touted. The SEC obtained an emergency court order to freeze the assets of Zaslavskiy and his companies.

Just today, we have news breaking that the CEO of Fantasy Markets, Jonathan Lucas, has allegedly disappeared with investors' money.

The SEC has also issued a statement concerning celebrity endorsements of ICOs out of concern for naive potential investors who may be swayed by big names selling dubious products.

Since the SEC started to pay attention to ICOs last summer, they’ve been taking a pretty understanding stance when dealing with enforcement. Andrew J. Chapin, the CEO of Benjacoin for example, describes how the SEC contacted him about his upcoming ICO in order to discuss what he and his company were planning. He says that he was glad he took the call and learned the “right way” to do things, instead of ignoring it and trying to skirt around the regulations. Thus, in these early days, it appears that the SEC is giving companies an opportunity to make things right, so far, without assessing fines or penalties. But how long that will last is anyone’s guess right now.",REGULATION,0.2732
2018/1/23,South Korea Allows Cryptocurrency Trading for Real-Name Registered Accounts,"Six Korean banks will begin allowing the simultaneous opening of accounts, deposits and withdrawals, as well as transfers of funds between these accounts and exchanges, beginning on January 30, 2018, but with some new restrictions.

South Korea’s government continues its efforts to rein in the trading of virtual currencies such as ether and bitcoin with a new announcement from South Korea’s Financial Services Commission. Investors will now be required to convert their virtual bank accounts to real-name bank accounts in order to continue trading. Deposits and withdrawals are allowed only between real-name bank accounts and matching crypto-exchange accounts within the same bank. The “real name” registration system for cryptocurrency trading will begin by January 30, 2018, with six banks, which include Nonghyup Bank and Shinhan Bank.

Koreans have found cryptocurrencies to be an attractive high-yield investment option; it is estimated that South Korea accounts for 20 percent of bitcoin trades worldwide. The Korean government has been trying to restrict crypto-trading recently, raiding major exchanges and floating ideas such as bans on domestic trading. A statement from the Office for Government Policy Coordination reflected an increased level of frustration with speculative investing in cryptocurrencies: “[We] can’t let this abnormal situation of speculation go on any longer.”

The South Korean government also said this week that it is planning to collect corporate and income taxes at a collective rate of 24.2 percent from local cryptocurrency exchanges this year.

2018/1/25,Indian Government Turns Fiat Currency War on to Cryptocurrencies,"The cryptocurrency marketplace in India is facing a siege from multiple parts of the government as several incidents amount to a buildup of the Narendra Modi–led government’s actions on regulating cryptocurrencies. If the reports out of India are true, the IMF’s “fastest growing country among emerging economies” may have to meet its 7.4 percent GDP growth target in 2018 without the boost that the digital currency industry has provided in the past.

The Prequel: PM Modi Demonetized Rs 500 and Rs 1000 Notes in 2016
Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced in late 2016 a “demonetization policy” in which the Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes would no longer be considered “legal tender” as of November 9, 2016. The reasoning given for the move: curbing the impact of fake currency, “black money,” corruption and terrorism on the nation’s economy.

While the effectiveness of the campaign has been debated and politicized, the same reasoning the prime minister used on fiat currency bills is now being echoed about on the subject of cryptocurrency regulation.

Finance Minister Jaitley to Parliament: Cryptos Not “Legal Tender”
On January 2, 2018, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley answered questions before Indian parliament, in which he stated that “bitcoins or such cryptocurrencies are not legal tender and those indulging in such transactions are doing it at their own risk.”

Aman Kalra, marketing head of New Delhi–based Bitcoin exchange Coinsecure, stated:


If we listen to Mr. Jaitley’s comments carefully, we’ll notice that he never referred to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as illegal, and always mentioned that they are waiting for the report from the group that was formed for this purpose …
Kalra’s point is an oft-repeated one in the industry, that excluding cryptocurrencies as “legal tender” doesn’t necessarily make their trade and usage illegal. However, parliament member Muthuvel Kanimozhi asked the minister during Question Hour if the government would be seeking to regulate cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether given that India “accounts for more than 11 percent” of cryptocurrency trading globally.

While actions to regulate major cryptocurrency coins by Indian heads of state may concern outside investors, given India’s voluminous participation in the markets, Kalra indicated that “not calling it a legal tender doesn’t worry us [Coinsecure] at all. If the [government] had to ban it, they would have done it a long time ago.” Kalra also took the stance that the industry understands it takes time for the government to understand technology like Bitcoin “before coming out with regulations around it.”

Frozen Bank Accounts — Fake News?
On January 21, 2018, news reports from the Times of India indicated that several Indian banks (the State Bank of India, the ICICI, the HDFC Bank and Axis Bank) had frozen bank accounts associated with cryptocurrency trading. Users on Reddit debated the news with one user by the name of ubiquitous_raven, who stated (on reports inclusive of the frozen bank accounts notices):


This is why the nation can never ride the wave towards growth and be early adopters of world-changing tools/tech/ideas ... I believe in the blockchain and its successors and have no intention to scare people out of cryptocurrency. But it is extremely agitating/saddening to watch the largest democracy in the world with the second largest population take steps towards the dark ages.
When asked about the topic, Kalra hinted at two words Americans have tired of hearing: “fake news.” According to Kalra, it appears there is “very little truth” to those news reports. Kalra went on to add, “I cannot comment upon other exchanges in India, but Coinsecure hasn’t been contacted for any such issues from its banking partners.” Some users on the /r/cryptocurrency subreddit agree with Kalra’s statement, noting the reports were either “clickbait” or referencing earlier actions, stating, “This is the explanation of the issue that happened with Zebpay and Koinex one month ago.”

The news, fake or not, has had a negative impact on Indian trading volume for BTC. Conflating the issue even further were rumors and speculation that the banks that were freezing accounts did so to promote their associations with altcoins.

Coinsecure, via Kalra, notes that they have “noticed a significant drop in daily volumes since the beginning of this year.” Kalra speculated that the lack of volume was endemic to all Indian Bitcoin exchanges, stating, “It looks like the users are scared for the safety of their funds after reading such news/reports, and are reluctant to invest before the regulations are out or at least till the time there is a clear message from the government.”

Income Tax Department Sends Notices to Cryptocurrency Market Participants
Another of the main thrusts of the 2016 demonetization efforts seems to have turned toward cryptocurrencies: taxation. While not strictly an Indian issue, the Income Tax Department (IDT) took active measures this week, reportedly sending notices to those who have traded in cryptocurrencies. First reported on Jan 19, 2018, this batch of notices occured after a nationwide survey showed that more than $3.5 billion worth of transactions were conducted during a 17-month period, according to the IDT.*

To Kalra, it appears the IDT’s “only concern is to make sure that every individual who has generated some income though trading of cryptocurrencies [knows they are] liable for taxes.” Whether you agree with Kalra’s optimistic outlook, there is a negative fallout he also notes, namely that “users also get scared after such incidents and stop trading online.”",REGULATION,-0.5994

“Belarus becomes the first state in the world which opens up broad opportunities for the use of the blockchain technology,” said Lukashenko. “We have all opportunities to become a regional center of competence in this field.”

According to the Belarus News Agency, the new ordinance gives “a serious competitive edge” to the country in the creation of a 21st-century digital economy. It provides friendly conditions and simplified regulations for resident companies of the Hi-Tech Park (HTP), a cluster for innovative IT. Belarus promotes the HTP as a special economic zone with a special tax and legal regime.

In particular, Belarus wants to offer comprehensive regulations for business based on blockchain technology, as well as legalize cryptocurrencies, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and smart contracts at the national level. The Digital Economy Development Ordinance is expected to come into force in March 2018, three months after its publication.

“Now, the people of Belarus can list and promote ICOs, create and sell cryptocurrencies, establish cryptocurrency exchanges and do other operations with digital money,” reported RT. Foreign businesses will be able to take advantage of the country’s simplified and permissive regulations by registering a local company. It’s worth noting that many transactions with crypto tokens will not be taxed and will be exempt from VAT until 2023.

According to Reuters, the decree is designed to attract cryptocurrency ventures seeking to escape cryptocurrency and ICO regulations, which are becoming more and more restrictive in the rest of the world. “The decree is a breakthrough for Belarus,” Anton Myakishev, the head of Microsoft’s Belarus office, told Reuters. “It gives the industry the possibility to make a leap forward in its development and allows foreign capital the possibility to come to Belarus and work in comfortable conditions.”

“I am firmly convinced that the effect will be huge,” Mikhail Myasnikovich, chairman of the Council of the Republic of Belarus' National Assembly, noted in a national television interview, adding that Belarus has become the first country in the world to adopt comprehensive business regulations for blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, smart contracts and ICOs.

“As far as I know, we are pioneers in this field,” said Myasnikovich. “No country has ever said with such certainty that it is ready to work towards setting up an analogue of an international financial or currency center. The decree describes every process in detail, namely registration, turnover and taxation.”

“Our country enables a legal environment for using the blockchain,” said IT businessman Viktor Prokopenya. “This technology can be compared with internet development in the 1990s. The web has transformed many professional fields. So will the blockchain.” Prokopenya added that the new ordinance doesn’t go as far as recognizing cryptocurrencies as a means of payment in Belarus, but recognizes cryptocurrency mining as a legitimate business activity.

According to an opinion piece published in The Washington Post, titled “Why would authoritarian Belarus liberalize cryptocurrencies?,” permissive cryptocurrency regulations in Belarus could force Russia to follow suit. Russian Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev acknowledged that heavy cryptocurrency regulation in Russia could encourage the outflow of ICOs from Russia into the neighboring country.

It seems plausible, in fact, that if even a few countries introduce crypto-friendly regulations that allow businesses to do things they couldn’t do at home, the world’s most innovative companies would move to those countries. This could force other countries to adopt crypto-friendly regulations themselves, creating a powerful domino effect.",REGULATION,0.3612
2018/1/31,"SEC Halts AriseBank ICO, Calling It “an Outright Scam”","In a statement from the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), an emergency relief action was filed to shut down AriseBank, which it described as “an outright scam.”

In a growing list of enforcement actions by the SEC, the complaint against AriseBank stated that the Dallas-based company had used deceptive tactics to raise what they claim was $600 million of its $1 billion goal in just two months. Co-founders Jared Rice Sr. and Stanley Ford are being charged with alleged fraud and issuing unregistered securities during its ICO.

On January 18, 2018, AriseBank had announced the purchase of two FDIC insured banks, KFMC Bank Holding Company and TPBG, neither of which exist. AriseBank also offered customers an AriseBank-branded VISA card to spend any of the 700-plus cryptocurrencies using their purported algorithmic trading application that automatically trades in various cryptocurrencies, in addition to allegedly failing to disclose the criminal background of key executives.

Co-director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division, Stephanie Avakian, said, “We allege that AriseBank and its principals sought to raise hundreds of millions from investors by misrepresenting the company as a first-of-its-kind decentralized bank offering its own cryptocurrency to be used for a broad range of customer products and services.”

Avakian continued, “We sought emergency relief to prevent investors from being victimized by what we allege to be an outright scam.”

AriseBank had recently announced it was teaming up with boxing legend Evander Holyfield to help raise money for disaster preparedness. Now, however, a cease-and-desist order has been executed, their office and executives homes have been raided, their assets have been seized, their website is down and their ICO has been stopped.

SEC co-director, Steven Peikin, said, “This is the first time the Commission has sought the appointment of a receiver in connection with an ICO fraud. We will use all of our tools and remedies to protect investors from those who engage in fraudulent conduct in the emerging digital securities marketplace.”",REGULATION,-0.926
2018/2/1,Cryptocurrency Regulation in 2018: Where the World Stands Right Now,"If 2017 was the year of the ICO, it seems as if 2018 is destined to become the year of regulatory reckoning. Things have already begun to heat up as countries around the world grapple with cryptocurrencies and try to determine how they are going to treat them. Some are welcoming, others are cautious. And some countries are downright antagonistic. Here is a brief overview of how 15 countries/unions from various regions are treating cryptocurrency regulations.

United States
The United States, at the time of this writing, has no coherent direction on its cryptocurrency regulation other than that there will be some soon. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has warned investors of cryptocurrency investing risks, halted several ICOs and hinted at the need for greater cryptocurrency regulation.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) became the first U.S. regulator to allow for cryptocurrency derivatives to trade publicly, then organized meetings to talk about possibly changing the rules for cryptocurrency derivatives clearing (one of the meetings was postponed due to the federal government shutdown).

Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin has indicated a preference for minted fiat currency over cryptocurrency. Speaking on January 12, 2018, at the Economic Club in Washington, D.C., Secretary Mnuchin warned those in attendance that he and other regulators were looking into the possibility that cryptocurrency could be used in money-laundering activities. The secretary then announced to the group that the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) had formed a working group to explore the cryptocurrency marketplace and that he hoped to work with the G20 to prevent bitcoin from becoming a digital equivalent of a “Swiss bank account.”

Defending his stance to World Economic Forum attendees on January 25, 2018, Mnuchin explained that his number one focus on cryptocurrency was “to make sure that they're not used for illicit activities.”

On January 26, 2018, U.S. Treasury Deputy Director Sigal Mandelker echoed the secretary’s sentiments after a visit to China, South Korea and Japan. At a press conference in Tokyo, she applauded the three Asian countries for keeping tabs on cryptocurrency trading, stating, “We feel very strongly that we need to have this kind of regulation all over the world.”

It should be noted that non-U.S. investors may have concerns over clearing licensing hurdles put up individually by the states. If the U.S. treats cryptocurrencies as currency, it seems more likely that the actions by the federal government and federal regulatory agencies would preempt states’ licensing. However, if treated as “securities” (the SEC has not completely cleared the issue up), cryptocurrencies, especially ICOs, would have to clear “blue sky laws” on a state-by-state basis.

Canada
The Financial Consumer Agency in Canada does not consider cryptocurrencies to be “legal tender,” excluding all but Canadian bank notes and coins from that definition. The True North, however, is not all harsh on its cryptocurrency regulatory stances. In fact, it appears to be the most transparent country in this list when it comes to understanding laws surrounding the digital currency industry (aside from Switzerland, which wants to be “THE crypto-nation”).

After weeks of hearings, which included testimony from experts like Andreas Antonopoulos, the Canadian Parliament approved Bill C-31 on June 19, 2014, the world’s first national law on digital currencies. The Canadian government has been communicative in its regulatory stances on cryptocurrency ever since: the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) sent out a regulatory notice on August 24, 2017, confirming “the potential applicability of Canadian securities laws to cryptocurrencies and related trading and marketplace operations and to provide market participants with guidance on analyzing these requirements.” If you want a clear and concise interpretation of this notice, check out this article.

More recently, the head of the Central Bank of Canada, Stephen Poloz, was quoted as saying on January 25, 2018, that  “I object to the term cryptocurrencies because they are crypto but they aren’t currencies … they aren’t assets for the most part … I suppose they are securities technically … There is no intrinsic value for something like bitcoin so it's not really an asset one can analyze. It's just essentially speculative or gambling.” It should be noted that as part of the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA), Canada joined an association-wide “cautionary directive” on the risks of cryptocurrencies, with all representatives from every province in the country believing there is a “high risk of fraud.”

Venezuela
Venezuela is not a major world economy or a large portion of the cryptocurrency investing community. The country’s regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies, however,  is noteworthy because the government, under the restrictive regime of Nicolás Maduro, is seeking to skirt economic sanctions imposed on Venezuela by announcing its own oil-backed “petro” cryptocurrency.

Under Maduro, the country has been divided for years by protests and clashes between opposition parties and the government. Venezuela started off 2017 seemingly seeking to crack down on cryptocurrencies as the Venezuelan Bolivar remained relatively unusable. And even as recently as December 13, 2017, the Maduro government sought to regulate cryptocurrency mining as the newly minted superintendent of cryptocurrencies, Carlos Vargas, announced the compilation of a detailed registry of cryptocurrency miners in the country.  

In a country where the fiat currency is worth little and sanctions from the U.S. continue to mount, a state-sanctioned cryptocurrency may cause Venezuela — a typically restrictive regime — to become one of the most progressive countries on cryptocurrency regulations (even if only to further sales of petro).

Japan
Japan isn’t particularly liberal toward digital currency regulation; it’s merely winning the race to attract the best from Asia’s cryptocurrency industry, as China and South Korea have been creating hostile/uncertain environments. Whether or not Japan will allow for a cryptocurrency-themed J-pop band, the Japanese government has certainly been more welcoming of cryptocurrencies than its Asian neighbors.

Recent events may have tempered Japanese enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies, however. The hack of a Japanese exchange on January 26, 2018, resulting in the loss of $530 million worth of NEM coins, has prompted backlash from the community and closer oversight from the Financial Services Agency (FSA).

China
China has been taking ever-increasing actions to clamp down on all things cryptocurrency. Starting off by banning ICOs, China ordered a bank account freeze associated with exchanges, kicked out bitcoin miners, and instituted a nationwide ban on internet and mobile access to all things related to cryptocurrency trading. The People’s Republic of China appears to be the most stringent cryptocurrency regulator of the major economies regarding cryptocurrencies. This is an odd about-face given that, in 2017, Chinese bitcoin miners made up over 50 percent of the worldwide mining population and that cryptocurrency adoption in China increased at a rate higher than any other country.

Though strict, the regulatory actions of the People’s Republic of China, under the stewardship of Xi Jinping, makes contextual sense as the country has recently been focused on stemming capital outflows and stomping out corruption.

South Korea
Where to begin with South Korean regulation? The country boasted a significant cryptocurrency presence in the past and was initially thought of as the country of refuge from the crackdowns occurring in China late last year. However, discord surfaced in January 2018 amongst top Korean officials on future regulatory actions for the digital currency industry, with declarations, clarifications, misinformation and ultimately some limited implementation. The uncertainty and potential negative regulatory impacts have now been cited as the cause for marketwide sell-offs on Red Tuesday as well as on January 30, 2018, when Korean officials began enforcing a January 23, 2018, rule disallowing anonymous accounts from trading cryptocurrencies.

To add external regulatory drama to the political dissonance demonstrated by a government less than a year out from ousting their former president, regulatory prospects for South Koreans have also been hindered by New York State’s Department of Financial Services (DFS), as they reportedly requested customer information on accounts associated with cryptocurrency trading among six commercial Korean banks with branches in New York on January 26, 2018.

Singapore
Until recently, the finance and banking center of Asia has been relatively lax compared to many of its Asian counterparts on cryptocurrency regulation. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), like many financial regulators, warned of risks of speculating in the cryptocurrency markets during the December 2017 peak in bitcoin prices. And Singapore’s International Commercial Court heard a trial that same month over a bitcoin trading dispute, seeming to legitimize the economic stakes in dispute.

On January 9, 2018, Singapore’s Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said that “the country’s laws do not make any distinction between transactions conducted using fiat currency, cryptocurrency or other novel ways of transmitting value.”

MAS fintech chief Sopnendu Mohanty on January 24, 2018 did state that he does not foresee a Lehman Brothers-like financial meltdown with Bitcoin at this point in time, adding that there is “a great indication that regulators are getting serious about this whole cryptocurrency market.”

Mohanty also stated regulators would need to apply consumer protections for digital currencies like bitcoin for it to continue to grow. While there has been no statement yet from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the $530 million hack that attacked Japanese exchange Coincheck on January 26, 2018, targeted Singaporean-based NEM coins.

India
India, once viewed as a burgeoning, friendly environment for cryptocurrencies, has been clamping down on cryptocurrencies in 2018. India’s tough stance stems from similar concerns that other, more stringent regulatory regimes have cited: money laundering, illegal activity proliferation, sponsorship of terrorism, tax evasion, etc. While the cash-reliant country is facing stern regulations, participants of the local cryptocurrency industry do not believe India can “ban” cryptocurrencies through regulations in the same way China has.

Australia
In the wake of the August 2017 financial scandal surrounding the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the Australian government sought to follow in Japan’s footsteps by strengthening its anti-money laundering laws and regulating digital currencies. This differed slightly from the view in 2015 that the Aussie government would seek a “hands-off” approach to cryptocurrencies. Still, the lack of more concise regulation has purportedly had a negative impact on the country as the end of 2017 saw Australian cryptocurrency brokers halt Australian dollar deposits. December 2017 also saw an issuance from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) which hinted at the way potential future regulation could go. The ATO guidance stated:


Transacting with bitcoin is akin to a barter arrangement, with similar tax consequences. Our view is that bitcoin is neither money nor a foreign currency, and the supply of bitcoin is not a financial supply for goods and services tax (GST) purposes. Bitcoin is, however, an asset for capital gains tax (CGT) purposes.
Australia, however, has supporters of digital currencies in government, as August 2017 saw senators from both major parties (Labor and Coalition) stepping forward to call on the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to accept cryptocurrencies as an official form of currency. Therefore, the future of further cryptocurrency regulation remains uncertain but potentially industry-friendly in the land down under.  

United Kingdom/European Union
While Brexit is scheduled to force the U.K. and the European Union to part ways in March 2019, the United Kingdom and the EU remain united in their plans to regulate cryptocurrencies. On December 4, 2017, The Guardian and The Telegraph reported that the U.K. Treasury and the EU both had made plans aimed at ending anonymity for cryptocurrency traders, citing anti-money laundering and tax evasion crackdowns.

The European Union plan would require cryptocurrency platforms to conduct proper due diligence on customers and report any suspicious transactions. Likewise, the Treasury of the United Kingdom stated that they are “working to address concerns about the use of cryptocurrencies by negotiating to bring virtual currency exchange platforms and some wallet providers within anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulation.” The Treasury did, however, add that “there is little current evidence of [cryptocurrencies] being used to launder money, though this risk is expected to grow.”

While one European Union commissioner, Pierre Moscovici, stated in an interview with Bloomberg on December 18, 2017, that the EU was not looking to regulate bitcoin, the commissioner’s statements seemed out of sync with prior and consequential messaging. Two days later, Moscovici’s message was seemingly countermanded by Valdis Dombrovskis, vice president of the European Commission (the Executive for the European Union), when he told reporters in Brussels that:


There are clear risks for investors and consumers associated to price volatility, including the risk of complete loss of investment, operational and security failures, market manipulation and liability gaps.
Calls for greater cryptocurrency regulations echoed across Europe in January 2018. On January 15, 2018, French Minister of the Economy Bruno Le Maire announced the creation of a working group with the purpose of regulating cryptocurrencies. Similarly, Joachim Wuermeling, a board member of the German Bundesbank, called for effective regulation of virtual currencies on a global scale.

On January 22, 2018, Dombrovskis furthered his regulatory agenda for cryptocurrencies by writing three of the EU’s watch dogs warning them of a bubble in bitcoin. On January 25, 2018, embattled U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May joined the fray, echoing the sentiments of International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde and U.S. President Donald Trump. When speaking to Bloomberg during the World Economic Forum at Davos, the prime minister stated, “We should be looking at these very seriously — precisely because of the way they can be used, particularly by criminals.”

While the U.K. and EU have not announced finalized regulations of cryptocurrencies, an expected announcement is likely due in the spring.

Switzerland
Switzerland, known for its progressive attitudes toward individual rights in banking, has kept a similar attitude toward cryptocurrency regulation. The Western European country is conspicuously absent from the European Union and appears to have an open attitude toward the cryptocurrency industry.

Johann Schneider-Ammann, economics minister, told reporters on January 18, 2018, that he wants Switzerland to be “the crypto-nation.” According to an article by the Financial Times, Jörg Gasser, state secretary at the Swiss finance ministry, stated, “We want it [the ICO market] to prosper but without compromising standards or the integrity of our financial markets.”

To that end, on January 18, 2018, the Swiss set up an ICO working group with an aim to “increase legal certainty, maintain the integrity of the financial center and ensure technology-neutral regulation.” The working group will report to the Swiss Federal Council by the end of 2018.

Russia
Russia, like South Korea, can’t seem to decide how it wants to handle cryptocurrency regulations. In September 2017, Russian Federation Central Bank chief Elvira Nabiullina said the central bank was against regulating cryptocurrencies as currency (as a payment for goods and services) and against equating them with a foreign currency. This statement seemed to indicate a progressive hands-off approach was in store for the cryptocurrency industry in Russia.

However, on September 8, 2017, the deputy finance minister for the Russian Federation, Alexei Moiseev, told reporters at a Moscow financial forum that settlements of payments in cryptocurrencies “are not legal now.” The deputy minister continued, stating, “Obviously, now there is a legal vacuum, and accordingly it’s hard for me to say if these actions are legal or not.”

Until these statements, the position proposed by the Russian federation was to allow only “qualified investors” to deal with cryptocurrencies. Russian President Vladimir Putin sided with the position of the Finance Ministry on October 11, 2017, when the president said that the use of cryptocurrencies carries serious risks, being an opportunity for laundering criminal capitals, evading taxes, financing terrorism and spreading fraudulent schemes that would victimize Russian citizens.

The Finance Ministry continued its strict regulatory posturing by suggesting a taxation on cryptocurrency mining ventures on December 28, 2017. The new year began with even more hints at a Russian crackdown on cryptocurrencies, as Putin again sided with the Ministry of Finance on January 11, 2018, when he remarked that legislative regulation of the cryptocurrency market may be needed in the future.

President Putin stated, “This is the prerogative of the Central Bank at present and the Central Bank has sufficient authority so far. However, in broad terms, legislative regulation will be definitely required in the future.” (translation by TASS)

Two weeks later, on January 25, 2018, the Finance Ministry published a draft law “On Digital Financial Assets.” The law, if finalized, would define tokens, establish ICO procedures and determine the legal regime for cryptocurrencies and mining.

Presidential candidate Boris Titov decried the proposed legislation on January 26, 2018, stating that the draft law was excessively strict. According to Titov’s press service, “The Finance Ministry’s proposals present a much tougher regulation than in Japan, Switzerland, Belarus [and] Armenia; that is, in all countries that have adopted some form of legislation. It would be better not to adopt anything than to adopt such legislation.”

Further muddying the waters was a concession by Deputy Minister Moiseev that the December 2017 Belarusian adoption of the “Digital Economy Development Ordinance” could cause capital outflows from Russia to neighboring Belarus if heavy crypto-regulation occurred in the Russian Federation.

Nigeria
Last year saw Africa’s largest economy struggle through a recession that caused a “crunch” to its fiat currency. Bitcoin trading boomed as Nigerians used cryptocurrencies to end-run currency controls restricting access to the dollar put in place to curtail the recession. January 2017 started off with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) seeming to ban cryptocurrencies, only to have CBN Deputy Director Musa Itopa Jimoh walk back the position by stating, the “Central bank cannot control or regulate bitcoin. [the] Central bank cannot control or regulate blockchain. Just the same way no one is going to control or regulate the internet. We don’t own it.” Bitcoin trading boomed by 1500 percent during 2017.

Though the IMF report from December 2017 said the country has exited its recession, tepid GDP growth forecasts and reliance on crude oil exports make calls on January 25, 2018, from CBN Governor Edwin Emefiele to regulate cryptocurrencies seem tenuous. The CBN governor stated, “Cryptocurrency or bitcoin is like a gamble … We cannot, as a central bank, give support to situations where people risk their savings to ‘gamble.’”

Ghana
The governor of the Bank of Ghana, Dr. Ernest Addison, stated on January 22, 2018, that “Bitcoin is not yet legal tender” at a media briefing. While there is a bill before Ghanaian parliament which will allow for the use of cryptocurrencies (seemingly with companies registered as “Electronic Money Issuers” by the government), the current stance of bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) is, according to Graphic Online, one of “six countries that have outlawed [bitcoin].” Addison’s statements come weeks after a recommendation from the Ghanaian investment bank, Group Ndoum, suggested that the Bank of Ghana invest 1 percent of its reserves in bitcoin.

South Africa
South Africa is relatively progressive on the subject of cryptocurrencies compared to others on the list. While the 2014 position paper on virtual currencies issued by the South African Reserve Bank seemed promising for the industry, the South African government began in July of 2017 to work with Bankymoon, a blockchain-based solutions provider, on creating a “balanced” approach to bitcoin regulation.

The country has had valuation issues with its fiat currency, the South African Rand, being devalued several times over the past decade. The 2015 devaluation saw the rand drop 26 percent in response to the Chinese yuan devaluing by a mere 2 percent. Most recently, the country faced devaluation prospects again in March of 2017 as the president fired South Africa’s finance minister. The country has remained relatively mum on cryptocurrency regulation in January 2018, but it will be interesting to see if the reliance South Africa’s fiat currency has on China translates at all to its regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies.",REGULATION,0.9926
2018/2/6,SEC and CFTC Give Testimonies at Senate Hearing on Virtual Currencies,"Today, February 6, 2018, the prospects for coherent U.S. regulation on cryptocurrencies became a little more clear, as were the impasses that were frustrating progress on the issue. The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs (the “Committee”) heard joint testimony from the heads of both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). While both the SEC Chairman Jay Clayton and CFTC Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo provided written testimonies on February 5, 2018, the statements from the chairmen as well as the answers later garnered from Senate questioning gave some clarity as to the direction U.S. regulation of “virtual currencies” is headed. Below is a general overview.

Jay Clayton Loves Blockchains, Lukewarm on Cryptos, Not a Fan of ICOs
In his opening testimony, the SEC chairman called the topic of regulating cryptocurrencies, ICOs and related trading activities important, stating that “these markets are local, national and international.” From a market regulatory perspective, he stated, “For ease of analysis, I break this space into three categories. First, a promising new technology referred to as ‘distributed ledger technology’ or ‘blockchain’ … The second and third categories are cryptocurrencies and ICOs.”

While the chairman lauded and even asked for blockchain technology startups to alleviate inefficiencies in market regulatory frameworks, he was less enthusiastic about both cryptocurrencies and ICOs, stating that they are “subsets of the products seeking to take advantage of the commercial opportunities presented by blockchain.” Cryptocurrencies, according to Clayton, are “promoted to be a replacement for dollars,” while ICOs in his view are “like a stock offering.”

Clayton went on to state that while “those who promote these so-called virtual currencies assert that they will make it easier and cheaper to buy and sell goods, particularly across borders” and “that transaction fees and costs will be eliminated or reduced ... to date these assertions have proved elusive in many areas.”

While some could argue that the chairman’s opening commentary on cryptocurrencies was less than favorable, that impression was far overshadowed by his stance on ICOs. Per Clayton, “From what I have seen, initial coin offerings are securities offerings. They are interesting companies, much like stocks and bonds, under a new label.” He didn’t stop there, however, stating, “You can call it a coin, but if it functions as a security, it is a security.” Another cause of concern for Clayton on the ICO front:


An ICO may have nothing to do with distributed ledger technology beyond the coin itself.
The two problems “worth particular attention,” however, were the lack of regulatory oversight on the markets and that “many” ICOs are being conducted illegally by not following securities laws. Clayton wrapped up his opening volley at ICOs by warning the ICO market that “those who engage in semantic gymnastics or elaborate structuring exercises in an effort to avoid having a coin be a security are squarely within the crosshairs of our enforcement division.”

So much for ease of analysis.

Chairman Giancarlo’s Opening Remarks Add More Hopeful Balance
The CFTC chairman began his opening remarks by revealing a story about how his own children’s interest in investing bloomed only last year with the rise of Bitcoin. Giancarlo remarked, “It strikes me that we owe it to this generation to respect their enthusiasm about virtual currencies with a thoughtful and balanced response, not a dismissive one.” He did urge, however, that regulators “must crack down hard on those who try to abuse [the younger generations’] enthusiasm with fraud and manipulation.”

Chairman Giancarlo’s remarks went on to elucidate the CFTC’s wish for regulators to thoroughly educate themselves and the public in order to create good policy choices and sound regulatory frameworks to protect consumers.

Giancarlo followed up his prudent remarks by saying, “I suggest the right regulatory response to virtual currencies has at least several elements.” Specifying further, he stated that we must first “learn everything we can.” He then suggested that perspective with regard to the market cap of virtual currencies is key, stating that the “total value of all virtual currency in the world is around $313 billion. In comparison, global money supply is around $7.6 trillion, while the value of all the gold in the world is around $8 trillion.”

The next task, according to Giancarlo, is to educate consumers. According to him:


We’ve never conducted this much outreach for any other financial product.
Another element, according to the chair, is regulatory coordination because “no one agency has direct authority over virtual currencies.” He was careful to point out the need for finding a balance between exercising legal authority over virtual currency derivatives while clarifying the CFTC’s statutory limitations. Those limitations, as Giancarlo made abundantly clear, include the CFTC’s lack of authority over regulating the spot markets for cryptocurrencies. He did, however, say that the CFTC has enforcement authority in the spot markets through their authority over the cryptocurrency derivatives markets.

Patchwork Regulation Isn’t Enough
Senator Mike Crapo, the head of the Senate Committee, asked both regulators, “Both of you said you don’t have complete jurisdiction, but do you have sufficient jurisdiction? Should Congress address by law the issue [of regulating virtual currencies]?”

SEC Chairman Clayton posited that all federal banking regulators should come together and have a coordinated plan for dealing with a virtual currency trading market, though he noted that they may at some point in the future find they need additional legislative authority. CFTC Chair Giancarlo concurred but directed the Committee to look at “gaps in the legislation” that could be presented. According to Giancarlo, there is patchwork coverage, but it is not enough to handle a regulatory framework that could be covered by a coordinated effort.

ICOs That Have Raised Funds from U.S. Investors Violated U.S. Securities Laws
The issue of ICOs and their legality was an oft-revisited point during the Q&A portion of the hearing. The minority leader on the Committee, Senator Sherrod Brown, asked Clayton how much of the $4 billion in capital raised last year through ICOs was raised in the United States. The SEC chair couldn’t give any clarity but suggested the number was probably enough that regulators should be talking about the issue. Senator Elizabeth Warren also had her say on the issue, stating, “Some ICOs raise money for legitimate companies, but others, we know, are just Ponzi schemes.”

Senator Warren then referenced Facebook’s recent ban of cryptocurrency and ICO ads and asked SEC Chairman Clayton a series of questions “around” how to make ICOs safer. The senator asked, “In 2017, companies raised more than $4 billion in ICOs. How many of those companies registered with the SEC?” Clayton told Senator Warren that “not one” had registered. Pressing further, the senator asked the chairman how many companies with upcoming ICOs had registered with the SEC, to which Clayton gave the same answer. Unfazed, Senator Warren asked Clayton for a comment on why no one registered an ICO with the SEC. The chairman’s response was a vague admonishment of the “gatekeepers [the SEC] rely on” to assist them in ensuring securities laws are followed, saying they “have not done their jobs.”

Elaborating further, he stated, “What ICOs do is take the disclosure-like benefits of a private placement and then add to it general solicitation and promise to the investor of a secondary market without registering to us.” Senator Warren finished off her line of questioning, saying to Clayton, “I am understanding you to say [that] it [what ICOs do by not registering] is a violation of the law?” The SEC chairman simply answered, “Correct.” But he did moderate his views on the illegality of ICOs by stating, “I’m perfectly happy for these people to do private placements, but do them right.”

Senatorial Enlightenment: Hacks, HODLs and “Kimchi Premiums”
While not all of the questions were focused directly on clarifying future U.S. regulatory frameworks on “virtual currencies,” the cryptocurrency industry was made aware of the effort regulators and lawmakers alike took to learn about the new asset class.

Throughout the hearing, several senators demonstrated an awareness of problems currently plaguing the industry. References to the Coincheck hack in Japan, Mt. Gox and exchange vulnerabilities, and North Korean and Russian state agents’ potential for abusing prices in the cryptocurrency market all came up.

Senator Robert Menendez cited Venezuela’s attempt to circumvent sanctions using Petrocoin, while Senator Jack Reed stressed the need for technologists and computer expert personnel among the regulators to help them understand the burgeoning asset class. Senator David Perdue began a line of questioning about combating pump-and-dump schemes, regulatory arbitrage and financial arbitrage that prompted the CFTC chair to explain what “kimchi premiums” were. Most surprisingly, however, was Chairman Giancarlo’s attempt to define “hodling” to the Committee in the middle of an answer to Senator Mike Rounds about the commodity-like aspects of cryptocurrencies.

Some senators did conflate which countries took recent regulatory actions on virtual currencies, but it is a confusing enough subject that it is the cover story for Bitcoin Magazine this month.

2018/2/6,"SEC Chair’s Written Testimony Hints at Moderation for Cryptocurrencies, but ICOs Be Warned","The written testimony from Jay Clayton, chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), was released on February 5, 2018. It comes ahead of the chairman’s oral testimony before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs on February 6, 2018, on the matter of “Virtual Currencies: The Oversight Role of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.”

Usually the written testimony closely mirrors the language we can expect in the oral testimony today. Going through the written testimony, there are several key takeaways to note. (If the opinions of the chairs contained in this article seem familiar, it’s because they co-authored an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal on January 24, 2018, ostensibly laying the groundwork ahead of their testimony.)

Point #1: IF you seek to raise capital to fund an enterprise via an ICO, the SEC views this as the offer and sale of securities, and your venture is subject to the laws governing the sale of securities.

For those in the cryptocurrency world, this is bad news if the coin you are invested in is determined to be an actual security. On page 3 of his written testimony, Clayton stated:


There should be no misunderstanding about the law. When investors are offered and sold securities — which to date ICOs have largely been — they are entitled to the benefits of state and federal securities laws and sellers and other market participants must follow these laws.
It seems Chairman Clayton believes most ICOs are unregistered securities; meaning, if they are to be considered as such, they’d be in violation of state and federal laws. Clayton further evidences this supposition, noting, “For those who seek to raise capital to fund an enterprise, as many in the ICO space have sought to do, a primary entry into the SEC’s jurisdiction is the offer and sale of securities, as set forth in the Securities Act of 1933.” Here, Clayton is stating that ventures seeking to raise funds via an ICO should consider, as a “primary entry,” registering as a security with the SEC.

At the crux of the chairman’s points here is an argument the industry has faced in a fundamental fashion, especially on ICOs. That argument is, as Clayton puts it on page 6 of his testimony, “Is the coin or token a security?” While Clayton does demur to say that the answer to his ICO question depends on the individual facts of each coin or token, he does state that “to date no ICOs have been registered with the SEC, and the SEC also has not approved for listing and trading any exchange-traded products (such as ETFs) holding cryptocurrencies or other assets related to cryptocurrencies.”  

How Clayton Arrives at That Point:

As a governing definition of securities, Chairman Clayton cited §2(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 as well as §3(a)(10) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. (These two Acts are two of the primary three bodies of law that outline most of the regulations of the U.S. investment industry — the third being the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, or the “40 Act” colloquially.) These sections define a security as “includ[ing], among other items, ‘an investment contract.’” According to federal laws under Title 15 of the U.S. Code, an investment contract is “an investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.” See 15 U.S.C. §§ 77b–77c.

Point #2: The U.S. regulators will apply the same “facts and circumstances” analysis, utilizing a principles-based framework to determine if ICOs and cryptocurrency markets should be classified as securities.

This is a potential sigh of relief for the cryptocurrency industry. If the chairs remain steadfast on this point, it appears that any crackdown on different coins will come in piecemeal fashion and on the merits of the coins individually, rather than from a broad-swept ruling. Referring in his testimony to a report issued on July 25, 2017, on DAO tokens as a test case, the chair seems to suggest the methodology for determining that DAO tokens are securities should be allegorized to other coins or tokens offered in the space.

Going further on page 7 of his testimony, the chair states that “the Commission’s message to issuers [those who conduct the ICO] and market professionals in the space was clear: those who would use distributed ledger technology to raise capital or engage in securities transactions must take appropriate steps to ensure compliance with federal securities laws.”

Point #3: We are doing this in the name of “Investor Protection.”

This is the preemptive Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) propagating line that is being towed about by every regulator safeguarding an economy more prosperous than North Korea’s. However, the point that Chairman Clayton makes on cryptocurrencies is not without merit.

Specific types of investor protection that the new application of the current regulatory framework to cryptocurrencies hopes to improve on include:

improper or nonexistent disclosure (KYC/AML);
volatility (flash-crash-like issues, endemic asset class issues that could cause a marketwide panic among all investable asset classes); and
all of the theft and fraud in the industry.

As the chair puts it in the portion of his written testimony entitled “Enforcement,” there has been a new cyber unit established within the SEC’s Enforcement Division in September of 2017, focused on misconduct involving the industry specifically targeting those types of behaviors listed above.  

Point #4: Cryptocurrencies aren’t “currency,” but some of them aren’t “securities” either.

The chairman doesn’t come out right and directly say this, but on page 5 of his written testimony, he states:


While there are cryptocurrencies that, at least as currently designed, promoted and used, do not appear to be securities, simply calling something a ‘currency’ or a currency-based product does not mean that it is not a security.
The chair does note slightly above in his testimony that “the SEC does not have direct oversight of transactions in currencies or commodities, including currency trading platforms.”

Point #5: But save some prohibition for the average individual investor...

Prohibiting certain classes of investors from participating in a security or marketplace is nothing new. For example, certain private offerings are only allowed to accredited individual investors, while others are reserved for the more specific classes of investor.

As individual investors in the cryptocurrency space (“Retail Investors” or “Main Street Investors”), the following statements in the written testimony are disheartening.

SEC Chair Clayton states on page 2 of his written testimony that his efforts “have been driven by various factors, but most significantly by the concern that too many Main Street investors do not understand all the material facts and risks involved.” While it’s no surprise to investors that cryptocurrencies are currently a volatile and risky asset class, even the hint that Main Street investors lack the understanding of this notion often serves as rationale for restricting non-accredited retail investors from access to more complicated or illiquid financial instruments.

The chair then further stated, “Many trading platforms are even referred to as ‘exchanges.’ I am concerned that this appearance is deceiving.” In Clayton’s view, investors transacting on these exchanges do not receive many of the market protections that they would in traditional investment exchanges. While the chairman could be lauded for his sentiment on protecting investors, especially given that the risks of trading on exchanges have exposed investors to loss in the past, the alternative view of his statement is that the SEC chairman is seeking to find a way to regulate the exchanges that provide Retail Investors access — leaving cryptocurrencies legally accessible only to those sufficiently educated on the risks, the product and the space or, as in the case of accredited investors, allowing only the rich to invest in cryptocurrencies.

2018/2/9,Hong Kong Regulators Send Warnings to Non-Compliant Cryptocurrency Exchanges,"Regulators in Hong Kong have issued a strict warning to exchanges doing business with Chinese customers about trading tokens deemed as securities.

In an announcement today, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said it has sent letters to seven Hong Kong exchanges and firms attempting to fundraise through initial coin offerings (ICOs), warning them about the legalities of selling digital tokens with the characteristics of securities. Most of those receiving the letter confirmed compliance with the SFC's regulatory regime or delisted tokens in question.

The agency said it had been receiving complaints from Chinese citizens about market manipulation on exchanges. Some said they were unable to withdraw funds and reported significant losses due to “technical breakdowns” on exchanges.

""We will continue to police the market and enforce when necessary,"" SFC CEO Ashley Alder said in a statement. ""But we are also urging market professionals to do proper gatekeeping to prevent frauds or dubious fundraising and to assist us in ensuring compliance with the law.""

The agency also cautioned investors about the risks involved in trading cryptocurrencies, including price volatility, theft and fraud, and the difficulty of recovering losses.

""If investors cannot fully understand the risks of cryptocurrencies and ICOs or they are not prepared for a significant loss, they should not invest,"" said Julia Leung, executive director of intermediaries at SFC. ""Investors who store their fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies with unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges should be aware of the risks of hacking and misappropriation of assets.""

The SFC issued two prior warnings to exchanges, one in September and other in December, about selling bitcoin futures.

Today’s statement follows a denial by Hong Kong–based exchange Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, that it had been hacked after it suspended trading on Thursday. The company blamed the suspension on a prolonged system upgrade.

Regulators in Europe and in the U.S. are coming down on fraud in the space. Earlier this week, representatives of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) spoke before the Senate Banking Committee about future cryptocurrency regulations. And recently, several U.S. banks banned customers from using credit cards to buy digital currencies on exchanges.  ",REGULATION,-0.9883
2018/2/9,"China’s Stricter Regulatory Stance on ICOs Signal Caution, Not Calamity","On February 4, 2018, at 10:10 p.m. China Standard Time, Financialnews, a rather small news agency under the administration of China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), released an article that explicitly stated that “China will continue to watch virtual currency and activities related to it closely, and will take actions including shutting down commercial presences and exchanges within China’s territory to uphold China’s financial stability.”

This is the first time that China has sent a regulation signal to the public through an official channel since September 4, 2017, when the PBOC, the China Banking Regulatory Commission, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission and other state-level government agencies in China issued a joint statement announcing that all ICOs should be regarded as “illegal financing activities.”

More importantly, both the Xinhua News Agency (the state media organ) and the news page of the Chinese government website reposted the news, further confirming its authenticity.

The announcement reads:

“Since the joint statement of September 4, China’s regulator still finds that many Chinese have begun to conduct activities regarding cryptocurrency overseas. Considering the risks of trading overseas that Chinese may face, the regulator will take more measures.

“The risks that have been mentioned by the joint statement still exist: illegal ICOs, fraudulent projects or even Ponzi schemes. If investors are considering projects set up overseas, the risks will be even higher since the losses are very difficult to recover.

“According to the source from PBOC, China’s regulator will adopt a series of regulatory measures including banning related commercial presences and shutting down exchanges at home and abroad to prevent financial risks and to safeguard financial stability. No exchange should be an exception. In the meantime, the possibility of introducing further regulatory measures shouldn’t be ruled out.”

However, it’s not yet clear what those further regulatory measures are, as China is still working to figure out the best ways to regulate the cryptocurrency market.

How Can We Interpret China’s Latest Policy Signals?
As Bitcoin Magazine has reported, bitcoin trading or cryptocurrency trading can’t simply be banned by any single government due to its decentralized nature. Banning it will only result in uncontrollable OTC trading that might result in more hidden-capital flight. This is the last thing that the Chinese government will want to see; therefore, the policy should be regarded more as a signal to intimidate bad actors and to remind potential investors of all associated risks, rather than interpreting it as the Chinese government’s final attitude toward blockchain technology and innovation.

The tightening of policy is to be expected, not just because current ICO projects tend to lack the requisite transparency in both project information and the financing phase, or because risks related to the security of assets on exchanges abound. The Chinese regulator has also come under fire lately for its slow response in other cases outside of the blockchain industry. For example, it has been criticized for not clamping down on Ezubao — a fraudulent peer-to-peer lending company that inflicted a great financial loss of $7.6 billion on everyday investors in 2014. 

Most recently, it has failed to tackle the problem of “campus lending” companies that provide college students with seemingly easy access to loans on the condition that they provide nude photos, which the companies later use to threaten the students to pay back the higher-than-normal interest. News of students who commit suicide because they are unable to pay back the money have been surfacing almost every week.

It is likely that China’s regulator will want to move a step ahead before any such extreme cases can occur in the cryptocurrency industry.

And Then There Is Blockchain Technology …
China’s national strategy and local development plans indicate that China still openly supports blockchain technology. (See our article Op Ed: China's ICO Ban Is Characteristic — Not Catastrophic).

It would appear that the government is still observing whether or not the industry really will live up to its revolutionary promises and is deciding on the best way to encourage innovation while also avoiding speculation risks.

In order for the blockchain industry to succeed, it first needs to win regulators’ trust by actually solving commercial pain points to prove that token-oriented models are feasible, especially by using the token-economy business model. If no project can prove this and tokens still remain a tool of pure speculation, or even cause for financial instability, it remains highly unlikely that the Chinese government (or any other government, for that matter) will soften its regulatory stance. 

The onus, therefore, sits squarely on the crypto asset and blockchain community to live up to its promise and deliver the innovation that the modern world needs and expects.",REGULATION,-0.8829
2018/2/9,Japanese Exchange bitFlyer Approved to Operate in Illinois,"Japan's largest Bitcoin and blockchain company, bitFlyer, has now received an official license to operate in the state of Illinois.

After receiving a “BitLicense” to operate as a virtual currency exchange in New York in November 2017, the Tokyo-based company has now received approval to operate in 44 states and territories. On January 22, 2018, bitFlyer announced its expansion into Europe, after being  granted a Payment Institution (PI) license to operate in the European Union. This announcement made bitFlyer the first cryptocurrency exchange to be regulated in Japan, the U.S. and the EU.

“bitFlyer has a culture of compliance and took an aggressive approach in obtaining money transmitter licensure,” Hailey Lennon, bitFlyer's U.S. Director of Compliance, told Bitcoin Magazine. “We successfully launched last November in 42 states and are very excited to add Illinois to that list. Big picture, bitFlyer aims to be a global exchange and allow cross-border trading. This means our various entities’ compliance programs need to reflect evolving regulatory requirements both locally and abroad.""

Chicago, Illinois, is a hotbed of cryptocurrency activity and home of the Chicago Blockchain Center, founded by Matthew Roszak. Furthermore, financial markets company CME Group and Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe), two companies that started bitcoin futures trading in December 2017, are located there.

bitFlyer was founded in 2014 and has raised $36 million in venture capital funding. While it supports only Bitcoin in the U.S. and Europe, it also supports Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic and Monacoin in Japan. In addition to bitFlyer’s work in fintech and blockchain research, the company is working on its own original blockchain, miyabi.",REGULATION,0.4215
2018/2/15,CFTC Advisory Committee Recommends Creation of Virtual Currency Subcommittee,"On Wednesday, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Committee’s (CFTC) Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) held a public meeting at its Washington, D.C., headquarters. During the meeting, members of the Bitcoin and cryptoasset industry shared information regarding this emerging market and offered guidance on how the CFTC may approach regulating the space in 2018.

Multiple participants in the public hearing made comments to differentiate between different types of cryptoassets and their associated technologies.

Potential regulation around cryptoasset exchanges was also discussed as a potential area for further regulation, as has been noted by regulators worldwide over the past few months.

By the end of the portion of the public hearing dedicated to virtual currencies, the TAC voted unanimously to recommend that the CFTC create a subcommittee for this new asset class.

Differentiating Between Different Types of Cryptoassets
One of the key points made by those who were invited to speak about the cryptoasset industry was that all of these tokens or coins should not necessarily be treated equally. For example, during his opening remarks, Coin Center Executive Director Jerry Brito discussed the differences between traditional cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, and initial coin offerings (ICOs).

“Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are commodities, of course, as the SEC has previously [said].  Questions remain however about the borders [around] these categories and about how one can responsibly share tokens to future investors,” noted Brito.

Special Counsel Gary DeWaal of Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP went on to discuss the often-mentioned Howey Test and how it helps determine which types of tokens are securities under U.S. law. In DeWaal’s view, the CFTC could offer assistance in differentiating between commodities and securities in the cryptoasset market.

“Ultimately there has to be some clarification. The distinction between a commodity, the distinction between a security, may seem (from a common sense perspective) clear, but there are very, very important issues around those that I think this committee could very much [help clarify],” said DeWaal.

Notably, DeWaal also pointed out that cryptoassets are “critical” to decentralized ledgers.

“They are the mechanism in proof-of-work blockchains where miners are rewarded: In proof-of-state blockchains where fees are paid, these are the ways you incentivize folks to keep the system together. If you’re only talking about centralized ledgers, sure, you don’t need to worry about coins,” DeWaal added.

Regulation of Cryptoasset Exchanges
RGM Advisors’ chief executive, Richard Gorelick, also made an appearance at the CFTC’s public hearing, and he focused on the market structure of cryptoassets during his brief opening presentation (PDF). Gorelick was one of the only people in the room who referred to the subject at hand in terms of “cryptoassets” rather than “cryptocurrencies” or “virtual currencies.”

One of the key areas of focus for Gorelick during his presentation was the problems associated with current cryptoasset exchanges. More specifically, Gorelick discussed the issues associated with connectivity of liquidity between global exchanges.

“Generally speaking, I think trading on these [exchanges] can be challenging, particularly if your goal is to trade across multiple spot exchanges. It’s difficult to weave liquidity across exchanges and jurisdictions due to a number of factors,” noted Gorelick.

Some of the factors limiting the movement of funds between various exchanges pointed out by Gorelick include:

Technology
Concerns about deceptive trading
Lack of standard best practices
The fickle nature of banking relationships
Capital inefficiency
Security and transparency
The slow speed at which money and assets can move in and out
In the face of these issues found on cryptoasset exchanges, Gorelick hit on the large scale of the over-the-counter (OTC) markets.

Representatives from LedgerX and CME also provided updates on the state of the Bitcoin futures market later in the public hearing.

After gathering information from representatives of the cryptoasset industry and asking questions, the TAC voted unanimously to recommend that the CFTC create a new subcommittee focused on virtual currencies.",REGULATION,0.4588
2018/2/16,Swiss Regulator Gives Clear Guidelines for Launching ICOs,"On February 16, 2018, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA put the world on notice by being the first major economy to set out clear guidelines on initial coin offerings (ICOs). In an announcement, the Swiss regulator addressed plans to apply financial market legislation to different tokens as well as lay out how ICO organizers can get proper input from FINMA when planning or launching their initial coin offerings.



The guidelines, offered as a downloadable PDF, show market participants what information is needed to help the Swiss regulator adequately address all issues presented in inquiries to the regulator, as well as how FINMA intends for current financial market legislation to be applied to ICOs. The published guidelines are intended to complement FINMA Guidance 04/2017, which in September 2017 addressed regulatory treatment of initial coin offerings.  

Important to note is FINMA’s concern over creating transparency. According to the regulator, “Creating transparency at this time is important given the dynamic market and high level of demand.”

FINMA also cited an increase in the number of inquiries corresponding with a sharp increase in the quantity of planned and executed ICOs in the country as a motivating factor for the move.

The regulator’s concern over transparency is clearly illustrated when they state in the guidelines that “ICOs raise a variety of legal issues for which there is no relevant case law and no consistent legal doctrine. Given the wide variety of types of token and ICO set-ups, it is not possible to generalise. Circumstances must be considered holistically in each individual case.”

The press release on the guidelines also provides useful information. The Swiss regulator highlighted that they would focus “on the underlying purpose of the tokens” and that the tokens were “tradeable and transferable.”

The release also showed how FINMA categorizes the tokens into three types — payment tokens, utility tokens and asset tokens (allowing for tokens to possibly take on aspects of more than one group) — and ascribes definitions for organizers to better understand their tokens’ potential assessment.  

Another major emphasis in the press release was on the guidelines’ role in displaying how FINMA will handle ICO inquiries regarding Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and securities regulations compliance. In the release, they referred market participants to the diagram on page 8 of the guidelines (as shown below), which distinguishes the regulator’s stance based on which of the three categories the tokens are put in. While the press release does finish with a note to investors about the risks associated with investing in ICOs, the most important part of the announcement is the portion where FINMA highlights the “innovative potential” of blockchain technology. In it, FINMA CEO Mark Branson stated:


The application of blockchain technology has innovative potential within and far beyond the financial markets. However, blockchain-based projects conducted analogously to regulated activities cannot simply circumvent the tried and tested regulatory framework. Our balanced approach to handling ICO projects and enquiries allows legitimate innovators to navigate the regulatory landscape and so launch their projects in a way consistent with our laws protecting investors and the integrity of the financial system.
While regulations on ICOs are either ambiguously evolving or demonstrating outright hostility in other countries, FINMA has given a clear signal that it wants to provide transparency, open communication and certainty (where possible) to those launching ICO projects within the Swiss Confederation.",REGULATION,0.3818
2018/2/16,"SEC Suspends Trading of 3 Penny Stocks With Tenuous Ties to Cryptocurrency, Blockchain","Today, February 16, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a press release announcing trading suspension of three companies that acquired AAA-rated assets from “a subsidiary of a private equity investor in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, among other things.”

The three companies in question, PDX Partners, Inc., Victura Construction Group, and Cherubim Interests, Inc., had trading of their stocks suspended for 10 days by the SEC under the auspices of public interest and investor protection. Neither the SEC suspension orders, nor any of the announcements by the companies surrounding the acquisitions, however, seem to actually focus on blockchain or cryptocurrencies. The assets that were acquired were trust units (shares) in a management company for a private equity fund that invests in at least 12 disparate sectors, including blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

According to the orders of suspension by the SEC, the companies all set off alarm bells for the regulators when Victura Construction and PDX Partners issued press releases on January 4, 2018, related to the pending share acquisitions. Cherubim Interests issued a press release on January 3, 2018, to the same effect but was also cited by the SEC for its delinquency in filings with the SEC.

All three companies are helmed by CEO Patrick Johnson, former NFL journeyman wide receiver. All three companies are penny stocks with outdated financial information and unaudited or poor bookkeeping. These so-called “penny stocks” are typically a great concern for U.S. regulators as they are often the subject of attempted price manipulation or fraud.

All of the companies announced near the beginning of the year the acquisition of trust units from NVC Fund LLC, the trust manager of  NVC Fund Holding Trust, which commits private equity investments into everything from natural resources and entertainment to blockchain technology and “fintech cryptocurrency.” According to the NVC fund website, the trust manages assets valued at over $128 billion.

Investments made from all three companies were for sums that far outpaced any estimated market cap or gross profit of the companies. PDX Partners announced a purchase of $350 million in trust units, despite only having $29,000 in operating income at the end of 2016 and negative cash flow from operations.

Cherubim Interests announced a purchase of $250 million in trust units, despite having negative operating income and negative cash flow from operations for their 2016 year-end.

Victura Construction announced a purchase of $100 million in trust units, while they too had negative operating income and operating cash flow for the last year they reported financials in 2014. All told, Mr. Johnson’s companies would be taking on $700 million of investments in NVC Funds.

Instead of focusing on the questionable ability of these three companies to afford the price of these trust units, the underlying valuation of the assets themselves, or the fact that the companies all have limited transparency on their websites in public filings, the SEC devotes half of the press release to warning investors about investing in companies pivoting to blockchain or cryptocurrencies.

Michele Wein Layne, Director of the Los Angeles Regional Office, stated, “This is a reminder that investors should give heightened scrutiny to penny stock companies that have switched their focus to the latest business trend, such as cryptocurrency, blockchain technology or initial coin offerings”. It should be noted that the SEC states that Cherubim Interests executed a financing commitment to launch an ICO. This is the only reference in the suspension orders to the idea that any of the three companies dabbled in the cryptocurrency or blockchain space.

Of course, there may be more clarifying information the SEC has yet to disclose in future actions taken regarding the three companies that would clarify how the acquisitions were directed toward the blockchain and cryptocurrency aspects of NVC Fund’s investments. However, no press announcements by the companies seem to have specifically cited the two sectors, and no factors in the SEC suspension orders suggest that the companies were targeting the NVC Fund investments for those particular two categories.

The stated strategic focuses of PDX partners, Victura Construction and Cherubim Interests are: telecom, disaster recovery and restoration construction, and alternative construction projects, respectively.",REGULATION,0.9794
2018/2/20,Wyoming House Unanimously Approves Two Pro-Blockchain Bills,"In a watershed moment for United States blockchain and cryptocurrency law, Wyoming’s House of Representatives unanimously voted “aye” to pass two blockchain bills – HB 70 the “utility token bill” and HB 19 the “bitcoin bill” –  sending them to the State Senate for consideration. HB 70 defines utility tokens as neither traditional money nor securities; HB 19 exempts cryptocurrency from the 2003 Wyoming Money Transmitter Act (passed in the state before Bitcoin’s invention in 2008).

In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Wyoming Blockchain Coalition co-founder, and 22-year Wall Street veteran, Caitlin Long, attributed much of the bills’ successes so far to teamwork between Wyoming banking and security regulators and the efforts of House of Representatives member Tyler Lindholm, who is a co-sponsor and advocate of all five blockchain-related bills.

Wyoming aims to set the standard for blockchain-friendly regulation in the U.S. and to become a hub for blockchain-based innovation with these two bills. Long explained, “There are already bitcoin miners setting up shop because of [Wyoming’s] cheap electricity, no income tax and no franchise tax.”

HB 70: Utility Token Definition
The Wyoming HB 70 defines a utility token, or “open blockchain token,” as neither traditional money nor a security if it meets the following conditions:

The token has not been marketed by the protocol developers as an investment opportunity.
The token is exchangeable for goods or services. (This implies that protocols must offer a working product or service before tokens are issued, similar to Switzerland’s recent ICO framework.)
The protocol developer has not entered into a repurchase agreement of any kind or entered into an agreement to locate buyers for the token.
Similarly, people who facilitate the exchange of an “open blockchain token” are not deemed traditional broker-dealers of securities.

HB 19: Cryptocurrency Exemption
HB 19 exempts cryptocurrency from the Wyoming Money Transmitter Act. A 2015 interpretation of this act by the Wyoming Division of Banking made it impractical for cryptocurrency exchanges to operate in the state. As a result, Coinbase suspended operations in Wyoming indefinitely in June 2015.

The passage of HB 19 moves Wyoming one step closer to cryptocurrency-friendly exchange regulation. Should the bill receive a majority vote in the Senate, exchanges such as Coinbase could resume operation in Wyoming.

Other Bills in the Pipeline
The Wyoming House of Representatives is also reviewing bills HB 101 and HB 126 in the House and SF 111 in the Senate.

HB 101, the “blockchain filings bill,” promises to update Wyoming’s Business Corporations Act to authorize the creation and use of blockchains to store records, the use of a network address to identify a corporation's shareholder and the acceptance of shareholder votes signed by network signatures.

At a high level, HB 101 specifies requirements for all corporations using electronic network or (blockchain) databases. HB 101 has passed the first reading in the House.

HB 126, the “series LLC bill” allows for the creation of “series LLCs.” This type of LLC structure is favorable towards decentralized protocols, as it enables LLCs to establish a compartmentalized series of members/managers, transferable interests or assets, and distributions to members.

HB 126 has also passed the first reading in the House.

SF 111, the “crypto property tax exemption bill,” has already been approved in the House, and its goal is to exempt cryptocurrency from Wyoming state property taxes. The bill is now awaiting consideration in the Senate.

Nothing Is Carved in Stone
While HB 70 and HB 19 have both passed in the House by a vote of 60–0, they must also pass in the Senate to be recognized as official acts.

Long expressed her optimism, while acknowledging the difficulties that lie ahead:

I don’t want to sugar-coat that it won’t be difficult. The Senate is a more uncertain chamber. But, we have incredible momentum, and all we need [for the bills to become acts] is a majority vote in the Senate.
Should the bill pass in the Senate and become an act in Wyoming, federal regulation and the SEC Howey Test could still nullify all of the advocates’ blood, sweat and tears. However, Long believes that Federal Law with regards to utility hasn’t been established yet — and, that there are people in the blockchain/cryptocurrency industry “flush with cash, interested in litigating this issue.”

Long and other Wyoming blockchain proponents hope for a final Senate outcome on HB 70, the “utility token bill,” and HB 19, the “Bitcoin bill,” as early as the middle next week.",REGULATION,0.4019
2018/2/21,Korean Regulator Tips Cryptocurrency Prospects Back Toward “Normalization”,"On February 20, 2018, investors saw signs of yet another directional shift in South Korea’s regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies. According to Reuters, Choe Heung-sik, the governor of South Korea’s Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), told reporters, “The whole world is now framing the outline (for cryptocurrency) and therefore (the government) should rather work more on normalization than increasing regulation.”

The head of the FSS has wrestled with cryptocurrency regulation and the lack of legislation on the industry for some time. He stated in November 2017 that “supervision [of cryptocurrency exchanges] will come only after the legal recognition of digital tokens as legitimate currency.”

Choe also warned of a bitcoin bubble in December 2017 that paired with another warning that month, when he stated, “All we can do is to warn people as we don’t see virtual currencies as actual types of currency, meaning that we cannot step up regulation for now.”

The FSS, which has been spearheading the government’s regulation of cryptocurrency trading as part of a larger task force, has had an uphill battle in the face of Korean officials’ variable attitudes to the burgeoning industry. While the FSS-led taskforce set the nation’s first official rules around cryptocurrency trading on December 13, 2017, uncertainty around issues of taxation and regulation of the exchanges remained.

January brought even less certainty to the peninsula as South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges were raided by police and tax agencies on January 10, 2018, kicking off a week of contradiction by top Korean officials that precipitated a market-wide meltdown known as “Red Tuesday” on January 16, 2018.

Choe then had to state at a parliamentary hearing on January 19, 2018, that one FSS employee was being investigated “on suspicion that he or she traded a digital currency” ahead of the government’s announcement of toughening its stance on cryptocurrency trading. At the same hearing, the Office for Government Policy Coordination also disclosed a probe into two officials for alleged profiteering on government information after the events of Red Tuesday.

Korean officials rounded off the month of January by announcing on January 23, 2018, that anonymous accounts would be banned from trading cryptocurrencies as of January 30, 2018.

Merely three weeks after the ban on anonymous accounts took effect, Choe seemed to suggest rosier regulatory prospects for the cryptocurrency industry. These statements of normalization came only days after the sudden death of Jung Ki-joon on February 18, 2018. Jung, a 52-year-old man who led economic policy for the Office for Government Policy Coordination and was instrumental in spearheading the January crackdown, died of “unknown” causes in his home, though initial reports suggested that he’d had a heart attack.",REGULATION,-0.9788
2018/2/22,Venezuela’s On-and-Off Love Affair With Cryptocurrency Mining: It’s Complicated,"If you want to see first hand how cryptocurrency functions in a market outside of speculative investing, right now, Venezuela is an interesting place to look.

“Venezuela could become a case study repeated all over the world under certain conditions,” said Jeffrey A. Tucker, editorial director of the American Institute for Economic Research (AIER), in correspondence with Bitcoin Magazine. “Crypto is there as the escape hatch, the way out, a tool of emancipation. If you have a power source, you can mine. If you need to save or trade or move your wealth, crypto is there for you.”

Crisis-Catalyzed Currency
Venezuela has been in economic recession for more than a decade. As a result, the government has maintained strict control over its currency, the Venezuelan bolivar (VEF), since 2003.

Venezuela’s most abundant resource is oil. It is the fifth largest oil exporting country in the world, with the largest reserves of non-conventional oil (extra-heavy crude) in the world. Ultimately, it is oil which has catalyzed Venezuela’s cryptocurrency boom.

Falling oil prices since 2014 have spurred the country’s current economic depression. The government’s response has been to increase state control over the economy at the expense of the private sector. In 2017, inflation of the Venezuelan bolivar (VEF) exceeded 650 percent. As the exchange rate continued to tumble, the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) contracted 12 percent by the end of 2017.

“Many people are leaving Venezuela. The country doesn’t have enough money to provide food, medicine and other necessities for its people,” a Venezuelan programmer aware of cryptocurrency mining procedures in Venezuela told Bitcoin Magazine in an interview, under condition of anonymity.

Power to Mine
In this economically desperate climate, cryptocurrency has found one of its most sustaining use cases as an immutable store of value and currency for individuals who cannot trust their own government. The last two years have seen an enormous spike in cryptocurrency earning and mining, most notably for bitcoin.

Because the Venezuelan government subsidizes electricity past the point of negligibility, the country has become a geopolitical hotspot for mining. Antminer S9s are the most popular computer used to mine bitcoin in Venezuela. They cost about $3,000 each (plus shipping) and usually come from China by way of a covert middle country.

According to our source’s approximation, “Having three S9 miners is about 30 cents a month to pay for electricity. Three devices would be one bitcoin-ish in 10 months.”  The beginning price for mining has made it an effective way to supplement income, with two to three devices per household, though many have scaled their operations to the point where they are able to independently support themselves.

“There must be tens of thousands of people mining in Venezuela,” said Randy Brito, founder of the non-profit website BitcoinVenezuela.com. “People that are earning cryptos, either mining or working, usually use them to buy abroad — they buy food, medicine, car parts, other machinery parts; but the most common thing people buy are foreign currencies in other platforms where they can load cards that they can use to buy on Amazon and other stores that only accept cards and not cryptos directly.”

In Venezuela, bitcoin is the most commonly mined cryptocurrency because it was the first, and it is still currently the most widely used. LocalBitcoins has also given bitcoin the advantage in Venezuela because it does not trade other cryptocurrencies; it is able to operate more safely than other local exchanges because it’s not based within the country.

However, Brito also admitted that Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash and Bitcoin Cash as well as other altcoins are being used more and more often.

According to our anonymous source, there are two main problems with mining cryptocurrency in Venezuela: In a country where the national currency has essentially no value, people are willing to get currency with value at the cost of committing violent crimes; and the government is not on your side.

2017: A Year of Contradiction
2017 was a particularly confusing and uneasy time to mine cryptocurrency in Venezuela. The year began with a government authority crackdown on large scale cryptocurrency mining operations.

Miners were jailed for a laundry list of crimes: ""the legitimacy of capital, illicit enrichment, computer crimes, financing of terrorism, exchange fraud and damage to the national electricity system.""

By October 2017, authorities were even cracking down on small “household” mining operations. The congruity in all of these raids is that arrested miners could almost always get out of jail through bribes or fines, but they could never get their equipment back.

Brito doesn’t live in Venezuela anymore, but, as a self-described “anarchocapitalist” and libertarian, he is still very critical of its government.

Most of the big mining farms with thousands of ASICs or rigs are run by people close to the government, those that are not and are caught with several devices, end up being raided and the devices subtracted. Regular people buy the devices with foreign currency they have saved or they acquire in the free (black) market, or buy them from others that import them using bolivars inside the country.
“Defaulted-Promise” Coins
On December 3, 2017, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced that the Venezuelan government would create its own official cryptocurrency called the Petro. He then went on to highlight the benefits of cryptocurrency mining, introducing a representative from the newly formed National Association of Cryptocurrency Miners.

Less than two weeks later, however, police raids on cryptocurrency mining operations proceeded as though it were still as illegal as ever.

“We are building the Blockchain Observatory for the possibility of a registry for all those who are exercising digital mining in Venezuela. We want to know who they are, we want to know where they are, we want to know what equipment they are using. We want to move toward the regularization of digital mining in Venezuela,” announced the recently appointed superintendent of cryptocurrency, Carlos Vargas, in December 2017.

In January 2018, the Venezuelan government opened online registration for those interested in mining cryptocurrency legally. While Petro is clearly the main focus, authorities have said that those involved in the program can mine other cryptocurrencies so long as they are approved by the state.

There is very limited third-party confidence in the Petro’s success. While some cryptocurrency champions might say, “Wait, a decentralized token representing a finite oil supply could be very interesting, if done right,” most remain skeptical.

“It [Petro] is backed by nothing but the promise of a government that have already defaulted,” said Brito.",REGULATION,0.6369
2018/2/22,Government of Spain Considers Blockchain-Friendly Regulations,"The government of Spain is preparing blockchain-friendly legislation including possible tax breaks to attract companies in the emerging blockchain technology sector, Bloomberg Politics reports.

“We hope to get the legislation ready this year,” said MP Teodoro Garcia Egea, who is preparing a comprehensive cryptocurrency-related bill. “We want to set up Europe’s safest framework to invest in ICOs.”

Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and token sales are one of the latest blockchain-related hot trends and have permitted several companies to raise tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars in a short space of time, bypassing the need for prior regulatory approval.

ICOs can be very appealing to speculators because the value of a successful token can rise spectacularly, but regulatory agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the U.S., are beginning to clamp down on token sales, claiming that crypto-tokens are equivalent to company shares traded on the stock market. According to the SEC, some ICOs are essentially Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), and should be subject to similar regulations for the protection of investors.

At the same time, too much regulation could stifle innovation and push promising blockchain-based firms to relocate to less restrictive jurisdictions offshore. According to Garcia Egea and the Popular Party, the ruling political party of Spain to which the lawmaker belongs, it’s in Spain’s interest to attract and keep those firms, and, therefore, the country should adopt a blockchain-friendly regulatory approach.

Garcia Egea added that the bill in preparation was inspired by existing blockchain-friendly regulatory frameworks such as those that enable the Crypto Valley in Switzerland. It could include ways to attract investment in blockchain technologies, such as a threshold below which a cryptocurrency investment wouldn’t need to be reported to the regulator, and specific regulations to make it attractive for entrepreneurs to use a blockchain to carry out initial coin offerings, or ICOs, as a financing tool.

As shown by a series of recent posts (in Spanish) published in his personal website, Garcia Egea wants to introduce a whole range of emerging technologies in the Spanish economy, including digital administration, cybersecurity, 3D printing and blockchain technology.

For example, Garcia Egea supports the Alastria consortium focused on the establishment of a semi-public, permissioned national blockchain infrastructure and digital identity system.

“Smart contracts, ensuring the traceability and unchangeability of specific information, raising funds through ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings), etc. is possible through this new network [Alastria],” said Garcia Egea (translated by this writer).

“The time has come to establish a legal framework for individuals and firms to execute [smart-contract based] financial transactions in a protected and secure way, using the best available technology,” added Garcia Egea. “This will not only provide legal security to financial investments done through this channel, but it will also place Spain in a privileged position to attract capital, talent and future-oriented projects, and an ecosystem upon which to build the future of the internet of value.”

It seems likely that, if Garcia Egea and the Popular Party manage to convert their vision into law, Spain could become one of the few crypto-havens in the Eurozone, which could result in many innovative technology developers and ICO operators relocating to Spain.",REGULATION,0.9986
2018/2/26,European Commission Urges Nations to Embrace Blockchain Tech but Address Risks,"Following remarks made by Valdis Dombrovskis, vice president of the European Commission (EC), after a roundtable on cryptocurrencies, it appears that the European Union (EU) is prepared to take steps toward regulating cryptocurrencies.

While acknowledging that European nations should embrace blockchain technology in order to remain competitive in financial markets, Dombrovskis also cautioned that they should be taking steps to protect their citizens from hazards in the cryptocurrency space.

“Based on the assessment of risks and opportunities and the suitability of the existing regulatory framework for these instruments [cryptocurrencies and ICOs], the Commission will determine if regulatory action at EU level is required.”

The EC roundtable focused on three specific topics:

Implications of cryptocurrencies for financial markets
Risks and opportunities associated with their use
The recent development of initial coin offerings (ICOs)
Just last month, the EC launched the EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum to consolidate and grow blockchain initiatives within the EU. Over the last couple of months, there have been warnings from EU member states about the potential bitcoin bubble, while conflicting statements about both regulating and not regulating cryptocurrencies have come from those same member states. Today’s announcement from the roundtable seeks to unify a message to feed into their upcoming Action Plan on FinTech and the EU’s position for a possible discussion with the G20. There were five major conclusions that came out of the session.

The first point is that blockchain technology holds a strong promise for financial markets; to remain competitive, the EU must embrace the technology.

Second, cryptocurrencies, which they deemed “not currencies in the traditional sense,” have become the subject of significant speculation, exposing consumers and investors to substantial risk of losing their investment.

This second point leads to the third, which is that warnings about the aforementioned risks to consumers and investors are vital and must be clearly and frequently stated across all jurisdictions.

Fourth, ICOs have become a creative method for companies to raise funding, but this opportunity also comes with high risk to investors due to lack of transparency regarding the issuers’ identities and underlying business plans.

Finally, the EC needs to assess under what circumstances the existing regulation covers cryptocurrencies and related services. This will vary greatly depending on the circumstances around specific crypto-tokens, and the EC will determine if any regulatory action is required at the EU level.

The EC proposes that any virtual currency exchanges or wallet providers be subject to the Anti-Money Laundering Directive. The Commission also suggests that its member states prepare for rapid transposition of this legislation while the EC continues to monitor the markets for changes that might impact their plans.",REGULATION,-0.25
2018/3/1,SEC Sends Wave of Subpoenas to ICOs,"On February 28, 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported that the SEC decided to cap off the month the way the top U.S. financial regulator started it: targeting ICOs. On Wednesday, the Journal report stated that “scores” of subpoenas and information requests were sent out demanding details about the structure of sales and pre-sales of ICOs. While the article specifically mentions that the SEC has declined to comment and cites nebulous anonymous sources, the probes reportedly sought the subpoenas and requests from tech companies and advisers involved in the digital tokens market.

The SEC has been outright proclaiming its stance on ICOs as unregistered securities for a while now. In July 2017, a report came out concluding an investigation on DAO tokens, labeling the digital assets as securities. The U.S. regulator has hinted, not so subtly, at taking more action against ICOs generally. Prior to this year, however, actions taken against ICOs, like the shuttering of the Munchee’s ICO or the halting of AriseBank, have usually been linked to the idea that these ICOs were scams meant to defraud investors.

The tenor of the SEC’s stance on the broader ICO market appears to have changed, from hinting that the regulator views ICOs as unregistered securities in violation of U.S. Securities laws to outright warning ICOs of an oncoming crackdown in written and oral testimony. That testimony was delivered by SEC Chair Jay Clayton on February 6, 2018, before a Senate Committee hearing. During his testimony, the Chair noted, “From what I have seen, initial coin offerings are securities offerings. They are interesting companies, much like stocks and bonds, under a new label. You can call it a coin, but if it functions as a security, it is a security.”

Also of particular note to the ICO industry was an exchange during the same hearing that the SEC Chair had with Senator Elizabeth Warren, where Clayton noted that no ICOs had been registered as securities with the SEC prior to the hearing and no planned ICOs had sought registration as securities.

Overstock’s tZERO
Some ICOs, such as Overstock’s tZERO, have purportedly planned to file a private placement memorandum (PPM) with the SEC. PPMs allow for direct sales of securities to investors and are usually marketed to accredited investors. Overstock announced its release of a restated version of the PPM, initially dated December 18, 2017, in an 8K filing this morning.

According to the document, “In February 2018, the Division of Enforcement of the SEC informed [tZERO] that it is conducting an investigation in the matter Re: Overstock.com, Inc. (NY-9777) and requested that the Company voluntarily provide certain documents related to the [PPM] and the Tokens in connection with its investigation. The Company is in the process of responding to this document request and will cooperate with the SEC in connection with its investigation.”

The PPM further states, “While the SEC is trying to determine whether there have been any violations of the federal securities laws, the investigation does not mean that the SEC has concluded that anyone has violated the law.”

The PPM also cites that both of the broker-dealer subsidiaries (Pro Securities and SpeedRoute) connected to the ICO are being investigated by regulators. Pro Securities was notified on February 22, 2018, that the SEC is conducting an examination on their practices and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has issued several document requests with SpeedRoute, dating back to December 2017.

While some in the industry may argue this is more FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) speculation from the media, the SEC appears to be making good on its prior warnings. And Overstock’s disclosures in its filing with the SEC show at least one case where the warnings are being acted upon.  ",REGULATION,0.2536
2018/3/6,Wyoming Blockchain Bill Rockets Ahead for Signing,"In a landmark development for blockchain advancement, Wyoming’s state legislature has cleared what is known as House Bill 70 (HB 70), which exempts various types of crypto assets from securities laws. The bill was originally passed by Wyoming’s House of Representatives last month on February 20. It is now headed to Governor Matt Mead for signature.

According to public records, it passed by a vote of 27–3, with no senators abstaining. This final vote, which was expected to occur last week, was held up at the last minute for further discussion. Nevertheless, lawmakers completed work on legislation to exempt cryptocurrencies from state money transmission laws. They also approved the use of blockchain-based records for corporations.

Through this legislation, lawmakers hope to carve-out space for tech developers involved in the creation of what are known as “utility tokens.” The exemption would be directed at those utility tokens which are not marketed or promoted as investments and are able to be exchanged for goods and services.

The first of its kind, HB 70 provides legal guidelines on how certain types of cryptographic tokens are accounted for. And in a similar development, HB 19, a Bitcoin-friendly bill, is also steadily making its way through the Wyoming legislature. Also unanimously passed in the House, it exempts cryptocurrencies from the state’s money transmission laws.

Wyoming’s History of Setting Precedence
Wyoming is a state known for its rugged individualism with the desire to achieve “first mover advantage” in key areas of legislation. It is often dubbed the “Equality State”: the first state to grant women voting rights and the first state to elect a female governor.

With respect to business and commerce, it originated the Limited Liability Company (“LLC”) in 1977. Today, nearly two-thirds of businesses formed throughout the U.S. choose the LLC corporate entity format. LLCs formed in the state of Wyoming are on par with better-known Nevada and Delaware corporations in offering stellar asset protection.

A Wyoming native and former Wall Streeter, Caitlin Long, the co-founder of the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition and former chairman and president of enterprise blockchain company Symbiont, has been an enthusiastic champion of this blockchain legislation.

Long said in an email response to Bitcoin Magazine: “HB 70 is one of five blockchain bills supported by the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition, and four are already in the Governor’s inbox (the fifth is likely to pass tomorrow). The Governor has three days to sign the bills, and most of them take effect immediately after he signs. All five are designed to attract software companies to move to Wyoming, as well as to attract businesses to register in Wyoming even if they don’t move there.”

According to Long, HB 70, coined the ""utility token bill,"" represents the first time in the world that an elected body has recognized utility tokens as a distinct asset class that is neither a security nor money. She said that while the bill gives the industry a friendly state in which to base operations, it does not resolve the federal regulatory questions for utility token issuers. Regardless, she said, it can help set precedence in litigation and influence federal policy.

Long said that two of the other five bills are designed to be cryptocurrency-friendly, exempting cryptocurrencies from both Wyoming’s money transmitter laws and property taxes. Wyoming, she explained, already has zero income taxes or franchise taxes, so these bills are quite friendly to crypto businesses and crypto owners who want to move to the state.


Finally, she pointed to the last two bills aimed at attracting more businesses to register in Wyoming, which ranks third behind Delaware and Nevada in the number of new business registrations. She concluded: “The race is on to see which state, Wyoming or Delaware, will be the first to accept registrations in blockchain form. Game on, Delaware!”",REGULATION,0.9936
2018/3/8,"Japan Toughens Oversight, Penalizes Cryptocurrency Exchanges","In its most sweeping crackdown yet, a Japanese regulator has penalized seven cryptocurrency exchanges, requiring two to halt operations for one month.

Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) announced today, March 8, 2018, that it came down on the exchanges due to their failure to provide proper internal-control systems. All of the exchanges were ordered to step up efforts to improve security and prevent money laundering.

Business suspension orders were issued for FSHO and Bit Station, effective today. The FSA said FSHO was not properly monitoring trades and employees at the exchange had not undergone proper training. The FSA also alleged that a senior employee at Bit Station had used customers’ bitcoin for personal use.

The five other exchanges punished were GMO Coin, Tech Bureau, Mister Exchange, Increments and Coincheck. Coincheck was served with its second business improvement order since its security breach earlier this year, when $530 million worth of NEM (XEM) tokens were stolen.

Coincheck to Repay Victims
In a news conference today, Coincheck also announced that it will begin compensating users who had their cryptocurrency stolen, beginning as soon as next week. The exchange was hacked on January 26, 2018, after a hacker used malware to gain access to an employee’s computer.

All of the 260,000 users impacted by the theft will be paid back in Japanese yen, based on NEM rates at the time of the theft, the Tokyo-based company said.

At the root of the problem, the cryptocurrency exchange had been keeping all its NEM in a hot wallet connected to the internet. In contrast, at any one time, U.S.-based exchange Coinbase keeps 98 percent of its funds in a more secure cold wallet. The vice president of the NEM Foundation, Jeff McDonald, also told Bitcoin Magazine that if Coincheck had been using a multisignature wallet, the problem would not have occurred.  

It is still not clear who was behind the Coincheck hack.

Tough Measures
The Coincheck hack was one of the largest thefts of cryptocurrency in the world since Mt. Gox, another Tokyo exchange, was brought to its knees by hackers in 2014. What happened at Coincheck highlighted the risks of storing funds in cryptocurrency exchanges, and since then, Japan’s FSA has taken strong measures to protect its citizens and ensure the security of cryptocurrency exchanges across the country.

Following the Coincheck breach, Japanese authorities announced on January 29, 2018, that they would investigate all cryptocurrency exchanges in the country for security gaps, and ordered Coincheck to, essentially, get its act together.

The FSA gave Coincheck until February 13, 2018, to submit a report summarizing the actions it would take to improve security and customer support.

Last year, Japan became one of the first countries to regulate cryptocurrency exchanges when it set up a licensing system. Some 16 exchanges in the country are currently registered, while another 16, including Coincheck, have been allowed to continue operating unregistered while they apply for licences. Five of the seven exchanges punished by the FSA are unregistered, including the two forced to suspend business. Subsequent to its business suspension, Bit Station withdrew its application for a license.

Japan’s crackdown on exchanges follows a series of efforts by U.S. regulators to tighten reins on the industry. Yesterday, the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) proclaimed that anyone selling initial coin offering (ICO) tokens are unregistered money transmitters, while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) warned that any exchange selling tokens deemed as securities must register with the agency.    

Overall, Japan remains one of the more cryptocurrency-friendly countries, distinguishing itself from crackdowns in South Korea and China.",REGULATION,-0.0516
2018/3/12,Dutch Finance Minister Advises Government on Cryptocurrency,"In a six-page letter to the Dutch senate and house, Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra has outlined his concerns over the rapid and dramatic growth in cryptocurrencies.

Hoekstra emphasized that there has been little time to understand and react to the changing landscape and that the current supervision and regulatory framework is ill equipped to deal with it. Because of the cross-border nature of the technology and markets, closing those gaps requires a unified approach across governments and borders. The minister will actively be working in a European context, but the entire process will take time and coordination between disparate governments and agencies.

Like most other policy makers, Hoekstra sees the value in promoting and developing the technology behind cryptocurrency, such as cryptography and distributed ledger technology. However, in addition to the concern over fraud and hacking, the minister also expressed concern over the immature and unregulated nature of the market and how to better inform consumers of the potential risks.

Hoekstra described the following as starting points in his assessment of possible policies and regulations to control the risks associated with cryptocurrencies:

Gaps in consumer and investor protection must be true need to be closed, but measures must be proportionate.
The integrity of the financial system must be guaranteed.
The innovative technique behind cryptocurrency must be preserved, such as cryptography and distributed ledger technology (DLT).
The cross-border nature of cryptocurrencies requires one approach at the international level. National rules can simply be circumvented or difficult to maintain.
The minister further said that given the decentralized and cross-border nature of cryptocurrencies, a ban is not feasible, so it was more important to bring cryptocurrencies under the appropriate regulatory framework and the Dutch join with the French and German finance ministers to discuss cryptocurrency in the G20 context. The Netherlands wants to play a leading role in the European and international approach to cryptocurrency.

In further comments, Hoekstra stated, “I hope the usual process for the realization of legislation and regulations that these new rules can enter into force at the end of 2019. I foresee the changes to the [European Union] Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive will also contribute to the prevention of tax evasion.” This directive, which took effect in June 2017, lays out the most recent parameters and standards adopted by the EU to prevent money-laundering and terrorist funding.

He sees the change as helping to prevent the use of cryptocurrency for the purposes of tax evasion as well. While this letter is not policy, it does reflect the direction that The Netherlands, Europe and much of the world appear to be headed in.

2018/3/13,New York Legislator Proposes BitLicense Alternative for Cryptocurrency Users,"New York State Assembly legislator Ron Kim (D-40) has unveiled a bill that intends to protect cryptocurrency investors and ease the bureaucratic burden on crypto-related businesses. It’s the first comprehensive cryptocurrency bill in New York to make it past studies and commissions and into the hands of the legislative branch. Kim introduced the legislation on March 13, 2018, after he met with blockchain industry leaders on the subject.

Known as The New York Cryptocurrency Exchange Act (A9899), the bill relates to “the audit of cryptocurrency business activity by third party depositories and prohibits licensing fees to conduct such cryptocurrency business activity.”

If it were to take effect, the legislation would make amendments to Section 9 of New York’s Banking Law. With the addition of section 9-x, the law would mandate that any cryptocurrency business or entity be subject to routine audits by a public or third-party depository service. These audits would require that individuals and businesses alike safeguard assets with proper security measures, provide adequate insurance for account holder assets and produce proof-of-asset ownership.

Any entity in full compliance will receive a digital New York Seal of Approval to reassure consumers that the outlet is trustworthy and secure. This seal would ideally replace the BitLicenses currently issued by the New York State Department of Financial Services, doing away with this fee-based license in favor of one earned by audit.

Kim believes that earlier efforts to regulate the space have put enormous burdens on businesses trying to grow and operate in the cryptocurrency space. “What New York needs now,” he told Bitcoin Magazine, “are common-sense laws and security procedures to provide a degree of clarity for both businesses and the public. This legislation will give consumers and companies the confidence needed for widespread adoption of cryptocurrency in New York.”

While the bill is the first of its kind for New York legislators, this isn’t Kim’s first foray into cryptocurrency. As a precursor to the landmark legislation, Kim recently published a brief report titled “The Future of Bitcoin in NY.” His research identifies unregulated exchanges as “the weak point” in the blockchain ecosystem. This vulnerability, coupled with the cost of a BitLicense, has left New York lacking in legitimate crypto-companies and consumer confidence.

According to a statement from Kim’s office, there are currently fewer than 10 BitLicense holders in the entire state of New York, even though there are some 1,000 active job postings in New York for the blockchain industry. It’s Kim’s hope that the new legislation will foster a friendlier environment for companies in the space; one that will attract more business and generate increased revenue by connecting consumers with reliable, state-vetted entities.

Throughout 2017, the United States government remained relatively quiet on the subject of cryptocurrencies and blockchain. While other countries are beginning to outline clear regulations and legislative guidelines, U.S. investors have had their ears filled with conflicting talk from the SEC, the CFTC and various state legislatures.

So far, however, it’s been a busy year for the United State’s regulatory efforts, both on federal and state levels, and The New York Cryptocurrency Exchange Act is yet another installment in a growing series of litigation that finally broaches the topic of cryptocurrency regulations. If anything, the legislation may set a precedent for consumer protections in the industry, as well as a more lenient regulatory approach that might encourage job growth in the industry.",REGULATION,0.9962
2018/3/14,Congressional Hearings: We Must Distinguish Digital Commodities From ICOs,"On March 14, 2018, the House Financial Committee held a hearing entitled “Examining the Cryptocurrencies and ICO Markets.” This was the first hearing in which members of the U.S. Congress, specifically a subcommittee on capital markets, securities and ICO markets, addressed cryptocurrencies and ICOs. Witnesses at the hearing included Dr. Chris Brummer, Professor of Law at Georgetown University Law Center; Mike Lempres, chief legal and risk officer at Coinbase; Robert Rosenblum, a partner at the Silicon Valley law firm Wilson Sonseni Goodrich & Rosati; and Peter Van Valkenburgh, the director of research at Coin Center.

The hearing addressed the economic efficiencies and potential capital formation opportunities that cryptocurrencies and ICOs offer to businesses and investors. It also reviewed the current approach by the SEC, CFTC and state regulators to administer laws which adequately protect investors. Because regulatory clarity so far has been difficult for businesses and investors, members of Congress also expressed interest in how to best monitor and oversee blockchain technology as it moves into the future.

Notable points asked of and addressed by the witnesses included the need for security and investor compliance for U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges; the need (or in Rosenblum’s case, lack thereof) for regulators to distinguish the difference between cryptocurrencies that are considered digitally scarce commodities and securities tokens; the need to establish a harmonization among the “patchwork” of regulatory agencies dictating how to move forward; and the policing of cryptocurrencies, all in such a way that won’t stifle domestic innovation by forcing investors and businesses to leave the country.

Digitally Scarce Commodities and Security Tokens
Distinguishing major cryptocurrencies from the majority of ICO tokens was the biggest topic of conversation during the hearing.

Van Valkenburgh noted that digital scarcity is a fundamental difference between ICOs and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Filecoin.

“The fundamental innovation of Bitcoin is digital scarcity. That digital scarcity can then be employed by innovative people for a variety of innovative purposes. A token that is scarce and transferable from person to person can be used just like money, just as any good throughout history from gold to seashells. A scarce token can also be automatically redeemable for a digital good or computing service provided by the same network of computing participants who verify the blockchain. These are projects like Ethereum, Filecoin and Blockstack and they are beginning to compete with competitors like Amazon, Facebook and Google. A scarce token can also represent a legal agreement.”

Van Valkenburgh went on to distinguish scarce tokens already put into practice from others that are merely theoretical, supported only by blockchain software that has yet to be built. Recently, new blockchain projects have raised money by selling the promise of future tokens to willing investors in ICOs.

From a regulatory standpoint there is a fundamental distinction that must be made between scarce tokens that exist on a blockchain and are used for payment or to obtain computing services and, on the other hand, promises of future tokens representing the hopefully profitable efforts of a developer.
He went on to state that the former scarce tokens are like digital commodities while the latter (ICOs) are securities, both having distinct risks that must be addressed by investors in different ways.

Rosenblum suggested a short– and long-term approach for the SEC and other agencies to modify the regulation rules around cryptocurrencies so that the industry does not get locked into a concrete regulatory system too early. He used the combination of blockchain technology with artificial intelligence to convey why imposing regulations at this time would not be a good idea: 

It could potentially lead to new marketing, business opportunities, scientific and sociological advances. However, the opportunity to use that same technology for manipulative conduct, data breach and other nefarious conduct is really hard to predict right now.
On the subject of regulating ICOs, Brummer emphasized the need for standardized and precise promoter disclosures for investor protection. Speaking primarily about cryptocurrency white papers, essentially the business and technological plan behind each cryptocurrency, Brummer gave a list of recommended standardized disclosures:

Location: Brummer cited one particular study which indicated that in 32 percent of ICOs it is not possible to identify the identity or origin of the ICO issuer or promoter. Without having this information it is very difficult for investors to understand the protection rights or authorities they can contact in case of fraud. Therefore, ICO promoters or issuers should establish a clear statement of where an issuer is located.
Problem and proposed technology solution: The most important information for assessing the success of an ICO is understanding its proposed solution for how the technology will solve a problem: a plain-English explanation of the technology solution. More technical aspects of the white paper would be subject to the validation of a third-party technology audit. All code would be subject to a public repository such as GitHub.
Token proposal: An ICO’s white paper should disclose legal rights of token holders as well as how the tokens will be traded and on what platforms.
Brummer concluded by saying that white papers should also disclose the basic principles of blockchain governance and risk factors, not only for the token itself, but also for the industry as a whole.

Brummer stated that one major point of contention for government regulators on cryptocurrencies might be the fact that “because digital things tend to be more abstract and they therefore tend to be harder to understand,” there is more tension and difficulty in defining them as commodities, unlike gold which is “shiny and universally identified as something that has value.”

Huizenga, in turn, acknowledged that “governmental bureaucracies tend not to view the world through those lenses. And I think that there is a certain governmental responsibility to protect investors.”

A Patchwork of Regulatory Agencies
While distinguishing between a digitally scarce commodity and a security appeared to be the most fundamental and pressing issue, all testifying witnesses acknowledged the need for clear lines in which regulatory agencies operate and monitor the industry. This confusing and often contradictory relationship between the SEC vetting cryptocurrencies, the CFTC policing cryptocurrencies on the spot market, and state regulators has already indicated a level of disorder that could potentially stymie further development within the domestic cryptocurrency and blockchain technology industry.

Again, Van Valkenburgh reiterated that if policymakers get the distinction between digitally scarce commodity tokens and security tokens wrong, they will cede leadership of the technology development to the rest of the world.

Rosenblum suggested that, moving forward, “regulation by enforcement, in an area that is as complicated and dynamic as this, is not the appropriate way to regulate. Enforcement is clearly necessary; however, we need clearer guidelines on the SEC’s registration, market trading and how investment rules should apply and do apply, and that is something that you cannot do through regulation and enforcement.”

Security and Compliance
Congressman Hultgren expressed concern over cybersecurity standards within cryptocurrency. Addressing these concerns, Lempres stated, “Approximately 99 percent of Coinbase cryptocurrency holdings are held in cold storage.” Furthermore, 20 percent of Coinbase’s employees are dedicated to compliance. Lempres also pointed out that the blockchain’s transparent ledger allows for Coinbase to glean insight into bad activity occurring within their system. Lempres also referred to the cybersecurity standards of the state of New York’s “BitLicenses.” So far these BitLicenses have only been administered to four cryptocurrency companies — including Coinbase — and that is the strongest evidence for the security standardization, according to Lempres.

Voices For and Against
Voicing disapproval of cryptocurrency, no one was more direct than Congressman Brad Sherman. “Cryptocurrencies are popular with guys who like to sit in their pajamas and tell their wives they are going to be millionaires. They help terrorists and criminals move money around the world. Tax evaders. They help startup companies commit fraud, take money, and one percent of the time they actually create a useful business.”

Sherman went on to suggest that cryptocurrency hurts the U.S. dollar, prevents the federal government from preventing tax evasion, and takes away from investment that could otherwise be used to develop the American economy. Chairman Huizenga noted that, despite Sherman’s comments, the hearing was to focus on cryptocurrency and blockchain technology and not Dodd Frank reform.

On the other hand, Rep. Tom Emmer, a member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, suggested that the potential for innovation from blockchain technology in American society is something both Republicans and Democrats should welcome.

I tend to trust people and believe that they’re in these things for good, and that they’re trying to improve their own lives and hopefully the lives of people around them — that old adage that a rising tide lifts all boats. And yet I hear elected officials who don’t have any concept of what we’re dealing with here and how exciting it is, talking about how we got to regulate and create more government infrastructure. I respectfully disagree that that won’t act as a wet blanket on this amazing new technology. I realize there has to be some regulation, but there’s got to be balance.",REGULATION,0.9979
2018/3/14,Op Ed: FinCEN Policy Positions Offer Murky Guidance for ICOs,"The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) appears to be taking steps to eliminate some of the ambiguity surrounding the status of ICOs as money services businesses (MSBs). On March 6, 2018, FinCEN released a letter it sent in February to U.S. Senator Ron Wyden (the “Wyden Letter”). The letter stakes out a policy position that could be seen as somewhat inconsistent with prior FinCEN guidance and could foreshadow potential avenues of enforcement. ICOs would be wise to monitor FinCEN’s public statements and, if they haven’t already, should consider developing Bank Secrecy Act compliance programs to protect themselves from substantial fines and criminal liability associated with FinCEN actions.

In the Wyden Letter, FinCEN ostensibly reiterates its position that that virtual currency developers and other businesses that sell virtual currency are Money Services Businesses (specifically money transmitters) under the Bank Secrecy Act and that they “must comply with AML/CFT requirements that apply to this type of MSB.”

Ambiguities and Contradictions
While FinCEN frames the Wyden letter as a reiteration of its previous position, the application of the Bank Secrecy Act to ICO activities has been less clear than FinCEN claims in the Wyden Letter due to its own previously issued interpretive rulings.

In its 2013 Guidance (FIN-2013-G001 “Application of FinCEN’s Regulations to Persons Administering, Exchanging, or Using Virtual Currencies”), FinCEN stated that “a person that creates units of convertible virtual currency and sells those units to another person for real currency or its equivalent is engaged in transmission to another location and is a money transmitter.” However, in a later interpretive ruling, FIN-2014-R001 (referred to as the “Mining Ruling”), FinCEN appeared to partially contravene that statement from the 2013 Guidance.

In the Mining Ruling, FinCEN addressed questions regarding a virtual currency miner’s use of mined virtual currency and seemed to indicate in its analysis that a business’s use of a token was the primary factor in determining the application of the Bank Secrecy Act as opposed to the origin of the token.

The Mining Ruling suggested that so long as a token was sold for a person or business’s own uses, such as for the payment of debts or to make distributions to shareholders, the person or business would be deemed a “user” of virtual currency rather than an “exchanger” or “administrator” of virtual currency.

“Users” of virtual currency are not MSBs, but “exchangers” and “administrators” are MSBs under the 2013 Guidance. This interpretation of the Mining Ruling was somewhat undercut by the Ripple Labs enforcement action (which was settled via an agreement with Ripple), but there has been no additional formal guidance or interpretative rulings by FinCEN to limit or reject an extension of the reasoning in the Mining Ruling to ICO activities.

FinCEN does not address the discrepancies between the 2013 Guidance and the Mining Ruling in the Wyden Letter, but the letter does cite the Mining Ruling in a footnote. Confusingly, FinCEN’s footnote summary of the Mining Ruling seems inconsistent with the conclusions drawn in its full analysis. It may be that FinCEN is attempting to square the circle and is choosing to categorize developers as “administrators” of a virtual currency anytime they conduct a sale of their tokens regardless of the use of the proceeds.

Considerations for ICOs
While the Wyden Letter is not a formal interpretative ruling or formal guidance, this letter should be seen as a warning to all current ICOs and prospective ICOs that FinCEN is paying attention and expects full compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act.

If FinCEN acts according to the interpretation set forth in the Wyden Letter, ICOs that choose or have chosen not to fully comply with the substantive requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act (including registration as an MSB), could face serious consequences including criminal liability and extensive fines.

Token developers should consult with legal counsel or other consultants to develop a Bank Secrecy Act compliance plan as part of their ICO offering. Some of the requirements of a well-designed compliance plan are

(i) conducting a risk assessment;

(ii) developing an effective anti-money laundering program;

(iii) appointing a compliance officer;

(iv) engaging in know-your-customer activities;

(v) complying with recordkeeping and reporting requirements;  

(vi) registering with FinCEN as a money transmitter.

These activities represent a significant, but important, additional investment by developers to ready their tokens and applications for their prospective users.

On a final note, the Wyden Letter does not address the application of limitations or exemptions to the Bank Secrecy Act. ICOs may wish to consult with legal counsel to analyze their plans for raising capital associated with tokens to determine which options are best for them.",REGULATION,0.9194
2018/3/20,Mark Carney: Cryptocurrencies Do Not Pose Serious Risks,"When it comes to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England and chairman of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), is known for being a harsh critic. Though Carney has praised the technology behind cryptocurrency in the past, he has often referred to digital money as a “bubble,” claiming it has failed users and is “no substitute for cash” or credit cards.

“The time has come to hold the crypto-asset ecosystem to the same standards as the rest of the financial system,” Carney told CNBC in early March 2018, further stating that the “average volatility of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization was more than 25 times that of the U.S. equities market in 2017.”

Just days ago, Carney proclaimed that illicit activities surrounding cryptocurrencies were causes for major concern, citing everything from personal wallet thefts to terrorist funding, only now, it appears his sentiment has suddenly changed.

Less than 24 hours before he was scheduled to speak at this year’s G20 meeting, Carney seemingly reversed his stance on digital currencies, saying that they did not pose serious risks to financial stability. Carney and the Board published an official letter on March 18, the eve of the summit, stating:

“The FSB’s initial assessment is that crypto-assets do not pose risks to global financial stability at this time … Their small size, and the fact that they are not substitutes for currency and with very limited use for real economy and financial transactions, has meant the linkages to the rest of the financial system are limited.”

Carney, whose term with the Bank of England ends in 2019, also insinuated that whoever succeeds him in the position is likely to run a more “open” operation, concentrating more on reviewing current rules and regulations, rather than implementing more strenuous standards.

“As its work to fix the fault lines that caused the financial crisis closes, the FSB is increasingly pivoting away from design of new policy initiatives toward dynamic implementation and rigorous evaluation of the effects of the agreed G20 reforms,” he said.

The G20 summit began on March 19, 2018, and will last through March 21. Several economic leaders are gathering in Buenos Aires to discuss cryptocurrencies and the future of the planet’s financial infrastructure.

Despite Carney’s newfound attitude toward digital assets, not every nation agrees that cryptocurrencies aren’t hazardous. Some countries, like France, Germany and Japan, are calling for further regulation, with the Central Bank of Germany stating that bitcoin should be regulated on a “global scale.” France and Germany are allegedly creating a joint proposal for cryptocurrency regulation that representatives will present at this year’s summit.

Carney, himself, explained that while he is pursuing a more “balanced approach” toward cryptocurrencies, the financial system will likely mold and change as more is understood about them:

“The market continues to evolve rapidly, and this initial assessment could change if crypto-assets were to become significantly more widely used or interconnected with the core of the regulated financial system.”

Still, it seems most virtual currency advocates have something to celebrate since, aside from his more lenient stance on coins themselves, Carney feels that the technology behind cryptocurrency has the potential to enhance and assist the economy as needed.",REGULATION,0.2584
2018/3/23,Binance Seeks New Home in Malta’s Fintech-Friendly Environment,"After facing crackdowns in China and being issued a warning by regulators in Japan, cryptocurrency exchange Binance is now seeking a home on the crypto-friendly island nation of Malta, the company’s CEO Zhao Changpeng told Bloomberg.  

Malta is known for extending open arms to fintech and blockchain technology. Malta Prime Minister Joseph Muscat underscored that policy when he shared the Bloomberg piece on Twitter, stating, “We aim to be the global trailblazers in the regulation of blockchain-based businesses and the jurisdiction of quality and choice for world class fintech companies.”

Since it was founded in Hong Kong in 2017, Binance has grown rapidly to become the largest exchange in the world by trading volume. Establishing itself in Malta could open doors to even larger growth. Currently, the exchange is negotiating with banks in Malta to set up a formal banking partnership, Zhao told Bloomberg.

If it succeeds, that means Binance, which now offers only crypto-to-crypto trading pairs, will be able to offer crypto-to-fiat trading pairs. In that sense, Binance would operate similar to U.S.-based exchange Coinbase, where users have direct links to their bank accounts and can withdraw and deposit fiat.

Banking relationships are essential to the livelihood of exchanges. Without the ability to allow customers to move in and out of the fiat world, exchanges turn to stable tokens, like tether (USDT) or trueUSD (TUSD), as a fiat alternative and to protect against market volatility. But stablecoins present their own class of problems. For instance, it is not necessarily clear if they are backed by real dollars.

Despite that, Malta may be the quiet home Binance is looking for. In April 2017, Malta rolled out an ambitious strategy for blockchain technology in a push for the small Mediterranean country to become a “Silicon Valley” of Europe. Currently, Malta is in the process of setting up a Malta Digital Innovation Authority to certify blockchain companies and establish a legal framework for initial coin offerings (ICOs).  

Malta is among several small European countries, including Lithuania and Belarus, that are creating fintech-friendly regulatory environments to capture a larger role for themselves in the growing blockchain and financial technology space.",REGULATION,0.9549
2018/3/23,Japan’s FSA Warns Binance to Comply with Licensing Requirements,"Japan’s top securities regulator has issued a formal warning to cryptocurrency exchange Binance that it needs to comply with licensing requirements in order to continue operations.



The news, which the Financial Services Agency (FSA) published in a statement on Friday, March 23, 2018, confirms earlier rumors reported by news outlet Nikkei that an FSA warning was forthcoming, given the exchange was already operating in the country without a license.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao initially took to Twitter to deny those rumors, accusing Nikkei of “irresponsible journalism.” He stated Binance was in communication with the FSA. “It does not make sense for JFSA to tell a newspaper before telling us, while we have an active dialog going on with them.”

But after the FSA warning became public, he tweeted, “We received a simple letter from JFSA about an hour ago. Our lawyers called JFSA immediately, and will find a solution.” In an attempt to quell customer concerns, he later tweeted, “No need to worry. Some negative news often turn out to be positive in the long term.”

Binance, which is based in Hong Kong, had been expanding its operations into Japan, employing several staff in the country. At the same time, according to Nikkei, the exchange was failing to perform proper identity checks on Japanese investors when they opened their accounts on the exchange. It is likely many of those investors were lured to Binance from domestic exchanges by the lower fees offered on the exchange.

In 2017, Japan became one of the first countries to regulate cryptocurrency exchanges when it set up a licensing system. Now, only cryptocurrency exchanges that are licensed by the FSA or have licenses pending are allowed to operate in the country.

Following an incident earlier this year where $530 million worth of NEM tokens were stolen from Tokyo exchange Coincheck due to lax security measures, the FSA doubled down its oversight. Earlier this month, the FSA penalized seven exchanges due to their failure to provide proper internal control systems.

So far, Japan has 16 licensed cryptocurrency exchanges. Next month, those exchanges plan to form a self-regulating body that will work with the FSA to establish and enforce best practices within the industry, including setting up guidelines for ICOs.

Launched in summer 2017, Binance raised money for its operations by issuing its own initial coin offering (ICO). It has since grown to become one of the busiest exchanges with a 24-hour trading volume of $1.9 billion. Binance lists 118 actively trading coins but does not support fiat pairs. Instead, it supports tether (USDT), a stable coin pegged to the dollar.  

Recently, Binance announced plans to launch its own public blockchain to serve as the foundation for a decentralized exchange dubbed Binance Chain.

According to Bloomberg, Binance has plans to move its staff to Malta in order to avoid clashing with regulators.",REGULATION,-0.5085
2018/3/26,Op Ed: A Quick-Start Token Sale Compliance Guide: What You Need to Know,"Compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules and with the economic sanctions administered by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) can be a daunting task for any business. When it comes to the fast-moving world of token sales and cryptocurrencies in general, much of the legal and regulatory landscape is yet to be settled, but the obligation to comply with AML and OFAC laws is clear. This quick start guide to AML and OFAC compliance aims to provide entrepreneurs and in-house counsel an early roadmap for planning and reaching their compliance goals as they think about kicking off a token sale.

This guide focuses on U.S. laws, but be aware that other countries also have laws in these two areas.

Steer Clear of Tainted Funds: Watch for Red Flags
It states the obvious, of course, to say steer clear of tainted funds. But whether you are starting a new cryptocurrency exchange business or selling tokens to raise money for your new project, it takes intentional focus and care to ensure that the funds moving into and through your business are not the product of illegal activity. With several recent notorious examples of theft, fraud and money laundering fresh in the minds of government regulators and investigators, it is even more imperative that entrepreneurs establish and use the right anti-money laundering procedures up front.

Whether your business model or planned token sale requires that you have a formal anti-money laundering program in place or not, you are always required to avoid conducting transactions involving criminal proceeds. Among others things, federal anti-money laundering laws prohibit the following types of financial transactions:

Concealment or Promotion Money Laundering, 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1): This statute prohibits a transaction in the proceeds of crime in which a person knows that the property involved comes from some form of unlawful activity, even if that person does not know the precise nature of the underlying criminal activity. To be in violation of this law, there must be an intent on the part of the person conducting the transaction — most often proven through circumstantial evidence — to conceal the true nature, location, source, ownership or control of the funds, or to reinvest in or “promote” future criminal activity.
International Money Laundering, 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(2): This law applies even to “clean” funds that are not currently the proceeds of criminal activity but are sent internationally to “promote” certain categories of criminal activity.
Money Spending Statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1957: Applicable to transactions in criminal proceeds over $10,000, this law simply prohibits transactions where the participant (including currency exchangers, money transmitters, and brokers or dealers in securities or commodities) knows the funds are from some unlawful source.
Money Laundering Conspiracy, 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h): Two or more individuals who intend to conduct a transaction in criminal proceeds may be liable for any foreseeable offenses committed by their co-conspirators in furtherance of the scheme.
Not only are the above offenses subject to criminal or civil prosecution, but the proceeds of criminal activity, as well as any property “involved” in a money-laundering offense — which may include such things as non-tainted funds in the same account, commissions or fees, websites or even an entire business — are subject to criminal or civil forfeiture.

In this environment, then, is it enough, for example, to require a buyer of your tokens to represent to you in writing that the funds they are paying you with are “clean”? Maybe, but maybe not. If your buyer makes that representation but there are red flags around the transaction suggesting otherwise, those representations by themselves will not insulate you from liability.

As we discuss below, if your business model puts you in the category of being a money services business, you will need to take additional steps. If not, you will still want to make sure you know and understand your customer and their transaction; be on the lookout for transaction details that are not customary; and keep records of your due diligence.

You May Need to Register as a Money Services Business
Probably the most significant question you will need to answer in relation to your anti-money laundering obligations as you prepare to undertake a token sale is whether your sale amounts to “money transmitting” under federal law. Be aware that “money transmitters” are also highly regulated under each state’s laws, many of which require advance licensure; however, because state money transmitting laws are typically aimed at consumer protection rather than anti-money laundering, we do not address the issue of state regulation here other than to note that there is no uniform licensing scheme across the 50 states.

Under federal law, “financial institutions,” which include “money transmittersx” (a category of “money services businesses”), are regulated under the Bank Secrecy Act, 31 U.S.C. 5311, et seq., and are subject to a number of specific requirements that are defined and overseen by the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). According to FinCEN, “money transmitting services” means:

the acceptance of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency from one person and the transmission of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency to another location or person by any means.
FinCEN issued guidance in 2013 making clear that it views its money-transmitting regulations as applying to “persons creating, obtaining, distributing, exchanging, accepting or transmitting virtual currencies.” With regard to token issuers using a decentralized network, FinCEN has concluded that anyone who qualifies as a virtual currency “exchanger” is a money transmitter.

Even more specifically, while not formal industry guidance, in a letter responding to a Member of Congress (that became public in early March but was issued on February 13, 2018), FinCEN expressed its view that initial coin offerings (“ICOs”) qualify as money transmitting, stating:

A developer that sells convertible virtual currency, including in the form of ICO coins or tokens, in exchange for another type of value that substitutes for currency is a money transmitter and must comply with AML/[Combating the Financing of Terrorism] requirements that apply to [MSBs].
Importantly, entities or individuals who do not follow these rules and that operate an unlicensed money transmitting business are subject to criminal prosecution under 18 U.S.C. § 1960. Yet, to further complicate matters, FinCEN’s letter also noted that an ICO involving securities or derivatives might instead be subject to the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission or Commodity Futures Trading Commission, each of which have separate — although similar — AML/CFT requirements.

Ultimately, whether you will need to register with FinCEN as a money transmitter is going to depend on the specific facts and circumstances of your token sale and business model, but you will want to consider this question carefully.

If You Are a Money Services Business, Special AML Requirements Apply
If you are a money transmitter and subject to FinCEN’s regulations, you are subject to a number of specific requirements. First, you must register as a money-transmitting business within 180 days from the date the business was established and maintain a list of any agents working with you. Most broadly, money transmitters are required to:

develop, implement and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program, reasonably designed to prevent the money services business from being used to facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities.
Additionally, you will be subject to a number of reporting and record-keeping requirements, particularly the requirement to file Suspicious Activity Reports, or SARs, for transactions over $2,000 that appear to involve funds from illicit activity; be designed to evade reporting requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act; or serve no apparent lawful or business purpose.

To meet AML requirements, money transmitters must have a formal AML compliance program that includes the following four elements: 1) written policies and procedures; 2) a designated AML compliance officer; 3) independent review and monitoring of the AML program; and 4) a training program for relevant personnel regarding their AML responsibilities.

Finally, while it may be possible to assign the responsibilities for your AML program to a founder, manager or employee with other duties if your business does not currently support a stand-alone function, keep in mind that it is critical that this function be resourced and, most importantly, free from the influence of the business or sales side of the organization.

Operating a money transmitting business without meeting these requirements established by the Bank Secrecy Act could subject both your business and the individuals involved in it to civil and criminal penalties.

Do You Have Foreign Partners or Corporate Customers? Take These Extra Steps
Many participants in the cryptocurrency and token sale marketplace are based outside of the United States. If you have what FinCEN refers to as foreign “agents” — a term it uses to include “authorized delegates, foreign agents or counterparties, agents and sub-agents” — your AML program must meet additional requirements.

For example, if you have a contractual arrangement to make your tokens available to a foreign company or its customers through the foreign company’s software platform, you must:

conduct due diligence on foreign agents and counterparties;
consider a number of particular risk factors and do risk-based monitoring of your agents and counterparties; and
develop and implement a policy for corrective action and termination for non-compliant entities.
While you may be able to contractually allocate the responsibility for developing these policies, procedures and internal controls to your agent or counterparty, you will remain liable to ensure that they are fully operational.

OFAC Compliance: An AML Program Is Not Enough
Every U.S. person and business is required to avoid engaging in financial transactions with certain individuals, entities and countries that are subject to U.S. economic sanctions. Accordingly, when you offer your tokens for sale in a public or private offering, it is your obligation to ensure that none of your purchasers are on the list of prohibited individuals or entities maintained by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). You also need to be sure that your customers and other business partners are not based in countries subject to broader economic sanctions, the list of which currently includes Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria and the Crimean region of Ukraine.

Compliance with the economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC and compliance with the AML laws established under the Bank Secrecy Act are often considered in the same breath. And, while effective OFAC screening and AML programs will certainly have areas of overlap, namely a robust customer identification procedure, they are two separate and distinct programs and responsibilities and you should have separate procedures for each.

OFAC compliance involves screening the names of individuals or entities against a highly complex and often-changing list of sanctioned parties, countries and regions. Most companies make use of third-party servicers to conduct this screening on their behalf, but it is prudent to do some due diligence to ensure those service providers themselves have the sophistication required to capture any potential prohibited transactions.

Can you shortcut this process by simply having your token buyer represent they are not on the OFAC sanctions list? While such representations are helpful, they are not sufficient. Unlike the risk-based compliance expectations, with AML requirements, you are strictly liable for OFAC screening failures and OFAC can pursue even minor violations.

Nonetheless, should you be found to have violated economic sanctions laws, the strength of your OFAC compliance program, along with your state of mind and other factors, will be considered in the determination of any penalty.

Be Ready to Demonstrate Your AML and OFAC Compliance
As with any business, when operating in the cryptocurrency space, you should be prepared for questions from a regulator or investigator with jurisdiction over the activity. Whether you are a money transmitter with a formal written AML program or not, one of the first demands you are likely to receive in any federal or state inquiry is to produce a copy of your AML program and policies as well as your customer identification procedures and screening protocols.

Examiners or investigators will be looking at whether you have taken the time to recognize and identify risk factors and risk categories for the counterparties with whom you are doing business. And they will look to see whether you have developed procedures intended to mitigate those risks and avoid conducting transactions with or for blocked parties or illicit funds. If you are equipped with written AML guidance and OFAC screening processes, including a clear allocation of responsibility within your company for ensuring compliance, you will be off to a good start.

There Is Room for Innovation
Federal agencies involved in regulating and overseeing the marketplace for token sales recognize the value to our society of the emerging technologies behind this activity, even if they are scrambling to catch up with the technology on an institutional level. While the burden to a new company of meeting the legal and regulatory requirements for AML and OFAC compliance is not insignificant, prior planning in these areas will protect your investment of time and resources and create room for greater innovation.",REGULATION,0.9996
2018/3/27,Twitter Abruptly Bans Cryptocurrency Ads — Beginning Today,"Twitter is a fast player. Less than two weeks ago, the social media giant announced it was developing new policies which would lead to the eventual ban of cryptocurrency and ICO-related advertisements on its platform. Bitcoin enthusiasts everywhere likely figured they had a little time to spare, as the changes weren’t expected to take effect until sometime in April at the earliest.

In addition, it was reported that Twitter would also be banning ads for cryptocurrency exchanges, though there would allegedly be exceptions to the rule.

Executive speculation has now reached an end, as the ban of cryptocurrency marketing strategies takes full effect on March 27, 2018. Twitter was the third major internet mogul to announce such a ban after Google and Facebook, but the first to implement it, leading to questions over whether the industry could be damaged in the long term.

“We are committed to ensuring the safety of the Twitter community,” the enterprise confirmed to The Verge in a statement. “As such, we have added a new policy for Twitter Ads related to cryptocurrency. Under this new policy, the advertisement of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and token sales will be prohibited globally.”

Twitter also said that it will end campaigns for cryptocurrency exchanges and digital wallet services.

“We know that this type of content is often associated with deception and fraud, both organic and paid, and we are proactively implementing several signals to prevent these types of accounts from engaging with others in a deceptive manner,” the company said to Bloomberg.

Following the announcement, bitcoin’s price fell by over 7 percent. At press time, the currency is trading for approximately $7,900 — about $700 less than where it stood over the weekend on March 25.

Speaking with TechCrunch, a Twitter representative said the company “will continue and improve upon” its new policies “as the industry evolves.”

Twitter’s attitude and actions toward cryptocurrencies have undoubtedly led to both pain and success in the arena. Only a few weeks ago, the company began removing accounts it felt were impersonating the portfolios or personalities of notable cryptocurrency figures, such as Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin and John McAfee. This ultimately led to serious problems, like the real people — not their impersonators — being banned instead.

At the same time, however, Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey has offered bitcoin some of its highest praise in recent years. In an interview with The Times, Dorsey confidently exclaimed that within 10 years, bitcoin would likely stand as the world’s “single” currency, and that fiat or other forms of virtual money would become obsolete or nonexistent.

“The world ultimately will have a single currency,” he stated. “The internet will have a single currency. I personally believe that it will be bitcoin.”

He later commented that bitcoin does not presently have the means to serve as “effective” cash for all, citing its slow transaction speeds, costly trading fees and general volatility as the main issues to overcome, though he does believe the public will garner greater access to bitcoin in the future as the technology behind it improves.",REGULATION,0.7684
2018/3/29,Two More Japanese Exchanges Shutter Their Businesses,"Two more Japanese cryptocurrency exchanges are closing their operations. This adds to three other exchanges in the country closing their doors after regulators stepped up oversight in the wake of the late-January hack of Tokyo-based Coincheck, where $530 million in NEM tokens vanished.

According to revised payment services laws that went into force in April 2017, when Japan made bitcoin a nationally accepted cryptocurrency, any virtual currency exchange that wants to do business in the country or solicit its citizens needs to be licensed with Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA).

As reported by Nikkei, Tokyo GateWay and Mr. Exchange are now withdrawing their applications to register as exchange operators. Both companies must return customers’ cash and cryptocurrency holdings before they close. Mr. Exchange was among those issued orders on March 8, 2018, to improve data security and other safeguards.

The FSA began issuing its first licenses in September 2017. So far, 16 exchanges are now fully licensed. Another 16, including Coincheck, have been allowed to continue operating as “quasi-operators” for an undetermined amount of time until they bring their safety standards up to date. Quasi-operator is a special category relegated to exchanges that started their businesses before the registration system was put into place.  

Since then, the FSA has been grappling with how to deal with its quasi-operators. After the Coincheck theft, the FSA doubled down and began doing on-the-spot checks for all quasi-operators to make sure they were taking proper measures to protect customers. Since some operators have little hope of meeting the agency's standards, the FSA has given them the option to step down on their own before ordering them to do so.

So far, among the 16 with quasi-operating status, Raimu, bitExpress, BitStation, and now Tokyo GateWay and Mr. Exchange have bowed out voluntarily. Earlier this month, the FSA ordered BitStation along with FSHO to suspend operations for a month while they dealt with their compliance issues.  

Last week, Binance, the largest exchange by 24-hour trading volume, was also issued a warning by the FSA, as it had begun operations in Japan without a license. Binance, originally based in Hong Kong, is now seeking to relocate to Malta, although it says it is also working with Japanese regulators to remedy its situation there in the meantime.

Japan learned its lesson in the need for setting up systems to oversee cryptocurrency exchanges after Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox collapsed in February 2014, reportedly losing some 850,000 bitcoins (worth $6.7 billion today). At the time, Mt. Gox was the largest virtual currency exchange in the world.",REGULATION,0.9083
2018/3/30,Op Ed: France’s Emerging Cryptocurrency Policy Appears Optimistically Vague,"On March 19, 2018, in an op-ed published by the French news website, Numerama, France’s Minister of Finance and Economics, Bruno Le Maire wrote what appears, at least at first glance, to be an uncharacteristically optimistic exposition on the profound and pioneering nature of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology:

“A revolution is underway, of which bitcoin was only the precursor. The blockchain will offer new opportunities to our startups, for example with the Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) that will allow them to raise funds through ‘tokens,’ crypto-actives or not. It promises to create a network of trust without intermediaries, to offer increased traceability of transactions and, overall, to make the economy more efficient.”

The op-ed is a message to the French public that this emerging technology will be an agent of change — both disruptive and beneficial. According to Le Maire, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies “could upset daily practices in the banking and insurance sectors, financial markets, but also patents and certified acts.” He goes on to warn what has been echoed by leaders of other nations, that there should be anticipated consequences for traditional players.

“Let’s not be mere spectators: become actors in this revolution,” he urged. Le Maire goes on to state that France’s policy should be benevolent yet cautious. He expressed weariness for the chaotic nature of decentralization by questioning speculative products, investor security and the ever-present possibility that the technology could be used to launder or fund criminal activities.

“Clarifying the law to attract innovation, identify risks without hindering our ecosystem, that's our approach,” wrote Le Maire. He goes on to advocate for a former French central bank governor, Jean-Pierre Landau, who has been assigned to further investigate cryptocurrencies to formulate a proposal for a more navigable regulatory framework.

The op-ed concludes with, “Il s’agit là du rôle de la France: Être force de proposition pour construire le monde de demain,” which loosely translates to, “This is the role of France: Be proactive in building the world of tomorrow.""

Blockchain Bisque
Le Maire’s op-ed is uncharacteristic for two reasons. First, the news website, Numerama plays to an audience who are in favor of the open source movement. Founded as Ratiatum in 2002, the publication originally focused only on peer-to-peer and culture-related topics until it was rebranded as Numerama. While Numerama is said to defend the “free-sharing culture” and “respect of privacy,” a reader (Mmastoc) complained in the comments section of the mismatch between Numerama and the blunted public-announcement style of Le Maire’s op-ed, “For pity’s sake, I beg you, not the government soup.”

The sentiment is repeated in some way by several other commentators; the point being, that a publication as critical of centralized authority as Numerama publishing a public message about cryptocurrency adoption by the central government gives an overly optimistic, if not artificial and incomplete, view of government policy.

The other reason why the op-ed comes across as ineffectual is its vague optimism toward less cryptocurrency regulation. Based on what has happened earlier this year in France and other nations, Le Maire’s cryptocurrency policy, and by association the French government’s, has tended to lean hard toward heavier regulation.

For instance, Jean-Pierre Landau — the central banker for whom Le Maire advocates in the op-ed and has entrusted to build a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency — is a notable Bitcoin skeptic who denounced the cryptocurrency back in 2014 in his own op-ed for the Financial Times. Landau’s argument is that currencies need central banks to be successful so that adjustments to the monetary supply can be made; therefore, bitcoin’s scarcity (small supply) will be insufficient to satisfy demand and, as a result, the economy as a whole.

While it might not be clear what Landau thinks four years later, Le Maire appointed Landau to lead a working group for the purpose of regulating cryptocurrencies back in the middle of January 2018.

G20 Discussions
Shortly after Le Maire’s op-ed, world leaders met in Argentina for the G20 Summit and, specifically, the greatest event for cryptocurrency regulation so far in 2018. Despite the changing views of Mike Carney, governor of the Bank of England and chairman of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), who has eased up on cryptocurrencies, France has advocated for a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies that they are now pursuing with Germany. This cooperation is evidence that the call from German central banks for effective regulation of virtual currencies on a international scale is an opinion shared by many French authorities.

These developments, no doubt, are linked to an increased regulatory focus on cryptocurrencies in other countries such as China, South Korea and the U.S. Future cryptocurrency regulation will almost certainly require international cooperation for it to move forward ,given these recent developments and the cross-border attributes of cryptocurrency in general.

The G20 ultimately determined that cryptocurrencies should be regulated as property for now, though it is likely they will be regulated as their own unique asset class as time moves on. World leaders also left the G20 with an agreed upon notion to have effective regulations in place by July 2018.

French Liberty?
If France has recently decided to cultivate a suitable environment for cryptocurrency, credit is due in large part to Laure de La Raudière. Raudière is a republican who represents the Eure-et-Loir department in the National Assembly of France (lower house of the bicameral parliament of France).

She was also appointed in early February to lead the National Assembly’s “Mission d’information.” The purpose of the mission has been to investigate blockchain technology in France and abroad to produce reports that will inform legislators on topics related to how the technology can be used and should be regulated. The mission is expected to take no more than six to seven months since February, meaning it should be wrapping up around the time the G20 world leaders will reconvene for regulation consensus.

Though French authorities appear determined not to let the technological innovation of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology to pass them by, time will tell where they will inevitably fit on the global regulation spectrum. L’Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) has also gone after specific cryptocurrency players who are not registered with the AMF.

In an article from February, Raudière was quoted as stating something much more optimistic and yet, less vague,

To avoid mis-legislating, you have to understand. I have always enrolled in this approach of technology education, focusing on highlighting the repercussions of the prohibition of a technology. For example, at the time of the HADOPI debate, amendments aimed at banning peer-to-peer technology; it revealed a total misunderstanding that technology can be used to achieve illegal things but also to accomplish extremely positive things.Most of the time, it's not the technology you have to ban, but the way it's used.",REGULATION,0.4019
2018/4/5,"In a Blow to Bitcoin, India Bans Banks from Dealing in Cryptocurrencies","In what amounts to a major clampdown down on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced in a press release today, April 5, 2018, that it is banning banks and regulated financial entities from dealing with digital currencies.

“In view of the associated risks, it has been decided that, with immediate effect, entities regulated by RBI shall not deal with or provide services to any individual or business entities dealing with or settling [virtual currencies],” India’s central bank said.   

What this means is that banks will no longer be able to transfer money to a crypto wallet or to an exchange. Regulated entities already providing such services will have three months to wind down their cryptocurrency-related operations, RBI Deputy Governor BP Kanungo told reporters at a media briefing on Thursday.  

At the same time, India has not given up on the idea of issuing a virtual currency of its own. ""While many central banks are still engaged in the debate, an inter-departmental group has been constituted by the Reserve Bank to study and provide guidance on the desirability and feasibility to introduce a central bank digital currency,” the central bank said, adding that a report would be ready in June 2018.

The RBI has been highly critical of cryptocurrencies including bitcoin in the past. On three occasions, the central bank has cautioned holders and traders against the risks of using virtual currencies. RBI issued its first warning in December 2013, a second in February 2017 and the most recent in December 2017.

India, a fiat-reliant country, began tightening the noose on cryptocurrencies in 2018 in an effort to prevent money laundering, sponsorship of terrorism and tax evasion. In January 2018, India’s Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told the Indian parliament, “Bitcoins or such cryptocurrencies are not legal tender and those indulging in such transactions are doing it at their own risk.”",REGULATION,-0.8768
2018/4/6,Coinbase Takes Steps Toward Becoming an Alternative Trading System,"Cryptocurrency trading firm Coinbase has entered into talks with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission about registering as a licensed broker-dealer firm and electronic trading venue, The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, April 6, 2018.

The move comes just as U.S. regulators have begun clarifying their stance on virtual currencies. Testifying before the Senate on February 6, 2018, SEC chairman Jay Clayton made it clear that he considered all initial coin offering (ICO) tokens to be securities.

While it is likely that regulatory laws surrounding ICOs will only be settled in court (perhaps even the Supreme Court), if ICO tokens are legally classified as securities, any exchange that wants to list those tokens needs to either register as a national securities exchange or operate under an exemption and set itself up as an alternative trading system (ATS).

As the SEC spelled out in its statement on March 7, 2018, any entity that wants to become an ATS needs to register with the SEC as a broker-dealer and become a member of a self-regulating organization (SRO), such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). “An ATS must comply with the federal securities laws and its SRO's rules and file a Form ATS with the SEC,” the statement reads.

In a possible lead-up to its plans on becoming an ATS, on March 26, 2018, San Francisco-based Coinbase announced it was adding support for ERC20 into all its trading platforms. ERC20 is the Ethereum technical standard that the majority of ICO tokens are based on. “This paves the way for supporting ERC20 assets across Coinbase products in the future, though we aren’t announcing support for any specific assets or features at this time,” Coinbase said in a blog post.

Coinbase is not alone in making moves toward becoming an ATS. Recently, mobile payment app company Circle acquired Poloniex, another U.S.-based exchange, with plans to “clean up” the exchange. A slide that was initially leaked from a Circle presentation stated, “Circle has briefed the SEC on the transaction and indicated that upon closing that we will begin the process of registering the new entity with the SEC and FINRA as a Broker/Dealer and in turn as a licensed ATS…”

On March 7, 2018, Bittrex has also said that it is in communication with the SEC, stating on its website “... we look forward to continuing our proactive dialogue with the SEC and other regulators on how to build a secure, fully-regulated environment for blockchain that encourages innovation and economic growth.”",REGULATION,0.987
2018/4/6,South Africans Instructed to Pay Tax on Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Earnings,"South Africa has joined a growing list of countries that expect citizens to pay income tax on their cryptocurrency earnings.

The South African Revenue Service (SARS) released a statement today, April 6, 2018, making it clear that, even though the country does not consider cryptocurrencies legal tender, you still have to pay taxes on the gains.

That means that anyone who is paid for goods or services in bitcoin must declare that just as they would ordinary income. Also, traders who make money buying cryptocurrencies at a low and selling at a high will have to pay capital gains on any profits. Further, anyone who mines cryptocurrencies will have to pay taxes on the money they make as well.

“The onus is on taxpayers to declare all cryptocurrency-related taxable income in the tax year in which it is received or accrued. Failure to do so could result in interest and penalties,” SARS said.

SARS still has yet to make clear the value added tax (VAT) status of bitcoin. ""The 2018 annual budget review indicates that the VAT treatment of cryptocurrencies will be reviewed. Pending policy clarity in this regard, SARS will not require VAT registration as a vendor for purposes of the supply of cryptocurrencies,"" SARS said.

South Africa is not alone in taxing bitcoin. Many countries, including the U.S., Japan and South Korea, tax all gains arising from selling, trading and purchasing items with cryptocurrencies, as well as gains accrued through mining and chain-splits.

As reported by the Wall Street Journal, bitcoin use has surged in South Africa amid political and economic instability in the country, where it can be used to transfer money without restriction due to sanctions or going through a bank.

In the past, South Africa has taken an open-minded stance on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. In 2014, the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) issued a position paper on virtual currencies where it declared that virtual currency has “no legal status or regulatory framework” and is, therefore, unregulated in South Africa. But in July 2017, SARB began to work with blockchain-based solutions provider Bankymoon to test out a number of new cryptocurrency regulations in the country.",REGULATION,-0.1027
2018/4/9,Here’s How Taxes Are Harming Bitcoin’s Usefulness as a Payment Method,"While most of the early buzz around Bitcoin centered on it as a new, fast, cheap and permissionless method of online payment, the focus has moved from medium of exchange to store of value over the past few years. It’s clear that bitcoin is useful for censorship-resistant payments that may not otherwise be possible without this new technology, but much more of the recent hype has been around tracking the price more than anything else at this point.

Although general activity on the Bitcoin network has continued to rise, a recent report from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis shows that a growing percentage of this activity is related to trading on exchanges.

There are a variety of reasons as to why the average person on the street is not interested in using bitcoin for payments. For example, the user interfaces are still hard for non-techies to use, network congestion leads to high fees, and price volatility is not something people are used to dealing with in their wallets (at least in most developed countries).

On top of that, one other key issue is often overlooked: capital gains taxes.

Who’s Reporting Capital Gains Taxes on Purchases Made via Bitcoin?
In the United States and many other countries, capital gains taxes must be paid every time an individual uses some of their bitcoin stash to make a purchase, as long as the bitcoin price has gone up since those bitcoin were first acquired.

For example, let’s say someone buys 1 bitcoin when the price is $1,000. This person simply holds that bitcoin for a couple of years, and then it is eventually worth $10,000. If this person goes to the store and purchases a television for $500, they’re effectively selling a portion of their bitcoin holdings at a profit. These gains are supposed to be taxed.

When you imagine this person earning bitcoin on a regular basis and buying something as small as a meal or a coffee every day, it becomes easy to see how keeping track of everything would be quite cumbersome, especially when bitcoin wallets offer pretty much zero assistance in this area at this time.

Even if the buyer and seller involved in a transaction are both bitcoin enthusiasts, it wouldn’t make much sense to make a deal denominated in bitcoin; the tax headache is not worth it.

Instead, it makes much more sense for individuals in places like the United States to simply convert $1,000 or so worth of their bitcoin holdings to the local currency by way of a bitcoin debit card for spending every now and then.

It’s unclear how many people have effectively become tax evaders by accident because they’re spending their bitcoin gains without reporting them. Obviously, those involved in illicit activities tend to be less concerned with the tax implications of using bitcoin for online payments because they’re already attempting to hide these transactions from the authorities anyway.

The Cryptocurrency Fairness Act
So what’s the solution to the usability issues caused by capital gains taxes? One might be through a change in tax law, at least in the United States.

The Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act introduced in Congress last year would exempt bitcoin transactions under $600 from capital gains taxation. This means bitcoin users would only have to calculate the tax implications of their bitcoin payments if they’re in amounts greater than $600. Notably, this is the same exemption that already applies to foreign currencies.

The passage of this act would do wonders for the usability of bitcoin for payments by Americans.

Hedging Options Could Also Help
Another useful tool for avoiding tax-related usability issues with bitcoin may be hedging options in wallets. This is already available with Abra.

The basic idea is that you hold bitcoin in a smart contract hedged to U.S. dollars or any other currency to avoid bitcoin’s price volatility. This setup would be useful for anyone who is interested in using bitcoin for payments but not necessarily gaining exposure to the price swings of the cryptoasset.

If someone can hold bitcoins as U.S. dollars, they no longer have to worry about gains or losses whenever they make a transaction; however, they also lose access to the store-of-value properties of bitcoin in this situation.",REGULATION,-0.34
2018/4/10,"A ""Law-Abiding"" Blockchain Alternative for India’s Financial Exchanges","On April 5, 2018, a blow to bitcoin occurred when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) banned banks and regulated financial entities from dealing with cryptocurrency.

Despite the media report that 10 percent of Bitcoin transactions happen in India, the news does not come as a surprise, considering how the nation has clamped down on cryptocurrency regulation so far this year. Since 2013, the nation’s financial regulators have warned about the difficulties of controlling cryptocurrencies and, like most other stricter regulatory governments, preventing the new asset classes’ most nefarious use cases: money laundering and terrorist financing.

The Indian regulators’ treatment of cryptocurrency is even less of a surprise when considering what they have done in the past to their own fiat currency, the Indian rupee. Back in 2016, the RBI announced the demonetization (stripping a currency of its value) of all ₹500 and ₹1,000 banknotes of the Indian rupee, stating the action would help crack down on murky shadow economy activity (counterfeiting, terrorism, etc.).

Based on this information, it’s not a stretch to assume that a seemingly anonymous and sovereignless computer currency should seem out of RBI’s monetary policy comfort zone. Taking the time to perform due diligence might also be a detracting task for a government that wants to maintain tight regulatory control but also has other, more politically crucial projects to execute.

India’s Other Political Projects
In a 2018 world economic report, the International Monetary Fund stated that Asia accounted for over half of the world’s economic growth within the last year; within Asia, India has been recognized as the fastest-growing nation.

Another report indicated that to meet its accelerating growth, India has invested a record $18 billion this year (March 2017-18) to build and improve roads. These efforts are a part of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s greater goals and promises to increase employment and connectivity through increased government spending on infrastructure.

Even as the RBI is banning financial entities from dealing with cryptocurrency, it continues to explore blockchain technology and the utility of employing its own cryptocurrency. One company that worked as an advisor and eventually contributed to a white paper RBI published on blockchain technology is MonetaGo. On its website, MonetaGo describes itself as “simple blockchain integration with legacy systems,” that “works with financial institutions and central banks around the world to provide permissioned blockchain solutions.” In a word, MonetaGo does private blockchains. Also, they take credit as the first real (meaning live with no fall-back system) blockchain deployment solution in India and one of a few worldwide.

While the MonetaGo CTO Brendan Taylor explicitly stated that the Reserve Bank of India had “nothing to do with this particular deployment,” he did state that “the RBI has been publicly supportive of exploring blockchain technology for the use cases we [MonetaGo] are examining.”

Hashing to Prevent “Shotgunning”
Bitcoin Magazine spoke to Taylor to find out more about MonetaGo’s deployed blockchain solution. Essentially, MonetaGo provides a platform that prevents fraud when financing receivables. The Reserve Bank of India has provided three licenses to three exchange entities: RXIL, A.TReDS and M1xchange. (Note: These licenses are not directly related to the MonetaGo platform; they are for operation of the exchanges normal business.) Even though each of these exchanges competes within India’s receivable financing market, they can use MonetaGo to prevent systemic fraud, financing the same receivable on multiple exchanges simultaneously.

“It’s a pretty common flaw in the U.S. and anywhere else in the world where you’re financing an asset. It’s called ‘shooting the gap’ or ‘shotgunning.’ Someone tries to finance an asset multiple times as quickly as possible by as many financiers as possible,” said Taylor.

In a nutshell, the platform hashes information necessary for each receivable to be identified as a “digital fingerprint” then shares it across the platform — meaning among the three exchanges — so that duplication can be flagged. For those who know slightly less about financing assets than they do about cryptocurrencies, MonetaGo’s value can be thought of as preventing a double-spend in India’s receivable financing market.

For cases in which the information of an existing invoice is altered to appear new, MonetaGo's network doesn’t block the financing, but it does still alert exchanges so they can perform additional due diligence. MonetaGo doesn't participate itself in the network. Since it’s decentralized across the exchanges, MonetaGo does not control the data: It simply built and maintains the platform.

No Tokens, No Regulators, No Problems
According to Taylor, it’s difficult to say how often this type of fraud happens in India. Exchanges like these have only been operating for about a year. And though this use case of preventing fraud in financing receivables might seem minor compared to the more ambitious blockchain applications that have been conceptualized, Taylor admitted they will continue assessing the financial supply chain for more opportunities.

In the simplest terms, MonetaGo’s regulatory advantage is that they do not use tokens.

“The only purpose of the network is to transfer information between people and ensure the integrity of that data,” said Taylor. MonetaGo’s role is to transfer information among the three competitive exchanges.

He then laid out the fundamental difference between what MonetaGo does versus a blockchain enterprise solution that uses a token:

“A token essentially allows for accounting arithmetic to be performed on a blockchain to maintain value of a particular asset while transferring ownership of it. We [MonetaGo] are not doing that because we are not transferring any value or ownership of anything. We are just transferring information from one party to another — that’s the fundamental difference.”

He went on to explain that although this live deployment lined up just as RBI banned financial entities from dealing with cryptocurrencies, MonetaGo has been working on its blockchain solution platform since 2015. According to Taylor, deploying a tokenless blockchain solution takes significant time and effort, “It’s no mean feat to get a bunch of competitors to agree upon the same technology to use.”",REGULATION,0.9934
2018/4/11,22 European Nations Come Together with Blockchain Partnership,"On April 10, 2018, 22 European countries joined forces to cooperate on blockchain regulation and education.

The European Blockchain Partnership “will be a vehicle for cooperation amongst Member States to exchange experience and expertise in technical and regulatory fields and prepare for the launch of EU-wide blockchain applications across the Digital Single Market for the benefit of the public and private sectors,” states the European Commission press release.

A complete list of the participating countries includes Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the U.K. An invitation to join the partnership has been extended to “other countries, Members of the EU and of the European Economic Area.”

Spearheaded by the European Commission, the partnership wants to ensure that Europe stays at the forefront of blockchain development in the years to come. The press release gives a nod to blockchain technology for “promoting user trust,” and the partnership believes it will play a foundational role in a number of digital services in the future, including logistics, finance and regulatory reporting.

Partner states especially see the potential for blockchain technology to integrate with Europe’s Digital Single Market, a policy initiative that looks to unite Europe’s disparate online markets into one. Like the Digital Single Market, the partnership will try to avoid disjointed approaches to blockchain development among EU and European Economic Area members. It’s the partnership’s hope that cooperation will lead to smooth, cross-country interoperability with blockchain technology “in full compliance with EU laws and with clear governance models that will help services using blockchain [technology] flourish across Europe.”   

The European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society, Mariya Gabriel, sees the partnership as a progressive move that will affect the quality of Europe’s public and technological services for the better.

“In the future, all public services will use blockchain technology. Blockchain is a great opportunity for Europe and Member States to rethink their information systems, to promote user trust and the protection of personal data, to help create new business opportunities and to establish new areas of leadership, benefiting citizens, public services and companies. The Partnership launched today enables Member States to work together with the European Commission to turn the enormous potential of blockchain technology into better services for citizens.”

2018/4/12,Another Major Hong Kong Cryptocurrency Exchange Sets Its Sights on Malta,"A second major Hong Kong–based cryptocurrency exchange is planning on setting up shop in Malta, a small island nation in the Mediterranean.    

OKEx, one of the top five cryptocurrency exchanges by 24-hour trading volume, announced today, April 12, 2018, that it is expanding its operations to Malta. In late March, Binance, the largest exchange by trading volume, also announced plans to move operations to the cryptocurrency-friendly EU member state.

In an email to Bitcoin Magazine, a spokesperson for OKEx clarified, “... everything stays in Hong Kong (all functions) and we are establishing a new entity in Malta in full accordance with the expected Malta regulations and framework. This expansion has no effect on our existing offices and operations in other jurisdictions.”   

OKEx CEO Chris Lee stated: “We look forward to working with the Malta government as it is forward thinking and shares many of our same values: the most important of which are protection of traders and the general public, compliance with Anti Money Laundering and Know Your Customer standards, and recognition of the innovation and importance of continued development in the Blockchain ecosystem.”

OKEx says it has already met with Maltese government and regulatory leaders to get a better understanding of the country’s evolving regulatory plans and provide feedback.

The move further establishes Malta as a growing hub in the cryptocurrency space. Currently, the country is in the process of setting up the Malta Digital Innovation Authority aimed at building a regulatory framework for blockchain technology, and by extension cryptocurrency, in the country.

OKEx and Binance are not the only Hong Kong–based exchanges that are looking to expand outside of Hong Kong. In recent weeks, Bitfinex, another major cryptocurrency exchange, announced it was moving to Switzerland.  

Of all the countries, China has been the most heavy handed toward cryptocurrencies. Starting in September 2017, the People’s Bank of China completely banned initial coin offerings. Later, the country froze bank accounts associated with exchanges and began clamping down on bitcoin miners. In February 2018, it began taking measures to cut off one of the few remaining avenues for its citizens to buy cryptocurrencies.  

Governed under the principal of “one country, two systems,” Hong Kong is both China and not China. The city reverted back to Chinese rule in 1997 under an agreement that Hong Kong would remain autonomous but that China would evaluate and revise the relationship moving forward. Since then, China has been slowly encroaching on Hong Kong’s sovereignty. Thus, businesses that choose to operate in Hong Kong could risk complications in the future if their models are banned in China, though still legitimate (for now) in Hong Kong.",REGULATION,-0.0231
2018/4/16,"When the Taxman Comes Knocking, Will Americans Report Crypto Gains?","Cryptocurrency investors appear to be skirting their taxes. Whether keeping with crypto’s anti-establishment roots or for lack of ability, American cryptocurrency practitioners are testing the IRS’s tolerance for crypto tax evasion.

Tax day in the United States is tomorrow, April 17, 2018, but according to the popular tax filing service Credit Karma, few cryptocurrency holders have reported earnings or losses on their 2017 tax documents. Out of the company’s 250,000 new filings, under 100 have disclosed capital gains from cryptocurrency investments, figures that are in line with the company’s former reports on cryptocurrency tax documentation.

Certainly, Credit Karma’s user base does not constitute the whole of America’s crypto investor populace. But it could reflect the demographic’s general resistance to paying taxes on their investments, and this could have something to do with the IRS’s policy.

In 2014, the IRS released an official notice regarding its cryptocurrency tax policy. First and foremost, the IRS treats virtual currencies as property, subjecting them to the same capital gains taxes that affect traditional investments like stocks, bonds and real estate. These taxes are applicable to anyone who has received payment for goods and/or services in crypto (as part of a salary, for instance), as well as miners, who must account for gains as part of their income.

The tax code appears straightforward enough, but uncertainty remains. Given that the IRS treats any trade as a taxable event and the onus of reporting rests on the investor, reporting on cryptocurrency investments can seem confusing and convoluted to those untrained in accounting and finance.

“Even with the tax deadline rapidly approaching in the U.S., we’re still seeing lots of people unsure about the proper way to prepare cryptocurrency taxes. Properly accounting for crypto-to-crypto trades, trading on multiple exchanges, and purchases made with cryptocurrency can be an overwhelming task,” Chris Kovalik, founder of Cointaxes, told Bitcoin Magazine.

Kovalik finds that the IRS’s policy places “the burden … on the taxpayer to follow and account for the government’s guidance when filing taxes.” Unlike other tax codes that offer standards and historical precedent, crypto investors have no touchstone for guidance.

According to the Los Angeles Times, the IRS has suggested that taxpayers review “factual scenarios that most closely resemble their circumstances” to seek such guidance, something David Klasing, a tax and accountant lawyer, told the Times amounts to “basically just telling practitioners to take a wild-ass guess.”

And this guess could look to answer questions that stem from a variety of scenarios. Along with crypto-to-crypto trades, “[many] people may simply not know that the IRS has stated that spending crypto is a taxable event, akin to a barter transaction,” Jon Brose, an attorney for Seward & Kissel’s Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Group, told Bitcoin Magazine. This means that day-to-day purchases with bitcoin and other currencies are subject to capital gains taxes.

As the market matures, there are gray areas still. For example, the advent of airdrops and hard forks for cryptocurrency dispersal means investors will likely have to wrestle with reporting these earnings in their income, as well.

As we look down the barrel of America’s first cryptocurrency tax season, early adopters and veteran enthusiasts will likely bear the taxman’s heaviest brunt, as they likely have years of previously unreported gains to follow up on. Depending on the size of their stash, these individuals could be some of the 13,000 users Coinbase was legally obligated to report to the IRS back in February.

These account records are likely to belong to those who have realized great profits from their original investments, not your run-of-the-mill investor. Brose believes that the average investor probably doesn’t think to report gains since “the practical problem of tracking which cryptos you have spent or sold” becomes too much of a hassle for reporting a modest portfolio. He also finds that “individuals that are spending crypto frequently on relatively small items may think that it doesn’t make a lot of sense to declare a taxable event every time they buy a cup of coffee.”

Given that formal guidance is nebulous and the IRS’s ability to enforce their policy is yet to be seen, cryptocurrency investors may be inclined to take calculated risks that have become commonplace in such a volatile market.  

But if the IRS wants investors to work with them in the future, things will have to change, Brose argues.  

“To ensure greater compliance, the IRS ought to make rules for cryptocurrencies that conform to the way crypto actually works and is used, so that taxpayers can accurately compute their tax liabilities arising from crypto transactions.”

Until that time, investors must either navigate their filing themselves, seek help from an accountant or taxation service, or hope their portfolios will fly under the IRS’s radar.",REGULATION,0.34
2018/4/18,Telegram’s Pavel Durov Is Using Bitcoin to Bypass Russian Sanctions,"Telegram CEO Pavel Durov is battling against Russian security forces, after they implemented a block on Monday, April 16, 2018, on the messaging app when it refused a court order to “grant state security services access to its users’ encrypted messages,” according to Reuters.

The move was initiated by Alexander Zharov, head of the Russian watchdog organization Roskomnadzor, who has blocked 18 sub-networks and various IP addresses belonging to both Amazon and Google in the process.

“We have currently informed both companies that a significant number of IP addresses located in the clouds of these two services have fallen under the block due to the court ruling,” Zharov commented. He further stated that Telegram has potentially been used by terrorists to “coordinate attacks” on both Russia and its neighbors.

But as the skies darken and defense seems like a lost cause, Durov is refusing to give up, as Telegram customers received the following notification early this morning:

“For the last 24 hours Telegram has been under a ban by internet providers in Russia. The reason is our refusal to provide encryption keys to Russian security agencies. For us, this was an easy decision. We promised our users 100% privacy and would rather cease to exist than violate this promise.”

Durov has since taken to his account on VK — a Russian social network — to explain that he is offering bitcoin grants to both companies and individuals alike that run proxy servers and virtual private networks (VPNs). He says he’s “happy to donate millions of dollars” from his personal stash to illustrate and assist this cause, noting that both VPNs and proxy servers work against the hindrances set in place by Russian authorities.

Proxy servers operate by acting as connective tissue between clients and other servers. Normally, these clients seek information or resources from outside servers and thus link to a proxy server, which decides the best way to simplify and control the complexity of their incoming data. In addition, proxy servers offer anonymity to their users, and can be utilized to bypass blocks on certain IP addresses.

A VPN extends a private network across a public one and allows users to send and receive information without disclosing their identities. According to Durov, both systems require third-party funding, and he’s urging players with money to get in on the game alongside him.

As the last 24 hours have shown, in their ongoing war on progress, Russia’s supervisory authorities are willing to block millions of IP addresses of cloud hosting without regard for losses of extraneous projects.

While Russia only accounts for 7 percent of Telegram’s users, Durov called the recent ban “unconstitutional” and commented that threats to privacy and principles are more important than the numbers.

“Even if we lose the entire [Russian market], Telegram’s organic growth in other regions will compensate for this loss within a couple months,” Durov mentioned. “However, it is important for me personally to make sure we do everything we can for our Russian users.”",REGULATION,-0.8952
2018/4/20,“Venture Capital Working Group” Seeks Select Cryptocurrency “Safe Harbor”,"Several venture capitalists (VCs) and entrepreneurs have been petitioning federal authorities to see certain virtual currencies in a “different light.”

Right now, many cryptocurrencies are in danger of being classified as “securities,” which would place them under strict regulatory scrutiny. Working to change this, venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures have gathered a team of lawyers and investors known as the “Venture Capital Working Group” to meet with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to develop what they call a “safe harbor” for specific digital currencies and establish long-term proposals for how they should be viewed and handled.

The New York Times alleges that several regulators are considering placing well-known cryptocurrencies — including ether, the world’s second-largest digital asset — in the securities category, which may cause their prices to fall drastically.

Richard Levin, a lawyer who’s worked with various blockchain and cryptocurrency ventures, described the meeting as “crucial” to the safety of digital assets and their respective users.

“It’s a ‘come to the lord’ moment,” he explained. “We are seeing a watershed moment in which many firms in the digital asset community who may have been ignorant of the law — or poorly informed — are now coming to terms with the fact that they are subject to regulators.”

While details surrounding the meeting remain largely confidential, the group says it’s trying to garner “utility token” classifications for many specific cryptocurrencies.

Many virtual entities have been introduced through initial coin offerings (ICOs). The process involves a team of entrepreneurs selling these virtual assets to raise funds for future projects. Generally, these currencies work as “internal payment methods” in the software the entrepreneurs create.

For a coin to classify as a security, users who buy it must have the opportunity to transform money into capital and garner profit by owning the asset without taking physical possession of it.

Securities are typically designed to be “shares” or stakes in a company, while utility tokens represent “access to [a] company’s product or service.” In bearing more practical uses, utility tokens are usually exempt from securities regulations.

Since 2017, over $6 billion in revenue have been generated through initial coin offerings, and most trade via unregulated exchange platforms. Many investors claim that these coins, in serving as payment methods, carry utilities, and should not be classified as securities or investment contracts.

But Jay Clayton — chairman of the SEC — disagrees, and believes every token offered through an ICO should be officially “registered as a security.” Very few are, and the SEC has sent dozens of subpoenas to both individuals and ventures involved in cryptocurrency, requesting data regarding how certain digital assets were marketed or issued.

Investments that fall into the securities category must have paperwork filed with registered exchanges. For the most part, entities like bitcoin, litecoin and monero can’t be placed here, as they were not originally distributed through ICOs. Furthermore, new coins are given daily to computers that work to extract them and maintain current networks.

While ether now follows a similar pattern, the coin is still in danger, primarily due to Ethereum’s past of garnering funds through ether token “presales” — events now classified as ICOs. The Venture Capital Working Group is arguing that ether “has become so decentralized,” it should not be labeled as a security, and that should it ever achieve “full decentralization,” it must be exempt from all future securities laws.

The group says it has the support of many “key players” in the digital currency and blockchain arena. Nevertheless, regulators have been slow to accept the proposal, and at press time, it is unclear what results will arise. Bitcoin Magazine will provide further updates on this story as they occur.",REGULATION,0.9873
2018/4/20,Cofounder’s FINRA Suspension Could Hold Consequences for Tezos,"When Arthur Breitman, cofounder of Tezos, published a white paper on the cryptocurrency project in September 2014, he listed the author as L.M. Goodman. Later, when Breitman disclosed that he was the real author behind the work, many wondered why he used a pseudonym.

As it turned out, at the same time he began working on Tezos, a project that went on to raise $232 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) in July 2017, Breitman was working at investment bank Morgan Stanley. He was also registered as a broker-dealer with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a self-regulatory body with oversight of dealers and brokers in the U.S.

FINRA requires registered securities professionals to let their employers know about any for-profit business they are conducting on the sidelines. Breitman, who left Morgan Stanley in 2016 and is no longer registered with FINRA, neglected to inform his employer about Tezos, and the fact he used a pseudonym on the white paper indicates he may have been trying to conceal his involvement.

These and other details of the Tezos project were brought to light in October 2017, when Reuters published a full report on the project, thereby putting Tezos on the radar of regulatory bodies, such as FINRA and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Now, according to an April 19, 2018, report by Reuters, as part of an April 18, 2018, settlement, FINRA has fined Breitmen $20,000 and suspended him from associating with broker-dealers for two years over allegations that he made false statements about the Tezos project during his time at Morgan Stanley.

The question is, how big a deal are these punishments, and will they have any impact going forward on the Tezos project, which has yet to launch?

Relatively Small Fine
FINRA and SEC fines are not uncommon. Anyone who checks the broker records of institutions like RBC, Vanguard and Bank of America, where people in the U.S. and Canada place their money, will see that these financial firms all have dings against them, and, just as Breitman did, most individuals settle by either not confirming or denying the charges.

A look at FINRA’s monthly rundown of disciplinary actions makes it clear that Breitman’s fine of $20,000 is on the low end. Many more of the fines are in the range of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars. In comparison, this fine appears to be nothing more than a minor slap on the wrist.

More notable is the fact that Breitman was barred from the securities industry for two years. Few people are barred from the securities industry for any length of time, and two years is an upper limit, according to FINRA’s sanction guidelines, which state that “absent extraordinary circumstances, any misconduct so serious as to merit a suspension of more than two years probably should warrant a bar (of an individual) or expulsion (of a member firm) from the securities industry.”  

Potential Roadblocks
As spelled out in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a broker-dealer is a person or a company that is in the business of buying and selling securities, for its own account or on behalf of its customers or both. The ban essentially means that for the next two years, Breitman cannot associate with any company that is in the business of buying or selling securities, unless he gets a special waiver. Even with a special waiver, he still would not be able to associate directly with the business aspects (deals, committee meetings, financial activities, etc.) of a securities-related company.

If the Tezos tokens, known as “tezzies,” are deemed securities, this may pose a problem for Tezos down the road. Earlier this year, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton stated that all ICO tokens were securities. If the SEC issues a ruling to that effect, then all ICO projects would have to register with the SEC. (Note that some venture capitalists are currently lobbying for exemptions that would allow some tokens to be categorized as “utility tokens” rather than securities.)

The upshot is, having been suspended by the industry, eventually Breitman may have to distance himself from the Tezos project. Robert Hockett, Edward Cornell Professor of Law at Cornell Law School, told Bitcoin Magazine that if the SEC deems Tezos a securities business, the project “will not be allowed to be associated with [Breitman] in any way.”

Of note, Tezos actually consists of two entities: Tezos Foundation, a Zug-based nonprofit that oversaw the Tezos ICO; and Dynamic Ledger Solutions (DLS), a Delaware-based company under the control of Breitman and his wife, Kathleen Breitman, that owns and oversees the development of the Tezos software. Although the two entities are separate, they are also connected; for instance, the Breitmans went after the Tezos Foundation last year to get its then-president deposed. DLS was not directly associated with the ICO, but DLS is shown to be profiting off the buying and selling of securities, then Breitman may be restricted from actively participating in any of the business.

“The securities laws and the SEC define ‘affiliation’ broadly for these purposes,” said Hockett.  

In a statement to Reuters, Sarah Lightdale, an attorney for Breitman, played down the settlement. “The settlement with FINRA is unrelated to and has no impact on the launch of the Tezos network,” she said. Then added, “Arthur cooperated fully with FINRA at all times and Arthur is pleased to put this personal matter behind him.”",REGULATION,0.9724
2018/4/23,"WikiLeaks Store Loses Coinbase Support, Still Processing Sales","WikiLeaks has had to find alternative solutions for its online shop. On April 20, 2018, the whistle-blowing document depository revealed in a tweet that Coinbase has shut down the WikiLeaks’ online store account.

Even with  Coinbase out as a payment processor, WikiLeaks’ online shop is still able to use  CoinPayments.net for cryptocurrency payments, accepting both bitcoin and a variety of altcoins. The organization also still accepts donations in bitcoin, litecoin, ether, monero and zcash.

Coinbase Bails on WikiLeaks
The organization claims that Coinbase sent them a memo “without notice or explanation” indicating that it would no longer have access to the platform.

“Upon careful review,” the message reads, “we believe your account has engaged in prohibited use in violation of our Terms of Service and we regret to inform you that we can no longer provide you with access to our service. We respectfully request that you follow the on-screen instructions presented when you log into your Coinbase account to send any remaining balance offsite to an external address.”

In the message, Coinbase points out that it “is a regulated Money Services Business under FinCEN (FinCen.gov),” making it “legally obligated to implement regulatory compliance mechanisms.” However, the exchange offers no further details on what regulations or Terms of Service WikiLeaks violated to invite a ban. Responding to the developments, WikiLeaks tweeted that it will call for an international boycott of Coinbase next week, calling out the exchange “as an unfit member of the crypto community.”

Ironically, WikiLeaks began funding its organization with cryptocurrencies after banks and payment services stopped processing donations to it in November 2010. As Visa, Mastercard, Bank of America, PayPal and Western Union shuttered their support, the renegade group turned to virtual currencies that better conformed to its cypherpunk, anarchist roots.  

By December 2016, WikiLeaks had raised 4,000 bitcoin worth roughly $3,000,000 at the time.  The flooding of funding was enough to keep WikiLeaks afloat during the blockade, and as Andreas Antonopoulos points out, “Coinbase has repeated history” by effecting the same ban that sparked “many people’s interest in bitcoin.” ANNOUNCE: Coinbase has blocked the official @WikiLeaks shop from its platform without notice or explanation. You can continue to donate #Bitcoin to WikiLeaks at https://WikiLeaks.org/donate . #Coinbase #DefendWL #Cryptocurrency #Ethereum #BitcoinCash #ReconnectJulian. We have come full circle. Many people's interest in bitcoin started when Wikileaks was out under an extra judicial embargo by VISA, MC, PayPal and banks. Now Coinbase has repeated history. Oops.",REGULATION,-0.4215
2018/4/26,Regulatory Clarity Should Lead to More Capital Investment in Crypto: Panel,"The Distributed Markets conference took place in Chicago on April 23, 2018, and featured an array of blockchain and financial experts working to shed light on opportunities and changes happening in the cryptocurrency space.

Among the main goals of the conference was to educate attendees on how they could integrate blockchain technology into their businesses, thereby increasing cost-effectiveness and overall efficiency. A Blockchain Academy workshop and a hackathon were also available to give developers and entrepreneurs a chance to study blockchain macro cases and showcase their skills.

In a panel moderated by Joseph Bradley, entitled “Crypto Regulation: Striking a Balance Between Compliance and Growth,” speakers Colleen Sullivan of CMT Digital; Illinois state regulator Sean T. O’Kelly; Haimera Workie, senior director of FINRA’s Office of Emerging Regulatory Issues; and Tennessee blockchain lawyer J. Gray Sasser of Frost Brown Todd addressed the topic of regulation.

Perhaps the biggest issues hitting the crypto arena are regulation, and how tokens and virtual assets should be classified. The Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), for example, has jurisdiction over commodities like bitcoin and lists bitcoin futures on regulated interest exchanges.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), however, which works to regulate securities and all derivatives of securities, is now seeking to label all tokens distributed through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) as such, which could subject them to strict regulatory tactics that could seriously decrease their values. The SEC has since issued several subpoenas to virtual asset enterprises to better understand how certain tokens have been issued and marketed.

Sullivan was quick to tackle this issue. “All securities have to be traded on registered securities exchanges in the United States,” she told the audience.

She explained that the SEC first weighed in on cryptocurrencies in July of 2017, when it released an investigative report on the DAO, stating that certain tokens fell under the “securities” category per specific regulations. Presently, there are over 1,500 separate virtual tokens, and none are traded through securities exchanges the way they should be, as suggested by SEC standards.

Sasser also offered his insight, suggesting that if a token is pre-sold or offered through an ICO, it should technically qualify as a security unless it meets a certain level of functionality.

One of the primary arguments among those who stand against tokens classifying as securities is that they are used as payment methods by those investing in new coins, and, therefore, qualify as “utility tokens” due to their practical nature. Thus far, the SEC has been hesitant to accept this viewpoint.

Sasser said the issue and the industry itself is clouded with uncertainty.

“I’ve been doing these panels for a long time, and usually, my first answer to a lot of these kinds of questions is ‘I don’t know,’” he joked.

For the most part, Sasser believes the SEC has been clear in stating where tokens should fall, though they’ve failed to guide distributors along the way.

Sullivan further mentioned that states follow separate rules when it comes to governing cryptocurrency activity. Illinois, for example, has long refused to recognize cryptocurrencies as valid means of money transmission, but, according to fellow speaker O’Kelly, state regulators are beginning to reverse their overall views and are now attempting to attract blockchain startups and build Illinois as a possible tech hub.

Discussing “regulatory gaps” in the crypto arena, Sullivan explained that CFTC Commissioner Brian B. Quintenz is calling for the industry to “self-regulate,” as Congress has not yet taken the reins. She said that Quintenz is asking that blockchain and cryptocurrency leaders impose a self-regulatory organization that can enforce strict standards for other industry members to follow.

Sullivan mentioned that steps toward such an association have already begun, with a recent example coming from Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss of New York’s Gemini Exchange. They have proposed a Virtual Commodities Association, an industry-sponsored, self-regulatory organization for the U.S. virtual currency industry, which will set forth practical standards regarding how an exchange should be officiated, among other goals.

Sullivan believes Congress will eventually get involved, but suggested that maneuvers like these could cover the main ground until then.

In the meantime, the blockchain is presenting several new opportunities for recording data. O’Kelly, who says the government will always be indirectly involved in the verification process of blockchain transactions, says state representatives were recently approached by an organization that wanted to track the entire life of a car on the blockchain, including the change of owners along the way. That change of title would entail government-based authorization.

Sullivan concluded the discussion by explaining that, while the crypto market lacks solid regulation, the influx of institutional capital entering the space should eventually lead to a prime broker’s presence, thus paving the way to further stability and efficiency.

“I think as the regulatory environment becomes more clear in the next 12 months, we’re going to see a lot more capital,” she explained. “Right now, most changes in the industry have applied to retail.”",REGULATION,0.4019
2018/4/27,Latest SEC Hearing into Cryptocurrencies Offers Glimmer of Light,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been relatively stringent in its views of both security and utility tokens. The organization is seeking to label all virtual tokens originally distributed through initial coin offerings (ICOs) as securities, which would subject them to very strict regulatory practices and potentially have massive repercussions on their prices.

One of those tokens is ether, which was originally distributed and marketed through presales. Members of the Venture Capital Working Group — an organization comprised of lawyers, investors and cryptocurrency experts working to block the SEC’s decision — argue that ether has become so decentralized, it can no longer be looked at as a security, and should thus be exempt from securities-related laws. Ether is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap after bitcoin.

April 26, 2018, marked an important step in the fight for “token rights.” A congressional hearing with testimony from the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance (the organization directly responsible for establishing token policies) took place to potentially develop more reasonable approaches toward token sales and their classifications.

Minnesota Representative Tom Emmer led the discussion with SEC division head William Hinman. Throughout the hearing, Emmer voiced his support for cryptocurrency entrepreneurship and innovation, stating, “People tend to fear what they don’t know. If people sailing the oceans at the time of Columbus had believed the world is flat, we wouldn’t have had the great discoveries of the New World.”

The discussion marks a new attitude amongst SEC members. Chairman Jay Clayton has reported in the past that he wants to see all tokens registered through ICOs be classified as securities in the future, but Hinman assured listeners that representatives are trying to view the situation openly and see which entities might exhibit utility-based behaviors.

During the hearing, Rep. Emmer asked Hinman, “Is it possible that a utility token would not be a security because it’s not done for capital formation?”

Hinman replied that it ultimately was possible, as there are tokens that do not have the “hallmarks” of a security. Additionally, he stated that many fundraisers are intended to “develop networks” where a token is strictly intended for use as a buying mechanism for goods or services.

“We can certainly imagine a token where the holder is buying a token for its utility, not as an investment,” Hinman continued. “Especially if it’s a decentralized network where it’s used, and not central actors where there would be information asymmetries where they would know more than token investors.”

In a recent panel discussion during the Distributed: Markets Conference in Chicago, Tennessee blockchain lawyer Gray Sasser of Frost Brown Todd explained that while the SEC has been relatively straightforward in saying where tokens should fall, it has not done a good job of guiding distributors or token builders.

This has been a recurring point of concern. Emmer echoed this sentiment, asking how regulation in the U.S. can be better clarified for U.S. investors. He queried whether it was possible to assist crypto-related business developers to better understand their contributions to tokens that may not be securities, thus avoiding SEC enforcements.

Hinman — likely referring to the Venture Capital Working Group — replied that one of the steps the SEC was taking was “meeting with participants that have these ideas of a token that shouldn’t be regulated as a security” and working with them on how they should be structured. Hinman pointed out that the SEC is heavily engaged in academics, industry and other departments to better explore how everything might work, and that in the long run, the U.S. is “pragmatic” in its support of new technology.

Unfortunately, the hearing also shed light on the lack of education among American leaders concerning cryptocurrencies. Some comments and questions arose, for example, that referenced bitcoin as a security despite the asset already being established as a commodity by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

Figures like Aaron Wright — director of blockchain project Cardozo — took to Twitter to express their thoughts and concerns. Wright says that the hearing was amongst the most significant and fulsome commentaries delivered by the SEC regarding token regulation, but that there was also “superficial appeal” to treating bitcoin and related tokens as securities, as many of them are still seen as “speculative assets.”

“I hope that we don’t [go] down that path,” he wrote. “These types of arguments could conceivably gain legs, given the heavy emphasis by some that tokens in some way mutate. Certain tokens could start as a commodity and then mutate into securities as networks consolidate and begin to exhibit less utility. There’s no logical boundaries for these types of arguments so they become dangerous and likely will have unforeseen consequences.”

On the other hand, nonprofit research and advocacy association Coin Center was very positive about the hearing, commenting that the SEC’s views were generally the “right approach” when it came to examining tokens’ usefulness and decentralization to decide whether tokens were securities or utilities.

“It’s awesome to hear the SEC’S Director of Corporation Finance testify that they are looking at these issues with a similar perspective,” said Peter Van Valkenburgh, the organization’s director of research, on the Coin Center blog.",REGULATION,0.9955
2018/5/9,DMG Blockchain Solutions Launches BitScore AML Risk API for Crypto Exchanges and Payment Platforms,"Vancouver-based blockchain and cryptocurrency firm DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc. has announced the official launch of its BitScore web API. The platform is designed to provide cryptocurrency deposit and withdrawal risk-scoring for both anti-money laundering (AML) and anti-fraud compliance.

DMG Blockchain Solutions seeks to manage, operate and develop end-to-end solutions for monetizing the blockchain ecosystem, and BitScore is already being used by crypto exchanges and enterprise payment platforms so they can assess their risks of legal non-compliance. BitScore was engineered by DMG’s Blockseer development team and is powered by sophisticated artificial intelligence and machine learning models to examine the flow of cryptocurrency funds through the blockchain and establish their respective origins.

Speaking with Bitcoin Magazine, DMG CTO Danny Yang explained, “Understanding the provenance of source and destination addresses is imperative for any exchange or payment platform sensitive to regulatory compliance. Allowing an address that accepts deposits from, or makes payments or deposits to disreputable networks is potentially abetting their activities, which creates legal liabilities for banks, exchanges and traders.”

Here’s how it all works. Customers can submit any cryptocurrency source or destination address to BitScore. The platform’s algorithm returns a risk score to the user after evaluating the source of the funds. Customers are also informed if at any time in the past the monitored address has ever sent funds to high-risk parties. These typically include dark markets, hacking sites or money-laundering services.

BitScore also examines several generations of transactions in both directions (receiving and sending) and applies a weighting function that determines the amount of questionable cryptocurrency flowing through studied transactions. At press time, BitScore supports bitcoin only, though it plans to add ether and ERC20 tokens this coming summer. Litecoin and bitcoin cash will be added by the end of 2018.

BitScore is not the first effort of its kind. As regulatory compliance for cryptocurrency platforms becomes more crucial, several ventures involved in the blockchain arena are working to implement changes to their operations to certify rules are followed, customer safety is intact and monetary authorities remain satisfied.

One such company — cryptocurrency exchange platform Vaultbank — recently entered a partnership with Gordian Compliance Solutions to guarantee AML and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) compliance.

COO Aaron Travis stated, “If you’re on an exchange, or buying digital assets in which the originator or person selling them to you has not gone through great efforts to get to know you, and [has not] undergone KYC and AML checks, then I would be wary of it. If the platform you’re buying a digital currency from is not going through those hoops — those standard, basic efforts to protect the investor — you need to be wary of that.”

Other companies —  like Coinfirm, a risk and compliance platform designed predominantly for cryptocurrency businesses — have also released APIs built for further customer security and AML protection.",REGULATION,0.694
2018/5/11,How Japan Is Creating a Template for Cryptocurrency Regulation,"Some countries in Asia are feeling the pain of inadequate cryptocurrency regulation, while others, like India, China and South Korea, have taken an uncertain or hostile stance to cryptocurrency. In contrast, Japan is building a clear framework for how virtual currency exchanges, and soon initial coin offerings (ICOs), should operate there. In doing so, Japan is becoming a hotspot for virtual currency exchanges that can afford to comply with its strict rules, while also creating a regulatory template for the rest of Asia to follow.  

Japan has always been friendly to cryptocurrency, but it took an early hit in 2014 when Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox became the target of the largest bitcoin hack ever. The exchange was handling 70 percent of all of the bitcoin transactions in the world when, after a series of messy complications, it abruptly stopped trading in February 2014. Following that, 650,000 bitcoin worth $390 million at the time (or $6 billion at today’s value) were reported missing.

In response to the massive virtual currency heist, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the Paris-based international body that creates policies to combat money laundering, issued its “Guidance of Risk-Based Approach to Cryptocurrencies” in 2015. The 46-page report recommends that countries license virtual currency exchanges and subject them to the same rules and oversight as any other financial institution or money transmitting business.

New Laws, Big Changes
Prompted by a desire to protect consumers and the FATF’s recommendations, Japan revised its Payment Services Act. The new law, which went into effect in April 2017, does two things. First, it legally defines virtual currency as a form of payment. (Japan still does not define bitcoin as legal tender, but acknowledges that you can use it to purchase things with.) Second, the law requires any virtual currency exchange that wants to do business in Japan or solicit its citizens to register with the country’s Financial Services Agency (FSA).  

Because existing exchanges needed time to bring their operations up to date with the new standards, the FSA gave all exchanges that were in operation before the law went into effect a six-month grace period to apply for a license. Any exchange that applied for a license within that period was allowed to continue operating for an indeterminate period of time while their application was still pending. These exchanges fall under a special category of “quasi-operators,” meaning they are not fully licensed operators, just somewhere in between.

Under the new law, virtual currency exchanges in Japan are now required to be accountable to their customers. They have to keep customer assets separate from the assets of the exchange, maintain proper bookkeeping, undergo annual audits, file business reports and comply with strict know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering rules, and more.

First Licensed Exchanges
Registering as an exchange in Japan is a long, involved process that can take up to six months. The FSA licensed the first 11 exchanges in September 2017. In early December 2017, it licensed another four, and at the end of December 2017, it licensed the 16th exchange. At that time, 16 quasi-operators still had applications pending and were in the process of upgrading their internal operations. Then, in late January 2018, disaster struck. Coincheck, one of the quasi-operators, was hacked, resulting in the loss of $530 million worth of NEM tokens.

The Coincheck theft prompted heavier oversight. The FSA began conducting on-the-spot inspections for all quasi-operators to look for security gaps, and in March 2018, the FSA sent out punishment notices to seven exchanges, even requiring two to halt operations for 30 days.

According to Asia News Network, the FSA is grappling with how to handle its quasi-operators. Shutting unqualified operators down too quickly could cause customer backlash, but, at the same time, the FSA needs to make sure the proper security checks are in place.

Japan’s plan is to pass on part of the work of overseeing virtual currency exchanges to a self-regulating body (SRO) that functions similarly to how the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) works in the U.S.

To that end, in April 2018, the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Industry Association launched. The new group, comprised of the first 16 licensed Japanese virtual currency exchanges, will have the power to create and enforce rules and set fines, and eventually develop standards for ICOs.

Legalizing ICOs
After tackling virtual currency exchanges, Japan is now moving on to the ICO market. The process began in October 2017 when the FSA issued a statement warning investors about the volatility of ICO tokens and the risk for fraud. In that statement, the FSA also clarified that, depending on how an ICO is structured (and whether its token has the characteristics of virtual currency or an investment), it may fall within the scope of the Payment Services Act or the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.

In April 2018, the Center for Rule-Making Strategies at Tama University released a list of guidelines for regulating ICOs. The government-backed report states that ICO projects should clearly spell out how they plan to distribute funds. It also outlines rules for tracking the progress of a project, confirming the identity of buyers and restricting insider trading. According to Bloomberg, the proposal will be deliberated by Japan’s FSA and could become law in a few years.

Japan is still fine-tuning oversight of its virtual currency exchanges, and its ICO framework may take a few more years to develop. But, by putting clarity around an industry that has long operated with little or no oversight, Japan is setting the stage for a future when cryptocurrencies will play a larger role in society.",REGULATION,0.296
2018/5/22,CFTC Publishes New Advisory to Clarify Crypto Futures Trading,"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) — the United States’ top-ranking derivatives regulator — has published an advisory providing further guidance to both clearinghouses and exchanges seeking to list cryptocurrencies on their platforms. The cryptocurrency space has been riddled with concerns about the vetting process for contracts, like bitcoin futures, and the CFTC is looking to clear the air.

Staff members have issued the following statement:

“Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC” or “Commission”) staff believes it is important to encourage innovation and growth in these products, but within an appropriate oversight framework that enables exchanges and clearinghouses to operate within the confines of the core principles. To this end, Commission staff continues to monitor developments in these products and discuss the risks and challenges they present with industry and market participants.”

The CFTC says it’s focusing on the latest “best practices” for launching cryptocurrency derivative contracts, saying that exchanges should be able to monitor “underlying cryptocurrency spot markets” and coordinate with federal regulators. They should also be allowed to contact market participants and request comments regarding pending contract launches.

Division of Clearing and Risk Director Brian Bussey mentioned, “CFTC staff is providing this information, in part, to aid market participants in their efforts to design risk management programs that address the new risks imposed by virtual currency products. In addition, the guidance is designed to help ensure that market participants follow appropriate governance processes with respect to the launch of these products.”

While the advisory is not considered a final “compliance checklist,” it does offer insight pertaining to current CFTC expectations and aims to assist both clearinghouses and exchanges in keeping up with changes in the crypto market. The guidance provided in the report includes enhanced market surveillance, large trader reporting, outreach to stakeholders and derivatives clearing organization (DCO) risk management.

Both CME Group and Cboe Global Markets were among the first trading platforms to launch bitcoin futures contracts in December 2017. At the time, both companies had consulted with the CFTC on a strictly limited basis. Bitcoin’s volatile nature and price swings caused many Wall Street players — including the Futures Industry Association — to request that the CFTC further examine virtual currency derivatives before allowing them to be traded.

Thus far, bitcoin futures have behaved as few new contracts have, and their liquidity continues to grow through limited means. However, a study conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco ultimately discovered that the release of bitcoin futures led to the steep drop in cryptocurrency prices last January by allowing “pessimists” to enter the game.

The CFTC has been in control of bitcoin activity since 2015 through the Commodity Exchange Act. The organization has worked extensively to rid the cryptocurrency space of unregistered futures exchanges and protect consumers from fraud, manipulation and illicit practices.",REGULATION,-0.2144
2018/5/31,Op Ed: Five Things Blockchain Firms Need to Know About the GDPR,"This year, we’re witnessing the convergence, and perhaps the collision, of two powerful new forces in data privacy: the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the emergence of blockchain-based privacy solutions. As blockchain technology firms continue to build new solutions, here are five key takeaways they should keep in mind about the GDPR.

Personal Data
The GDPR applies to “personal data,” which is defined as “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’).” A “data subject” is a “natural person … who can be identified … by reference to an identifier … specific to the … cultural or social identity of that natural person.” Moreover, personal data explicitly includes “online identifier[s],” including IP addresses.

Takeaway #1: Essentially, almost any piece of data that can assist in learning something about someone is likely to be considered personal data.

Under the GDPR, personal data even includes data that has undergone “pseudonymization,” meaning that the data has been processed such that it “can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information.” Encryption is considered to be a highly effective means of pseudonymization, and “public keys” on a blockchain which are associated with off-chain personal data are also likely to be considered “pseudonymized.” While the GDPR prefers encrypting data to achieve pseudonymization, that encryption alone does not remove the underlying data from the definition of personal data and, therefore, does not serve to avoid GDPR requirements.

Takeaway #2: If personal data stored off-chain can easily be connected to a public key used in a blockchain solution, the public key is very likely to be considered data that has achieved a state of pseudonymization but is still regulated as personal data subject to the GDPR.

Where personal data has been pseudonymized and the additional information needed to attribute the data to a natural person is “not available,” the GDPR indicates that the data may be considered “anonymous information” or “rendered anonymous.” Because the GDPR only regulates personal data, anything considered anonymous is thus exempt from the GDPR, which “does not … concern the processing of such anonymous information ….”

This provision suggests a path to conform blockchain solutions with the GDPR: If the blockchain architecture is designed such that public keys fit within the definition of anonymous information — by ensuring that any off-chain personal data is securely encrypted, and decryption is not available to permit re-association with the public key — processing of public keys may be exempt from the GDPR’s requirements, including the right of erasure.

Takeaway #3: Preserving the ability to have public keys deemed anonymous under the GDPR is arguably the most critical issue of concern for any company leveraging blockchain technology and dealing with personal data.

Controller vs. Processor
Entities subject to the GDPR have different obligations based on whether they are deemed a “Controller” or a “Processor” of personal data. In general, a Controller “determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data,” while a Processor “processes personal data on behalf of the controller.”

The determination of whether an entity acts as a Controller or a Processor is activity-specific, not entity-specific. This means that, in different contexts, the same entity may be deemed a Controller, a Processor, or both a Controller and Processor. Controllers, as the entities determining the means and purposes of the processing, have significantly more obligations under the GDPR than do Processors. Most importantly, Controllers have the responsibility for implementing requests from individuals who want their personal data deleted, amended or transferred.

Takeaway #4: Companies leveraging blockchain technology should design their systems so that they avoid determining how and why data is processed, and thus avoid being deemed a data Controller.

The Rights of Data Subjects and the Lawful Basis of Processing Data
The GDPR gives data subjects various rights with respect to Controllers of their data. Chief among these are the rights to data portability (i.e., the right to take your data with you), rectification (i.e., the right to amend any incorrect data) and erasure (i.e., the right to be forgotten). In general, these rights can be exercised at the request of the data subject, although there are exceptions to some rights in certain cases, such as when the data is being processed or retained pursuant to a legal obligation.

The obligations of data Controllers to facilitate data subjects’ rights vary based on the lawful basis under which the data is processed. The processing of EU personal data must be supported by one of six legal bases, according to the purpose of the processing. These bases are:

Consent. Consent by the data subject to one or more specific purposes.
Contract. Necessary for the performance of a contract.
Legal Obligation. Necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the data Controller is subject.
Public Interest. Necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.
Vital Interests. Necessary for the protection of the vital interests of the data subject.
Legitimate Interests. Necessary for the legitimate interests of the Controller or a third party, unless overridden by the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject.
Because consent may be withdrawn at any time, requiring deletion of any personal data collected on the basis of that consent, it is not an advisable or reliable basis for processing personal data that will be entered onto a blockchain. Similarly, while personal data may be collected and processed pursuant to the performance of a contract, if that contract is terminated or expires, the lawful basis for processing ends and the data must be deleted. On the other hand, data collected to comply with a legal obligation is likely exempt from the right of erasure.

Takeaway #5: Understanding the applicable lawful basis or bases for processing data — especially any applicable limitations or exceptions to data subject rights under that basis — and designing your system accordingly are critical to building GDPR-compliant blockchain solutions.

Avoiding a Collision
Ultimately, whether these two forces are on a collision course has yet to be determined. Avoiding a collision will require some favorable interpretations by EU regulators to ensure that the GDPR does not deprive the EU and EU data subjects of the benefits offered by blockchain technology.

A decision by EU officials that public keys used in appropriately designed blockchain solutions do not themselves constitute personal data would go a long way toward reconciling blockchain technology with the GDPR.
Even if such a determination is made, users of blockchain solutions should monitor whether technological developments, specifically in data storage or encryption, would affect or change such a determination. At this critical moment, it is imperative that blockchain firms understand the GDPR’s framework and take a proactive stance, developing technologies and legal positions that carefully account for the GDPR’s requirements.

As these two powerful forces continue to emerge and take effect, EU regulators and blockchain technologists alike would do well to remember that the GDPR and blockchain-based solutions share many fundamental goals, such as the right of individuals to control their own data and the minimization of data sharing. To demonstrate the compatibility of blockchains and the GDPR, these principles should be leveraged to the greatest extent possible in blockchain solution architectures.

The Final Word: With the right technical architecture and legal analysis, companies can harness the benefits of a blockchain while ensuring that data stored on a blockchain is compliant with GDPR requirements.",REGULATION,0.9991
2018/6/5,South Korean Supreme Court Rules Bitcoin Is an Asset,"South Korea’s Supreme Court just ruled that bitcoin is a legally recognizable asset. The landmark ruling occurred on May 30, 2018, and it overturns a decision made by one of the country’s lower courts in a case dating back to last year.

In September 2017, the Suwon District Court charged 33-year-old Ahn with the sale and distribution of child pornography. Operating a website since 2013, Ahn was arrested in May of 2017 for disseminating some 235,000 obscene files. Even though the court handed Ahn a guilty verdict and 18 months in prison for his actions, it did not confiscate the 216 bitcoins Ahn accumulated in exchange for the porn.

According to the court, the government could not seize Ahn’s bitcoins because, unlike other assets tied to illicit dealings, they aren’t tangible.

“It is not appropriate to confiscate bitcoins because they are in the form of electronic files without physical entities, unlike cash,” the court ruled. “Virtual currency cannot assume an objective standard value.”

Now, the country’s Supreme Court thinks otherwise. The Suwon District Court’s decision was appealed, and, upon being challenged in South Korea’s highest court, it didn’t hold up.

Seeing as Ahn accrued his digital fortune in exchange for an illegal service, the court reversed the decision and mandated that it is lawful for the government to confiscate it.

“Korean law stipulates that a seizable hidden asset ranges from cash, deposits, stocks, and other forms of tangible and intangible objects holding standard value,” the ruling from this Tuesday reads. “Bitcoin is intangible and comes in the form of digitized files, but it is traded on an exchange and can be used to buy goods. Therefore, receiving bitcoins is an act of taking profits.”

Ahn’s sentence will remain the same, but he’ll have to forfeit 191 bitcoins, worth roughly $1.4 million at press time along with some $654,000 in cash. Tracking Ahn’s transactions on Bitcoin’s ledger, the court was able to determine how many bitcoins he received as payment.

“[Ahn] received bitcoins by giving a certain bitcoin address to pornography watchers online. Records stored on the Bitcoin blockchain proved that bitcoins sent to him should be seen as profits online,” the court ruling states.

The ruling is a decisive, if roundabout, benchmark for cryptocurrency’s legal status in the country. It gives digital assets like bitcoin enhanced legitimacy at a time when South Korea is also in the process of legalizing and regulating Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). After effecting a domestic ban on ICOs in September of last year, the South Korean government has approached the cryptocurrency industry with ambivalent resolve. Tuesday’s ruling and the outlook of a formal framework for token sales, however, seem to be steering official policy in a clearer, more proactive direction.",REGULATION,0.7269
2018/6/7,"SEC Chairman: Cryptocurrencies Like Bitcoin Are Not Securities, but Most ICOs Are","U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Jay Clayton states that the SEC will not be bending the rules anytime soon when it comes to cryptocurrencies and that while bitcoin remains a commodity, all initial coin offering (ICO) tokens — or coins offered through a fundraising process — classify as securities.

“We are not going to do any violence to the traditional definition of a security that has worked for a long time,” he explained to CNBC. “There’s no need to change the definition. A token, a digital asset, where I give you my money and you go off and make a venture, and in return for giving you my money I say ‘you can get a return’[;] that is a security and we can regulate that. We regulate the offering of that security and regulate the trading of that security.”

The fight has been ongoing since April of this year, when the Venture Capital Working Group — an association of lawyers, traders and crypto enthusiasts alike — gathered to meet with the SEC and assist regulators in viewing virtual currencies as “utility tokens” rather than securities.

Utility tokens often garner more practical uses than securities and allow customers direct access to a company’s products or services. While utilities are generally exempt from SEC rules, securities, on the other hand, often represent stakes in a company’s offerings. Users can garner capital or profit by investing in securities, which makes them subject to strict regulatory scrutiny.

One of the biggest questions crypto-investors have had is whether ether — the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency — would fall under this category. In its earliest days, ether was originally offered as a presale (now ICO) token, but it has since become highly decentralized, which could potentially bar it from “security status.”

Clayton says that contrary to popular belief, the SEC is willing to assist ICOs to enter a plane of legitimacy, granted their organizers are willing to comply with the organization’s rules.

“If you have an ICO or a stock, and you want to sell it in a private placement, follow the private placement rules,” he explained. “If you want to do any IPO with a token, come see us.”

Nigel Greene — CEO and founder of the investment firm deVere Group — says Clayton’s stance on ICOs and cryptocurrencies is a positive sign that digital assets are becoming more mainstream.

“The SEC is right to insist that the digital coins, such as bitcoin, which are replacement for sovereign currencies, such as the dollar, sterling, yen and euro, are not securities,” he said. “I believe the SEC is also right that tokens — which [Clayton] did not name — that act as digital assets are securities. This clarification by the SEC removes some of the uncertainty that has been swirling around the crypto sector and serves to strengthen the overall proposition of many major cryptocurrencies. The SEC’s invaluable and far-sighted work in this area once again highlights how many governments, central banks and regulators around the world are all now recognizing the scale and potential of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.”",REGULATION,0.0788
2018/6/11,Swiss Bank to Allow Business Accounts for Crypto Companies,"Switzerland’s mortgage bank Hypothekarbank Lenzburg (Hypi) has announced that it will open business accounts for crypto companies.

While cryptocurrency and blockchain technology have been widely accepted in Switzerland, the banks have not been as friendly. With the exception of the Falcon Private Bank, which offers asset management services, Hypi will be the first Swiss bank to open its arms to the crypto community.

Hypothekarbank Lenzburg CEO Marianne Wildi said that a bank like Hypi, focused primarily on technology, has to engage with the blockchain industry. ""As a bank that is technologically oriented and pursues a cooperative strategy in the field of fintech, it is also one credibility to work with the young industry of crypto and blockchain companies in Switzerland.""

Wildi, who has advocated for the introduction of a crypto-franc in the past, added that while her bank is looking forward to working with crypto companies, they are well aware of the money laundering problems that come with them.

She said the bank had studied the relevant compliance issues and risks associated with the industry, in addition to informing the Swiss regulators before deciding to work with crypto companies.

According to Wildi, the selection process for new customers will be rigorous as Hypothekarbank Lenzburg will only consider blockchain companies after carrying out in-depth due diligence on them. The bank will use an experienced third party to analyze inquires and run background checks before the bank makes a final decision.

The announcement from Hypothekarbank Lenzburg comes some few days after the Swiss Blockchain Taskforce launched a petition calling for ""bank accounts for blockchain companies.""

Switzerland is a prime incubator for everything crypto and blockchain related. New data reports shows the country is the largest contributor of ICO funds relative to the number of ICOs launched elsewhere. The Swiss city of Zug, known as ""Crypto Valley"" will also conduct its first municipal vote using a blockchain on June 25, 2018.",REGULATION,0.2263
2018/6/12,Colombian Banks Shut Down Buda Crypto Exchange Accounts,"Colombian banks have closed all the accounts of South American cryptocurrency exchange Buda.com without warning or explanation.

The company experienced a similar issue in Chile some months back, where several banks decided to close its account along with those of several other exchanges.

According to local news, the move by the Colombian banks was unexpected, and the banks didn’t disclose why it was closing the accounts. Buda.com sent an email to its customers where it explained the problems it was facing which were affecting withdrawals.

The exchange said the closure of its accounts was sudden which affects the company’s operations and its users seeking to access their funds in Colombian pesos.

Buda.com CEO Alejandro Beltrán said the closed accounts were domiciled with Bancolombia, BBVA and Davivienda.

Buda.com started noticing irregularities on the Bancolombia platform before bank officials told the exchange its account had been closed.

The move by the banks might be linked to an internal circular from the Colombian Financial Superintendent wherein banks were advised not to interact with crypto platforms.

Beltrán, however, believes the circular was a recommendation to the banks, not an order.

Other Colombian exchanges such as BitINKA and Panda Exchange haven't reported any issues with the banks.

A day before the banks closed Buda.com's accounts, the Colombian Senate held a session on the potential of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

Senator Navarro Wolff, who convened the Third Senate Committee, stated that blockchain technology can be beneficial to the country in the areas of finance, electoral systems and management of public contracts. But Wolff also stipulated, ""Regulation is required to protect the consumer and the user.""",REGULATION,0.5908
2018/6/13,India's Central Bank Admits to Banning Crypto Accounts Without Research,"In a fresh new twist, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has admitted to issuing its ban on cryptocurrency-related accounts spontaneously, without taking time to study and understand how cryptocurrencies work.

In reply to a Right to Information query filed by a local lawyer with the Twitter handle Blockchainlaw91, the bank revealed that its decision to ban cryptocurrency-related accounts in the country was made without due consultation or study.

How It Started
India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, started warning its citizens against the dangers of investing in cryptocurrencies in 2013, which was followed by two other warnings in 2017, before coming down hard on the industry earlier this year.

On April 5, 2018, RBI published an announcement, stating that it was banning the country's banks from dealing with any business or ""entities dealing with or settling [virtual currencies].""

RBI Deputy Governor B.P. Kanungo who spoke to reporters said there was a three-month grace period for businesses providing such services to wind down operations.

The bank said the move was motivated by the need to protect Indian customers and prevent money laundering.

In 2017, prior to the ban, the Indian government had formed a committee, which included the RBI, with the aim of studying virtual currencies and how they work.

The committee had suggested banning cryptocurrency exchanges in the country, but the surging price of bitcoin toward the end of the year led to a quick reversal of that position and the creation of a new panel to study cryptocurrencies.

Surprisingly, in its reply to Blockchainlaw91’s query, the Reserve Bank of India revealed that its decision to ban the bank’s activities with crypto-based businesses was not backed up by any independent study or research.

Petitions and Migration
The Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) — which includes Indian crypto exchange Zebpay — have filed a writ petition to overturn RBI’s ban which prohibits banks from dealing with crypto-based businesses. The case is currently at the Supreme Court with a hearing date fixed for July 20.

Since the ban on crypto, there have been claims that blockchain businesses could be forced overseas.

Joel John, a research analyst at a U.K.-based blockchain company who spoke with the local media, believes crypto companies can easily migrate to friendlier countries to set up new entities. He said: ""Companies moving abroad is not a new trend, but the regulatory complexities faced by blockchain companies have accelerated it.""

It is gradually becoming a pattern for governments to make spontaneous decisions on cryptocurrency without first seeking to understand how it works. Russia and Japan have each tried to ban crypto businesses before ultimately softening their stances.",REGULATION,-0.9211
2018/6/13,EU’s European Blockchain Observatory and Forum to Host Blockchain AMA,"The European Union (EU) has announced that it will host an online Ask Me Anything (AMA) session on June 18, 2018, at 6 p.m. CEST. The event, organized and hosted by the European Blockchain Observatory and Forum of the EU, will last for 90 minutes and cover blockchain technologies with in-depth explanations, interactive discussions with panelists and public questions answered live.

The European Blockchain Observatory and Forum was created as a European Parliament pilot project with a mission to accelerate blockchain innovation and the development of the blockchain ecosystem within the EU and establish Europe as a global leader in the field. The Blockchain Observatory and Forum is currently operating under the European Commission (EC)’s Directorate General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CONNECT). Their partners include ConsenSys AG (general contractor), the University of Southampton, the Knowledge Media Institute at the Open University, University College London and the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts.

The event will be streamed live on YouTube. Viewers are invited to comment and ask questions via Twitter. To participate, viewers should include both #AMAblockchain and @EUBlockchain in a tweet. For example, “What is the official position of the EU on cryptocurrencies #AMAblockchain @EUBlockchain?” Selected tweets will be addressed and answered live.

“Technologies like blockchain can help reduce costs while increasing trust, traceability and security,” said Andrus Ansip, vice president for the Digital Single Market, in a February 2018 EU press release announcing the launch of the EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum.

“They have huge potential for making social and economic transactions more secure online by guarding against an attack and removing the need for any middleman. We want to build on Europe's substantial talent base and excellent startups to become a leading world region that will develop and invest in the rollout of blockchain.”

The announcement emphasizes that the EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum will play an active role in helping Europe to seize new opportunities offered by blockchain technology, build expertise and show leadership in the field, and promote an open forum for blockchain technologists, innovators, citizens, industry stakeholders, public authorities and regulators.

“I see blockchain as a game changer and I want Europe to be at the forefront of its development,” said Mariya Gabriel, commissioner for the Digital Economy and Society. “We need to establish the right enabling environment — a Digital Single Market for blockchain so that all citizens can benefit, instead of a patchwork of initiatives. The EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum is an important step in that direction.”

The announcement states that the Blockchain Observatory and Forum is intended to support the EC's work on FinTech, which is considered a priority of the EC and is expected to play a major role in achieving the objectives related to the development of the single market, Banking Union, the Capital Markets Union and retail financial services.

“Among the many technologies that are driving digital innovation, blockchain has the potential to be truly transformative for financial services and markets,” said Valdis Dombrovskis, vice president responsible for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union. “The Blockchain Observatory and Forum will monitor developments and also inform our policy making.”

2018/6/13,Proposed Regulations Could Cause Major Shifts in Canadian Crypto Businesses,"Canada’s government has released draft regulations for “virtual currencies” with a consultation period of 90 days, saying that proposed regulatory changes could mean a loss of $60 million over 10 years for businesses that deal in cryptocurrencies but will improve Canada’s international reputation and make it easier for crypto businesses to deal overseas.

The Canadian crypto business community is still assessing the new proposed regulations but a number of experts have told Bitcoin Magazine that the impact on the community will be “massive” and “significant” and may result in a shake-up and consolidation of companies, including blockchain companies currently in the space.

Amber D. Scott, CEO of Outlier Solutions, a company that focuses on helping bitcoin and blockchain crypto startups to understand and comply with government regulations, said:

“If the definitions are broadly interpreted, there could be significant dislocation in both the cryptocurrencies and blockchain communities that were not expecting to be regulated in this way. This includes any blockchain company that has issued, sold or traded a token that fits within the definition of ‘virtual currency.’”

Among other proposals, the new regulations will require firms (including exchanges) to keep detailed records of users and inform the government about suspicious activities, provide written policies and procedures, undergo a risk assessment and be ready for audits.

Jason Beitchman, a commercial litigation lawyer in Toronto with experience in anti-money laundering and cryptocurrency litigation, told Bitcoin Magazine:

“The impact on the cryptocurrency business is going to be massive. I can see it playing a significant role in allowing some market participants to rise to the top and separate themselves from others who don’t get out ahead of compliance issues.”

Beitchman notes that some of the language in the draft regulations seems strangely vague and unclear:

“I found the language in the second part of the definition of ‘virtual currency’ to be curious: ‘information that enables a person or entity to have access to a digital currency.’ What kind of information? This seems unusually vague and broad. Isn’t a webpage explaining how to trade in bitcoin ‘information’ that would enable a person to have access to a digital currency?”

Beitchman credits crypto companies for their generally imaginative marketing and innovative technology but says:

“... in time, cryptocurrency businesses will be forced to focus on the more brown-bag aspects of long-term and self-sustaining financial services businesses. These include a focus on operations, administration, compliance and legal. I expect we will see some portions of the sector embrace this development and other parts either ignore it or avoid it, at their peril.”

Evan Thomas, who practices compliance law in Toronto, told Bitcoin Magazine:

“Speaking for myself only, the regulations will undoubtedly have significant implications for many cryptocurrency and blockchain businesses.”

Thomas also reiterated that the regulations were not very clear on things like defining virtual currencies. The language used could mean a whole raft of businesses that deal in value transfer services.

“The commentary with the draft regulations suggests that ‘dealing in’ activities ‘include virtual currency exchange services and value transfer services,’ but there are many other businesses, such as miners, mining pools and developers of tokenized applications, that could be considered ‘dealing in virtual currencies,’ depending on how that phrase is interpreted,” he said.

Scott agrees that the language could be considerably clearer:

“The biggest issue that I see is that some of the definitions can be interpreted very broadly. Unfortunately, regulators sometimes get focused on the ‘letter’ rather than the ‘intent’ of the regulations. In practice, this means that if the Department of Finance doesn't tighten up some of the wording or provide additional exclusions, business models that don't really present much money laundering or terrorist financing risk (like in-game tokens) or things that are already regulated (like securities tokens) may be swept in.”

What Happens Now?
There's a 90-day comment period, then the Department of Finance redrafts the final version. Once this is published, there will be a 12-month transition period for compliance, meaning that it will likely take at least 15 months or longer for everything to be fully in force.

Even though this is a draft, Scott noted, the final versions of regulations like these are usually very similar to the draft version.

“I don't think that we're likely to see substantial shifts, but there are real opportunities to refine the content (better definitions, exclusions for things that shouldn't be captured, etc.) for interested companies and organizations.”

Beitchman’s view is that there is not likely to be a significant challenge from the crypto community and that other types of financial services may be better able to afford to make presentations to the Department of Finance. He further suggested that some of the significant issues that could arise will be resolved in the courts over the next 5–10 years through regulatory or litigation proceedings.

“Advocacy and lobbying activity is a highly sophisticated business strategy that requires a clear vision, funding and either large market share or wide-spread consensus,” he said. “While I am hopeful that there will be a positive dialogue with Finance, there are certainly challenges in advancing cryptocurrency interests here.”

“You also have to look at the sectors that traditionally have a large advocacy and lobbying presence in financial services and consider whether and how those sectors may be participating in the comments process,” he added.

Scott’s company, Outlier Solutions, will be active in the comment process:

“I expect that we'll be spending the next 90 days telling people not to panic. We participate in a number of industry groups and will be submitting comments through them, as well as on our own behalf. We've also set up a survey for community members that want to comment but may be reticent to have their names attached to comments (so no personal information is required).”",REGULATION,0.9964
2018/6/14,SEC Director of Corporate Finance: Ether Is Not a Security,"In an informal statement made at Yahoo Finance’s All Market Summit: Crypto, William Hinman, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s director of corporate finance, indicated that the regulatory agency has no plans to deem ether a security.

“... based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions,” Hinman said in a speech at the summit.

Along with ether, Hinman stated that the SEC would not classify bitcoin as a security, either. Rather, both cryptocurrencies function similar to commodities like gold, silver or oil, the agency believes.

But not all coins are created equal, Hinman expressed in his speech, and the SEC’s leniency on crypto’s top assets won’t relieve tokens from scrutiny. Tokens and Initial Coin Offerings, he continued, are most likely to be considered securities. The distinction lies in how the asset is offered or sold to the public.

“… strictly speaking, the token — or coin or whatever the digital information packet is called — all by itself is not a security … But the way it is sold — as part of an investment; to non-users; by promoters to develop the enterprise — can be, and, in that context, most often is, a security — because it evidences an investment contract,” Hinman stated.

This analysis seems to prioritize circumstance over semantics when deeming a token’s securities status. Projects will often dance around their token’s nomenclature to avoid self-branding as something that could be seen as a security, but Hinman conveyed that the SEC isn’t fooled by the verbal footwork. He made it clear in his speech that “simply labeling a digital asset a ‘utility token’ does not turn the asset into something that is not a security … the economic substance of the transaction always determines the legal analysis, not the labels.”

Hinman appeared to contradict himself when he dove into an analysis of token sales likely falling under the blanket of securities, only to dismiss ether from this classification. But this absolution comes from “putting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether,” he said, as a token or coin can’t be deemed a security if no central organization or company is directing it after launch.

“Can a digital asset originally sold in a securities offering eventually be sold in something other than a security?” he posits, eventually concluding that it cannot. “But what about cases where there is no longer any central enterprise being invested in or where the digital asset is sold only to be used to purchase a good or service available through the network on which it was created? I believe in these cases the answer is a qualified ‘yes.’”

The speech shed substantial clarity on a question that has loomed over the industry for some time: namely, whether or not ether would be ruled as a security. And, while this speech is sure to quell the anxieties of enthusiasts and investors alike, it leaves a gray area open for the SEC to color in its treatment of each individual token and coin under Hinman’s interpretation.

Still, the developments are positive for an industry that, in the context of the United States, has made a slow crawl toward regulatory legitimacy.

“We are glad the SEC agrees with our long held analysis of how securities law applies to decentralized cryptocurrency networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum,” Coin Center Executive Director Jerry Brito said in a statement. “We are thrilled to see it take a strong pro-innovation approach to this nascent technology. With this guidance, the SEC is showing that taking a pro-innovation approach does not have to come at the expense of protecting investors.”

While the words carry weight from one of the SEC’s highest officials, it’s worth noting that they were spoken somewhat informally and may not represent a cohesive message across the SEC’s regulatory staff.

This morning, Valerie Szczepanik, the SEC’s first crypto czar, issued what looks like a caveat on this front, stating in a panel at the summit that individual staffer comments may not be wholly in line with the SEC’s official stance.",REGULATION,-0.2584
2018/6/29,A Nuanced Look At Crypto Assets as Securities In Light of SEC Comments,"On June 14, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) director of corporate finance made waves in the cryptocurrency space when he commented at Yahoo Finance’s All Market Summit: Crypto that ether is not a security. The statement carries weight.

His words led to a flurry of speculation about the potential implications of what this means for Ethereum as well as the larger cryptocurrency ecosystem with regards to development and regulation.

It should be noted that the shifting status of regulatory terms can be confusing and contrary to the logic of programming languages that cryptocurrencies use. As a result, Adam B. Levine dedicated much of Episode #371 of his show, Let’s Talk Bitcoin, to clearing up misconceptions about the SEC’s stance. To do this, he invited lawyer and programmer Stephen Palley for an in-depth interview.

Discretion in the Legal World
Levine began by reading an abridged version of the SEC director’s speech, or as he dubbed it, “When Howey Met Gary.” Next, Levine spoke with Palley to hammer out what the speech is stating. In the speech, Director William Henman recalled the 1946 Supreme Court ruling of SEC v.s. W.J. Howey Co., which first laid out the terms for what defines an asset, such as land purchases or services contracts, to be a government regulated by the Securities Act.

Under this act, the form of the contract itself is of less importance than the actual economic substance of these transactions. This means that any number of assets can still qualify as securities as long as they fulfill certain qualifications.

Qualifications include:

Assets being specifically promoted by a group with a controlling interest in daily operations;
Assets being purchased by consumers under some reasonable expectation of profit; and
Assets wherein there is significant asymmetry of information between the promoters and purchasers of an asset.
Securities regulations primarily exist to ensure a third party, namely a regulatory entity, is well-informed enough to judge if there is a reasonable guarantee of a safe investment, without compromising trade secrets that promoter firms do not want made public.

Furthermore, Henman stated that the decentralization offered by cryptocurrency models such as ether prevent a single promoter entity from actually gaining significant leverage in information or control that consumers would need protection from. This means certain applications of cryptocurrencies can be sold as securities, but the format itself does not require this level of regulation.

A Legal Perspective
Palley, a practicing lawyer of 20 years, explained some of the concerns that have made this possible ruling particularly sticky for the world of cryptocurrencies. Palley claimed that specific types of legal contracts are similar to executable programmable code, yet legal verdicts operate in a sufficiently more complex way. Legal verdicts require contextual considerations that must be made of the technical form as well as the economic realities of various interactions. This ambiguity is often understood by programmers that, legally, the most uncharitable interpretation of a ruling will be applied unilaterally.

Palley gave an example by comparing the factors which make ether not a security while conceivably making ripple qualify as a security. Evidence for this is that the original developers of Ethereum have largely distanced themselves from the project so that they do not form a distinct entity still invested in the profit and daily operations of this platform. Ripple, on the other hand, is still one entity. Ethereum also held back a much smaller percent of ether tokens for their developers while Ripple held onto enough tokens to retain a controlling interest. For these reasons, there are easily observed asymmetries in the Ripple platform that could well classify its assets as securities.

The Future of Crypto-Based Tort Action
Palley went on to ruminate on the implications that recent lawsuits against Tezos might have on future civil suits against cryptocurrency developers. Using his inside experience as a practicing lawyer working in the cryptocurrency space, Palley stated that many civil class-action suits are unable to find plaintiffs even in the event of potentially dubious actions for the simple reason that no one wants to sue a firm that is continuing to make them money. After all, tort actions of this nature typically take place as an attempt to jump on potential violations to regain lost investment money through damages if the investments themselves are no longer profitable.

Palley claimed that the lawsuits against Tezos fall under this category. He stated that Tezos has conducted its own business with enough good faith that the plaintiffs allege that the business model itself is somehow improper, rather than Tezos specifically engaging in improper decisions at the micro-level. Under this trend, Palley speculated that the most significant factor in uncharitable interpretations of cryptocurrency-related laws will take place under market contracts for the space as a whole.",REGULATION,0.4404
2018/6/29,Malta Approves Favorable Cryptocurrency Bills in Next Step as a Blockchain Island,"The Maltese Parliament has approved three cryptocurrency and blockchain bills in its next efforts to make Malta one of the most desirable locations for setting up blockchain enterprises.

According to legislative records, the bills, which were introduced to the parliament by Parliamentary Secretary for Financial Services, Digital Economy and Innovation Silvio Schembri, were approved unanimously on Tuesday, June 26, 2018.

The bills detail the regulation of ICOs and cryptocurrencies and the process for setting up crypto-based businesses in Malta. The news, which Schembri shared via a tweet, makes Malta one of the first countries to pursue such legislation.

“Today, Maltese Parliament unanimously approved three bills on DLT/blockchain, a 1st in the World. Honored to have driven these bills,"" he said.

The three bills are ""The Virtual Financial Assets Act,"" ""The Malta Digital Innovation Authority Act,"" and ""The Innovative Technology Arrangements and Services Act,"" respectively.

The Virtual Financial Assets Act (VFA)
The VFA will regulate initial coin offerings. The law would require new companies raising capital through ICOs to publish white papers that outline a detailed description for the entire project. Issuers are also expected to make their financial history public.

The Malta Digital Innovation Authority Act
This bill formalizes regulatory procedures for the cryptocurrency and the blockchain industry. It also establishes the Malta Digital Innovation Authority (MDIA), which will serve as the regulatory body for the industry. The functions of the MDIA will be carried out by a Board of Governors, headed by a CEO. Local news outlet the Times of Malta confirmed the appointment of Stephen McCarthy as the first chief executive of the Malta Digital Innovation Authority.

Technology Arrangements and Services Bill
This bill details the registration and certification of technology service providers and technology arrangements, and it focuses on the registration of exchanges in Malta. Industry insiders believe this bill was created to make Malta the destination of choice for cryptocurrency exchanges.

Malta, which is known as a friendly hub for blockchain businesses, has already attracted some crypto heavyweights such as OKEx and Binance.

The new bills are expected to guide the government on how to embrace the technology and achieve its aim of becoming a hotspot for crypto and blockchain businesses.",REGULATION,0.7003
2018/7/3,SEC Seeks Comments on Another Bitcoin ETF,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is seeking comments on another bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). The proposal in question calls for the listing and trading of SolidX bitcoin shares, and stems from the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust, which states it will invest in “bitcoin only.”

VanEck and SolidX first joined forces in early June. This will be the former’s third attempt to build a bitcoin investment project from the ground up.

CEO Jan van Eck commented, “We believe that collectively, we will build something that may be better than other constructs currently making their way through the regulatory process. A properly constructed, physically-backed bitcoin ETF will be designed to provide exposure to the price of bitcoin, and an insurance component will help protect shareholders against the operational risks of sourcing and holding bitcoin.”

The SEC is now asking for comments on the Trust’s newly proposed regulatory changes from “interested persons.” Though several companies have tried to list bitcoin ETFs before, concerns regarding the cryptocurrency’s liquidity and its consistent price swings have led to rising concern amongst SEC representatives, which can make the listing process difficult or long-winded.

This may change in the future, however, as officials are now working on a new plan that would ease present legislation and boost low-risk ETF approval rates. The new laws would allow companies that sell ETFs to “launch plain vanilla versions” without requesting or obtaining approvals from respective SEC regulators. Officials say they are hoping to increase both innovation and competition in the financial industry by removing some of the current blockades.

This plan would apply strictly to open-ended ETFs — funds that bear no restrictions or limits on the number of shares they can issue — which already make up most of the ETF space. However, issuers would still be required to obtain permission from the SEC to sell funds under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Commissioner Kara Stein explains, “The rule would also include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETF’s current net asset value per share, market price and premium or discount.”

The proposal is garnering praise from several figures and organizations in the finance industry like the Investment Company Institute, based in Washington. Representatives of the trade group commented that they’re in favor of regulated funds, stating, “Investors — and the asset managers who serve them — deserve a more uniform ETF regulatory framework. The time is right to codify these orders into a single rule.”",REGULATION,0.9926
2018/7/5,Maltese Parliament Passes Three Blockchain Bills into Law,"The Maltese Parliament has passed three bills into law that establish a regulatory framework for the country's blockchain sector, Malta Today reports.

Just last week, the Parliament “unanimously voted” to approve these bills in its second reading. The bills include the Malta Digital Innovation Authority Act, the Innovative Technological Arrangement and Services Act, and the Virtual Financial Asset Act.

Silvio Schembri, the Parliamentary Secretary for Financial Services, Digital Economy and Innovation, shared an update on Twitter about the new development, which he believes will make Malta “the first world jurisdiction to provide legal certainty to this space.”

“The 3 Bills that will regulate DLT [distributed ledger technology] have been approved by Parliament and enacted into law,” the tweet reads.

The blockchain bills are designed to make Malta a hotspot for blockchain and cryptocurrency companies. Schembri believes that they will attract new businesses and put investors’ minds to rest.

While celebrating the new milestone in an update shared on Twitter, Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said that the new laws will make Malta a “global hub for market leaders” in the blockchain industry.

According to Muscat, the new legislation proves that Malta is the first country globally with a “holistic legislative framework” for regulating the blockchain space. Blockchain companies now have the legal tools necessary to operate in a forward-looking, regulated economy, the prime minister added.

With the new blockchain laws, Malta has distinguished itself as among the world's most friendly blockchain jurisdictions and has taken yet another step in becoming the world’s blockchain island.

The Maltese government has been working through different avenues to apply blockchain technology to public service. Earlier this year, it partnered with Omnitude to improve the transport system using DLT. In the past, the government has conducted a feasibility study using blockchain technology to record academic certificates.

Many crypto and blockchain businesses have already set up shop in Malta, as well. The most notable ones include OKEx, Binance and BitPay.",REGULATION,0.9863
2018/7/19,A Basic Guide to the Digital Age: Breaking Down Congress’ Crypto Hearing,"Yesterday, Congress addressed in two full hearings why it’s time to start taking a closer look at why and how digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, are impacting U.S. marketplaces.

The following condensed information is a run-down of what the House Committee on Agriculture and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) discussed during the hearings regarding cryptocurrency and distributed ledger technology (DLT).

Congress Has a Vested Interest in Securities and Economic Growth
Some might find it odd to see the House Committee on Agriculture represented at a hearing on digital assets and their related technologies. But Chairman Michael Conaway made it very clear why the House Agriculture Committee was there, explaining that they have a vested interest in shaping and constructing the definition of a security because it directly impacts the definition of a commodity.

Working in tandem, both Chairman Conaway and Ranking Member Collin Peterson identified five main goals for clarifying blockchain industry regulation:

Promoting a safe, efficient and transparent tokens market
Proper regulation doesn’t always mean intrusive regulation
Identifying whether tokens are securities
Parsing through whether our current laws are appropriate to apply
Ensuring enough oversight to help the space grow responsibly
Understanding Why Blockchain Technology Is Valuable
The panel of witnesses sitting on Capitol Hill presented in-depth yet simplistic explanations for what needs to be done. Applying those proposals, however, is an entirely different conversation.

Observing the Communities Using the Technology. According to Joshua Fairfield — William Donald Bain Family Professor of Law at Washington and Lee University School of Law in Staunton, VA — the potential value of blockchain technology is considerable.

First, the technology has allowed for collaboration among communities of artists.

Second, new forms of corporations have begun to rise up.

Third, there is now a fast and low-cost check settlement opportunity, which helps to pave the way for immediate payments.

Fourth, by digitizing securities, it helps to place everything in an easily accessible format for all participants.

Fifth, having open and low-cost electronic mortgage and secure transactions filing systems in place helps ensure that the recording process of deeds and other property-related documents is secure.

Sixth, it provides for secure international remittances.

Lastly, the potential to bring the voting system onto the blockchain helps to minimize the potential for fraud-related incidents, as we have recently witnessed with Russia in the 2016 presidential election .

Expanding Online Property Rights is Vital to the Growth of Innovation
“Citizens need and want an expansion of their personal property rights online,” emphasized Fairfield. He went on to question whether the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) Howey Test is still the appropriate standard to apply. Instead, Fairfield proposed a more simplistic test — the “duck” test. “I believe that we should look to the outer bound to figure out what beneficial and damaging uses the technology presents,” he explained. “Look to how the communities are using it — then regulate.”

The Evolution from Tangible Property to Intangible Property
Fairfield pointed out that personal property has had some difficulty entering into the digital space. “We just don’t own that much personal property online,” he stated.

“Consider that people used to have record collections — now they have a subscription to Spotify. People used to have bookshelves — now they have Kindle accounts.”

But this behavior can be attributed to the early days of the internet, primarily movements like Napster, Limewire, Kazaa and online torrents. This led intellectual property (IP) owners to show concern as to the illegal copying and distribution of their work. “It took several decades to develop a technology like the blockchain, that could be traded, held, bought and sold — but not duplicated,” explained Fairfield.

The law professor concluded his proposal by stating that tokens aren’t just used as a security or a commodity, but rather as a way to represent our property interests and rights online — if we let it.  

Harmonizing Technology With Our Constitutional Rights. The next witness, Amber Baldet, CEO and co-founder of Clovyr, emphasized the importance in balancing the value of this technology with the need for protecting consumers and national security.

Take a Cautious Approach to Thoughtful, Innovative Technologies
The biggest takeaway from Baldet’s proposals was that we need to understand how to strike a balance with this technology while still respecting our constitutionally protected rights. She emphasized “those technologies that might disrupt a business or add complexity of regulating the internet,” as these have the potential to represent both a critical infrastructure and a publicly shared good.

What’s the Next Killer App?
According to Baldet, the biggest application on the blockchain market is money — specifically, the concept of peer-to-peer (P2P) payments. “These P2P payments will grow into a daily part of our professional and personal lives,” she said.

As we begin looking at different payment instruments, we must go back to fundamentals and ensure we understand the purpose of “bearer instruments.” These are documents that entitle its holder to rights of ownership or title to the underlying property, such as shares or bonds. If we are injecting blockchain technology and cryptocurrency into this space, it becomes even more relevant, as this technology can be applied to many things we own such as mortgages, securities, collectibles, IP rights and personal data. In a way, these new payment systems and accompanying currencies serve as unique “digital bearer assets,” as Baldet described.

Observe Other Countries’ Behaviors
While both the U.S. government and the accompanying marketplace are struggling to understand and apply these technological frameworks, other areas of the world are beginning to embrace the industry despite its gray areas and are learning by doing. Take Malta and Switzerland, for example. Malta has already earned its name as the world’s blockchain island, and Zug, a Swiss city just south of Zürich, has been called “Crypto Valley” for the plethora of blockchain companies operating in its limits.

In addition, Baldet also pointed to countries like Afghanistan and a handful of African countries that are looking to capitalize on the new technology. For example, in Afghanistan, blockchain technology has helped people like Roya Mahboob, CEO and co-founder of Digital Citizen Fund, to enroll over 9,000 Afghan women and girls in education programs. In efforts of empowering women to start their own businesses, the next steps are to begin putting on Bitcoin conferences to help showcase their projects.

Blockchain Technology Is Not the Answer to Every Problem
Most important, Baldet wants the world to recognize that the blockchain is not a panacea. “When it comes to electronic voting, we need to take extreme caution, as we aren’t ready to tackle the complex computer science and coordination problem,” she explained.

Why Venture Capitalists Can Benefit. “Crypto networks offer a new way to build digital services like any internet application that may exist today, such as ridesharing applications and social media applications,” said Scott Kupor, the managing partner at Andreessen Horowitz Capital Management, explaining that venture capitalists are interested in “crypto networks” as they relate to the crypto ecosystem.

Historical Precedent Is a Good Indicator
According to Kupor, the success of community-based networks can be traced back to two major movements — the open-source movement and the open-protocol movement. The open-source software movement started back in 1983 and was considered to be somewhat of a radical notion at the time.

Why is this relevant? Kupor goes on to explain.

A community of developers would publish their software and offer it up freely for others to modify and incorporate into their own projects. “This led to copyright initiatives,” explained Kupor. Today, open source is the primary development of software for the utilization of any data center, such as Linux- and Android-based applications. “This is extremely relevant when thinking about the potential for crypto networks, because we have platforms that are now able to support a variety of DApps [decentralized applications] and open-source ethos that encourage open innovation.”

On the other hand, open protocols are the structural foundation of the internet we are familiar with today. The idea behind these protocols is that the protocol wouldn’t change and would provide for a steadier process when it comes to understanding how the software infrastructure operates.

Introducing Tokens Into a New Generation
Tokens didn’t exist in prior generations, allowing for a direct financial incentive for community members to develop and govern their networks appropriately. “It’s the glue that binds the members in the community and provides incentives for all market participants,” said Kupor. “Understandably so, it creates a whole new set of challenges for regulators, consistent with recent statements from the SEC.”

Kupor ended proposing that a framework needs to be developed that requires a risk taking but, at the same time, provides for clarity and certainty to market participants, which results in market integrity.

Education Is Key: Don’t Be Foolish and Dismiss the Tech. Daniel Gorfine, CIO of the CFTC and director of LabCFTC, emphasized the need for us to continue studying and learning and to keep pace with an ever-evolving field.

“Given the potential to tokenize a broad range of economic assets, it is important to remind the public that digital assets can also be commodities or derivatives, depending on their term and how they are structured,” explained Gorfine.

“Given its potential and its challenges, the CFTC chairman has made it clear that the proper response by regulators is not to dismiss the entire movement as misguided and foolish, but rather to take the time to learn and facilitate the promise, and guard against risks and bad actors,” he continued.

Opening the Finance Sector Up to the Blockchain. The former CFTC chair, Gary Gensler, provided five reasons for why he believes blockchain technology can make a real difference in the finance sector:

It lowers costs and risks in the financial sector.
By bringing it into this world of public policy frameworks, it minimizes chances for illicit activities, ensures financial stability and protects investors and consumers.
The SEC and CFTC have a role to play, as evidenced by their notices and enforcement actions.
The ICO market is ripe with scams and frauds, and bad actors have found out how to use this new currency, including state actors — e.g., recent news of the 12 alleged Russian officials, and talks of Venezuela attempting to raise money off their oil and outrunning the U.S. sanctions policy.
There are gaps in our laws because, first and foremost, cryptocurrency exchanges are attempting to act as state money transmitters, similar to how Western Union and MoneyGram operate. This cannot work due to the complexity and traceability issues associated with these exchanges.
Additionally, there is a lack of brokered access, where you don’t have brokers sending off or issuing 1099-B’s to individuals. It’s only now that issuers of securities in the space are coming into this field, but at a very slow rate.

Finally, the unregulated, underlying crypto cash market is a mess, and it becomes very difficult for the CFTC to be able to predict future patterns or behaviors.

Gensler ended his statement by proposing a question on whether the CFTC or some other agency should be given additional authority to regulate this underlying cash crypto market, believing the CFTC to be best suited for the task.

At the end of a very long day of hearings, Congress seemed to be very receptive to the idea of this new technology, but it is still concerned about ensuring that it is properly regulated where appropriate. To view the hearing in full, you can watch it here.",REGULATION,0.9989
2018/8/3,“Not a Great Precedent”: Commissioner Discusses the SEC’s Latest ETF Decision,"When the SEC announced its rejection of the Winklevosses’ latest bitcoin ETF filing, the industry found itself reckoning with a problem on repeat: striving toward the goal of approval, another Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) proposal faced the SEC’s death knell.

At this point in the industry’s development, securing an ETF has become the space’s institutional albatross, the elusivity of which hangs over each successive rejection. The most recent filing was the Winklevosses’ second attempt to list a bitcoin-backed ETF, the first being shot down last year.

Earlier this year, some dozen ETF filings, like those by Van Eck Associates Corp., never even made it to the discussion table after the SEC withdrew the applications from consideration in January. Decisions for another five filings have been delayed until September. Lacking these approvals, the industry’s only institutional market offerings come in the form of the CBOE’s and CME’s futures contracts.

The market’s slow march toward establishing a bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund or Exchange Traded Product (ETP) has become a reminder that the space is still in the midst of growing pangs, and it’s an even more salient reminder that the wheels of regulation spin slowly — and not always in every industry’s favor.

SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce thinks these wheels should be turning a bit more quickly. Recently sworn into the commission after an appointment by President Trump, Peirce did not partake in the SEC’s 3-1 vote to strike down the latest proposal, but that hasn’t kept her from expressing her disagreement with the commission’s decision. She took to Twitter on the same day as the announcement, linking to her dissenting public statement.

In the following interview with Commissioner Peirce, Bitcoin Magazine delves further into her dissent, uncovering what the decision means for the future of regulation and what it will take for the SEC to give bitcoin ETFs/ETPs a nod of approval.

Bitcoin Magazine: What were the key factors that made you dissent to the SEC’s ruling and vote “yes” on the ETP?
Hestor Peirce: So, I didn't vote yes originally because I wasn't here — I got here six or seven months ago, and a lot of it happened at the staff level and they can get kicked up to the commission, which is what happened here. What made me vote against what the commission did? There were three things playing into that.

One, I disagree with how they read our statutory mandate. The way I read our mandate, we should have approved this one because we really shouldn’t have been looking to the underlying markets the way that we did in the order that they put out last week.

Second issue, I do think that institutionalization in this space would address some of the concerns they lay out in their order.

And the third thing, I think that, historically, the SEC has not been great on innovation, on welcoming innovation, and for me, this order perpetuated my concerns in this regard. We need to have a willingness to welcome new approaches and I’m worried that if we keep sending the message that we’re not open to hearing from people who have new ways of doing things, then people will say we’re going to take our business to another country.

BM: In your dissent, you talk about the SEC playing gatekeeper to the bitcoin market. Is this decision setting a disconcerting precedent, giving the SEC the power to deem what should and shouldn’t be considered an asset, or have we seen this kind of behavior before?
HP: I actually think that it’s not only happened in this context, but that it’s happened with prior orders as well; however, in those cases, they were approved. But even in the past, we’ve looked to underlying commodities markets, and I think that walks us down a road that we don’t want to go down and we can’t go down.

You know, in this particular case, there’s a lot being said about bitcoin. It is a new type of asset, and I think that that played into the decision that was ultimately made. I’m worried that, by looking through to underlying markets, we’ve opened a can of worms that we don’t want to open up, where we’d have to assess underlying markets for all of these different types of assets.

I do think it’s not a great precedent. It plays into a bit of a thread in securities regulations — at the federal and at the state level — which is that there’s an inclination among regulators to almost step into the shoes of the investor and say whether or not the investor should be making that particular decision, based on our assessment of the actual product — in this case, the actual asset. So yes, that is a disturbing precedent, because I can’t make assessments about those things.

There are lots of people spending lots of time thinking about this new asset class and they should be able to make decisions about it. I can‘t stand in their shoes and say, “I can see the future better than you can see the future, I can assess where this is going better than you can assess where this is going.”

So yes, I’m very worried about the SEC putting itself in the shoes of investors, which is what it was doing here. Because frankly if this product comes to market, investors might decide, “We’re just not interested in it.”

There are lots of things that investors are going to look at when they look at an ETP — there are other products out there and they are different. There are different characteristics, so let’s put it out there. As long as the disclosure is good and as long as the exchange can manage the trading of the product, let’s put it out there and let’s let investors vote up or down based on whether or not they buy it.

BM: To what extent does the SEC decision show a lack of trust in such self-regulatory bodies, at least for this industry?
HP: Well, I mean, I think it does show a bit of a lack of trust for our existing SROs, meaning the exchanges. In my case, I’d say, look, the exchange has thought about the product it wants to list, so if it’s gone through that thought process and addressed our concerns about how the product will trade, then it’s done its job, so we can let it go forward.

In terms of the bitcoin market generally, my concern with the order’s approach is that it says, “Look, these markets aren’t regulated.” To some extent that’s true, but there are some of them that are regulated by governments; the Gemini exchange is regulated at the state level.

But the point that often gets lost in these discussions about regulations is that there’s actually a lot of self-regulation, not in the formal SRO context, but I’ve listened to a lot of discussions between factions in the crypto world and they’re criticizing each other, sometimes very openly and very harshly, and they’re calling each other out for things.

That kind of healthy, transparent, private regulation is relevant to the discussion because, to the extent that someone is going to engage in manipulation in a market, other players in that market — whether its gold or cryptocurrency — other players in that market will care about that because it will affect them. So there is some sort of a natural push to have regulation that grows organically within a marketplace.

I think the order did not give enough attention to the fact that, especially when you bring institutions into a market like this, there’s going to be a pressure to privately monitor each other. It’s not self-regulation so much as you’re watching what your competitors are doing.

BM: Not so much self-regulation as self-preservation, in some ways.
HP: In some ways, right.

BM: It’s a bit of a catch-22, isn’t it? The SEC is essentially saying, “The market isn’t regulated enough, so we can’t start regulating it.”
HP: Yes. You know, to one degree, there is a bit of logic to that. I had that same reaction as you had. The counterpoint I would offer is that we’ve got futures markets, so those markets are still relatively new, so as those markets develop, you’ll see more institutionalization and more regulation.

So there are different avenues through which you can arrive at regulation, but that’s part of what I was trying to get at with the institutionalization qualm of my dissent: If you really want this market to be more orderly, then you’ve got to let some of these forces in that are going to bring order to it.

[Here’s] another interesting point: I think some of the people in the Bitcoin community would not welcome an ETP because that’s precisely the point of why they wanted this decentralized financial system, [one] that did not involve traditional players in the financial market.

BM: The SEC has, understandably, been leading efforts to regulate the crypto industry. Are there other federal departments and agencies that you believe could be picking up some slack to give the industry some clarity regarding legislation?
HP: The problem is that we each have our own regulatory jurisdiction, and so for something like an ETP, we’re the only game in town. You know, that’s not totally true because you could go to a different country as some folks have done. But if you’re talking about in the U.S., outside of the ETPs, people are thinking about ICOs. [ICOs are] something we have to address, whether or not something’s a security.

So I think we really do have a role to play, but on the positive side — you know, I’ve been fairly negative about where the SEC has been on some of this stuff — but on the positive side, we do have Valerie Szczepanik who is focusing on cryptocurrency issues in the division of corporation finance. She is someone who is quite knowledgeable. From people I’ve talked to outside of the agency who work in the crypto space, they’re quite comfortable with her as the top staff regulator in this space because she is quite knowledgeable. I do think that there is a positive trend going on here, as well.

That said, I think your point is a good one, as there are other regulators that are looking at this space more generally. There’s the CFTC, there’s the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s sandbox. There are different ways, and I think part of what we’re going to have to do is work with our fellow regulators because part of the problem is that it’s not clear which regulatory box things fit in. I think there needs to be more cross agency work so that we can encourage each other through that process.

Look, some of these technologies are here to stay and we’re going to have to figure out how to build a regulatory framework or build on our existing regulatory framework to make sure that these products and the people designing them and the people who are thinking about possible use cases can come and get guidance on how they can operate within legal parameters.

BM: In your dissent, you write that “the order analyzes the ETPs through a legal and regulatory framework derived from prior approval orders for commodities with very different characteristics.” In your opinion, does bitcoin and the wider crypto market that it’s spawned deserve their own regulatory guidelines? Do we need to write a new playbook for a new market?
HP: Is it an asset class that we need to design a new regulatory framework for? Maybe, but maybe that’s not the best approach. To the extent that something is being offered and is actually a security then we should probably regulate it as such.

The questions that people have now are “How long is it a security?” and “How do we trade these in a way that is in line with securities laws?” I tend to think — and I’m open to being convinced otherwise — but I tend to think that the right approach is to work with our existing securities law framework. To the extent that something is a commodity, work with our commodities law framework and to see whether there are areas where we need to provide guidance or update our rules to accommodate any difference.

BM: It’s something that a lot of us in the space juggle around with because we get frustrated when we see what appear to be antiquated guidelines imposing rules on something that is completely new. And there are certain areas where it is a little more cut and dried with securities.
HP: To that point, to the extent that there are specific guidelines that you all are running up against that are proving problematic to engaging in legitimate activity, I’d like to hear about those. Because it’s often talked about in these broad strokes.

I’d like to know: What are the particular issues you’re running up against that are giving concern to you? That’s really helpful because we can think about areas where we may need to update our rules or issue guidance to make it work.

BM: In the dissent, you write “when we do finally approve an ETP on bitcoin...” You didn’t say if. Do you believe this is inevitable?
HP: [Laughing] I’m a bit optimistic.

BM: Perhaps not inevitable but probable?
HP: Well, the reason that I anticipate that it’s probable is because there’s a lot of investor demand. And I think at some point that that will help push the agency. When that point will come, I can’t speculate on.

BM: Do you think that surveillance-sharing agreements are going to be a large part of this?
HP: Well, the order did focus on surveillance-sharing agreements as something that it was looking at, though I don’t know if the order’s authors would say that that’s the only approach for approval.

We consider each of these on the facts and circumstances, and that is how it should be. So I’m not speculating on any particular product, but I do think that there is interest in this area and I’m hopeful that, ultimately, we’ll be able to get there with an approval.",REGULATION,0.6249
2018/8/6,"Coinbase Renews Money Transmitter License in Wyoming, Reopens Services in State","Coinbase has announced that it has renewed its money transmitter license in Wyoming three years after terminating its activities in the state. The move marks a significant shift in the working relationship between the crypto exchange giant and state regulators following the expiry of the previous license in June 2015.

Working With Regulators
In a Medium post, Coinbase said that its Wyoming customers can now access the full range of its products, including Coinbase Consumer, Coinbase Market, Coinbase Prime and Coinbase Custody. The blog post described the move as one that will “spur innovation and economic activity for individuals, families and communities across the state.”

Coinbase went on in the statement to highlight its newfound cooperation with Washington state regulators.

“Coinbase welcomed the opportunity to work with Wyoming House of Representatives Majority Floor Leader David Miller, State Senator Eli Bebout, members of the Blockchain Task Force and their colleagues to find a solution that allows cryptocurrency custodians and exchanges to reestablish operations. We are also grateful for the assistance of Commissioner Forkner, Deputy Commissioner Mulberry, along with the examiners and staff from the Wyoming Division of Banking in their prompt approval of our money transmitter application,” the post reads.

Going further, Coinbase hailed its return to Wyoming as proof that regulators, lawmakers and cryptocurrency companies can work together to encourage innovation by finding ways to accommodate cryptocurrency trade under existing money transmission laws, even exempting them when necessary.

The post specifically mentions the removal of the requirement to double-reserve cryptocurrency assets of Wyoming residents as a critical point of the agreement reached with regulators, enabling it to return to the state.

Concluding with what some will see as a statement of intent from a platform that has recently been engaged in an aggressive growth phase, Coinbase states:

“...We seek excellence in compliance and advocate for common-sense policies that allow for innovation. We will continue collaborating with legislators and regulators across the U.S. and worldwide as we work to create an open financial system for the world.”",REGULATION,0.991
2018/8/8,The SEC Is Delaying Another Bitcoin ETF Decision,"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is in no hurry to review the pile of Bitcoin ETF filings it has been accumulating over the past year.

Not three weeks since postponing its decision on five other Bitcoin ETFs, the SEC has indicated in a public statement that it will be delaying its decision to approve or reject SolidX Bitcoin Shares until late September.

“Accordingly, the Commission, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, designates September 30, 2018, as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule change (File No. SR-CboeBZX-2018-040),” the statement reads.

Submitted back in June, the proposed rule change to permit the ETF comes from the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe), which was cleared to list Bitcoin futures in December of last year. If approved, the ETF would be listed on Cboe’s BZX exchange in cooperation with legacy investment management company VanEck and crypto startup SolidX. This is VanEck’s second attempt to list a Bitcoin ETF after their first attempt was nixed by the SEC last year.

This is also the BZX exchange’s second attempt to secure a Bitcoin ETF listing. On July 26, 2018, a day after the SEC prolonged its deliberation for Direxion Asset Management’s five filings, the SEC rejected BZX’s joint filing with the Winklevoss twins. The ETF was rejected on the grounds that BZX has “not met its burden under the Exchange Act and the Commission’s Rules of Practice to demonstrate that its proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5), in particular the requirement that its rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.”

With each successive rejection or prolonged decision, the industry continues to fight an uphill battle against regulators to secure its first exchange traded fund. Many believe such a listing would open the floodgates for institutional money.

SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce believes that it could also invite more mature regulation, both from the private and public sectors. On the latest rejection by the SEC, she expressed to Bitcoin Magazine that the decision is “not a great precedent,” believing that the SEC’s decision misconstrues the commission’s purpose to protect investors as a method to decide what is and isn’t a legitimate investment.",REGULATION,-0.4951
2018/8/10,Op Ed: Exploring the SEC’s New “Sufficiently Decentralized” Test,"The regulators have awoken. SEC Director William Hinman introduced novel concepts to the securities law analysis such that sellers of digital assets may have an escape valve. Yes, even if their initial sale triggered securities laws, later sales may not. The industry should not move forward without careful exploration of these concepts.

First order of business: Can digital assets change their colors? As outlined by Global Digital Finance, a digital asset can be a financial asset token (potentially coded as a security), a payment token (Hinman used the term “coin”), or a consumer token (Hinman used the term “token”). The relevant question is not whether an asset can change its token type, but whether the latter two types — a “coin” or “token” in Hinman’s words — can ever become securities.

Whisky as a Security?
Director Hinman’s discussion of Scotch proves instructive.

The SEC director carefully teased out a distinction between a consumer item and its manner of sale. The ultimate takeaway: Whisky is never a security, but its sale can trigger securities laws. It would be ridiculous to say whisky morphs into a security because of how it is sold; it always remains a non-security consumer item.

Replace “whisky” with “coin” or “token” and the logic remains sound. It makes no sense, then, to say a consumer or payment token can morph into a security. That is, unless the code itself changes such that the code itself represents stock or another type of security instrument.

This is more than semantics; precision matters. Following the above logic, developers need not fret about doing their job. So long as a developer creates a consumer or payment token, the developer does not create a security or anything that can morph into one. Activity outside of coding will be what makes securities laws applicable. This distinction should give comfort to the builders out there. Code without worry.

Activity outside of coding will be what makes securities laws applicable.
Anyone who wants to sell, however, should worry. The sale may inadvertently trigger securities laws. Purchasers in any sale will form expectations. The sales process must manage these expectations so that buyers do not think they will profit from the managerial efforts of others.

Hinman’s Guidance
Director Hinman’s remarks provide some principles to follow for anyone attempting a “coin” or “token” sale that rests outside of the securities regime. Keep these in mind when planning your sale.

Find your users.
In Howey, promoters sold orange groves “to hotel guests, not farmers.” If farmers bought the orange groves and worked the land, the Howey test would not exist. Find your farmers. Find the users who will use your network. This will help preserve the argument that you sold “to participants who need the functionality the network and the digital assets offer.”

Build something real, something useful.
The Howey analysis weakens when purchasers consume what they buy. A network with real use looks less like it involves an investment contract. The following facts indicate your buyers intend to consume tokens on your network: marketing targets actual users, buyers represent they will use tokens, buyers have purchase limits, and buyers have no financial incentive to hodl.

Cultivate a distributed village.
Director Hinman said a “sufficiently decentralized” network may not need the benefits of a disclosure regime. Combine prior research with Hinman’s suggestion that Bitcoin and Ethereum have sufficiently decentralized networks and practical guidance emerges:

Any network with node participation and geographic distribution at least as distributed as the Bitcoin network should be considered sufficiently decentralized.
Reward volatility may vary for small miners without making the network insufficiently decentralized.
The presence of centralized mining power (even up to 61 percent of weekly mining power split between three miners) does not make a network insufficiently decentralized.
The presence of powerful core developers or an influential foundation does not make a network insufficiently decentralized.
An open-source, proof-of-work network may be sufficiently decentralized at inception.
All this counsels toward creating a global, well-distributed network. How to further measure decentralization, especially at genesis or for proof-of-stake or delegated proof-of-stake networks, remains an open question ripe for a no-action letter request.

Share your secret sauce.
Hinman argued that decentralization correlated with a reduction in information asymmetry between promoter and purchaser. Yet decentralization and information asymmetry may coexist where only a small set of developers actually understand changes made to a decentralized network. Disclosure helps, but does not resolve, the asymmetry. Only consumer education can.

As a matter of policy, however, it would be difficult for a regulator to argue that purchasers need the protection of a disclosure regime where developers have disclosed everything. Layering a disclosure regime onto a completely transparent project would, in Hinman’s words, “add little value.”

Disclosure helps, but does not resolve, the asymmetry. Only consumer education can.
The suggestions above align surprisingly well with core philosophical tenets held by proponents of decentralization. But without clarity on “sufficient decentralization,” all token sales risk violating securities laws. Fortunately, the SEC has expressed willingness to work with industry participants. Companies should take advantage of this rare offer to shape how securities laws will apply for the foreseeable future.",REGULATION,0.9914
2018/8/21,Top Crypto Exchanges Join Winklevosses’ Self-Regulatory Organization,"Some of the crypto industry’s biggest exchanges are joining with the Winklevosses in an effort to bring self-regulation to a market that many perceive to be fly-by-night and unstructured.

Five months following its creation, the Virtual Commodity Association (VCA) has onboarded Bittrex, bitFlyer USA and Bitstamp, a site update reveals. A press release detailing the developments indicates that the VCA plans to hold its inaugural meeting in September 2018. On the docket for deliberation, the association plans to discuss membership guidelines, best practices for productive self-regulation and staffing appointments for the VCA’s executive director and board of directors.

“The initial participants in the VCA Working Group will include: Bitstamp, Inc., bitFlyer USA, Inc., Bittrex, Inc., and Gemini Trust Company, LLC. The Working Group will work toward the goal of establishing an industry-sponsored, self-regulatory organization (SRO) to oversee virtual commodity marketplaces,” the official press release states.

The first round of members to join since the Winklevosses’ created the self-regulatory organization with their Gemini exchange, the expansion represents a significant step toward private sector self-policing in an industry that has seen little regulatory direction from public sector institutions, particularly in the United States.

Last month, on July 26, 2018, the SEC denied an ETF proposed by the Winklevosses in cooperation with BATS Global Market’s BZX stock exchange. Just a day before, the SEC put five ETF decisions on the backburner until September, going on weeks later to delay yet another ETF until the same month, as well.

With its rejection of the Winklevoss ETF, the SEC suggested that bitcoin markets do not feature enough structure or regulatory safeguards to merit approving an ETF, a decision that one commissioner believes sets a disconcerting precedent for playing gatekeeper and signaling to investors which markets it deems as legitimate.

Creating a body to deal with the issue of industry self-regulation should play well with regulators; furthermore, it should also signal to institutional investors that the crypto market is starting to mature and is ready to enter its next phase of growth.

Maria Filipakis was also announced as the VCA interim executive director. Formerly executive deputy superintendent at the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS), Filipakis was key to the drafting and implementation of the New York BitLicense regulations. The body will also have an independent board and a mandate to establish a framework for crypto industry best practices.

John Roth, chief compliance and ethics officer at Bittrex, commented that the new body will improve the credibility of the industry in the eyes of regulators.

“The blockchain industry must focus on protecting its customers and operating in a responsible manner to significantly increase adoption globally. By working with the VCA, we can advance our shared goals of improving transparency, accountability, and security across all virtual currency trading platforms.”",REGULATION,0.4588
2018/8/22,Op Ed: New Bermuda Legislation Will Create a Novel Class of Bank to Service Fintech Companies,"Legislation Is Latest Step to Propel Bermuda’s Fintech Initiative Forward. As we reported on July 19, 2018, Bermuda is determined to establish itself as the leading jurisdiction for fintech entrepreneurs, in particular those involved in initial coin offerings (ICOs), digital assets and virtual currencies. Having recently passed the ICO Act and the Digital Asset Business Act (DABA), Bermuda’s Premier and Minister of Finance, the Hon. E. David Burt, JP, MP, and his cabinet are now focused on creating a new class of bank to facilitate Bermuda’s fintech initiative.

The Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) has spearheaded a new bill, titled the Banks and Deposit Companies Amendment Act 2018 (Restricted Banks Act), that will establish a novel, restricted banking license to encourage banks to provide their services to fintech companies.

This legislation is vital, as to date Bermudian banks have been unwilling to provide banking services to the Island’s nascent fintech startups. The government of Bermuda and the BMA strongly believe that the Restricted Banks Act will resolve this impediment and propel Bermuda’s fintech initiative forward.

The Restricted Banks Act
On July 27, 2018, the House of Assembly passed the Restricted Banks Act and the bill now moves to the Senate for ratification. The government of Bermuda and the BMA designed the Restricted Banks Act to allow international participants to satisfy a critical need for the Island’s fintech companies. Of particular importance are Clauses Two and Three in the Restricted Banks Act.

Clause Two provides that the BMA has broad discretion in regards to the new, restricted banking license. The BMA may impose conditions on or restrict the services that may be provided under the license and may vary or revoke any such condition or restriction. Clause Two also provides that the Minister of Finance, acting on the advice of the BMA, may amend by order the Third Schedule, which specifies the persons to whom banking services may be provided.

Clause Three, which sets forth the Third Schedule, provides that the BMA may authorize banks licensed under the Banks and Deposit Companies Act 1999 to provide banking services to six defined categories of persons. Essentially, the BMA has broad authority to license banks to provide banking services to fintech companies that are licensed under the ICO Act or DABA or that have obtained consent from the Minister of Finance to launch ICOs, as well as to their affiliated companies and to certain of their agents and service providers.

Resolving the Current Impediment to Bermuda’s Fintech Initiative
The Bermuda Bankers’ Association has explained the domestic banks’ reluctance to enter the ICO, digital assets and virtual currency markets, citing their “ongoing need to manage their risks to continue to operate in accordance with their existing correspondent banking relationships.”

Notwithstanding these valid concerns and the Bermudian banks’ general aversion to risk in the wake of the global financial crisis, the Hon. E. David Burt is determined to propel Bermuda’s fintech initiative forward, having declared that Bermuda must evolve and innovate. According to the Premier and Minister of Finance, the reticence of the Bermudian banks cannot be allowed to frustrate Bermuda’s continued economic growth and success.

The Hon. E. David Burt and his Progressive Labour Party believe that the implementation of the Restricted Banks Act will resolve the current impasse, declaring that the bill will “ensure that the government [of Bermuda] is able to effectively execute on its fintech initiatives, as well as encourage responsible fintech innovation that provides fair access to banking services and fair treatment of consumers.”

Importantly, there appears to be key bipartisan support for the Restricted Banks Act. James Jardine, the independent Vice President of the Senate, has stated that, although the fintech industry poses its own idiosyncratic risks, he receives “some degree of comfort” from the BMA’s involvement in the drafting of the Restricted Banks Act.

Ultimately, if Bermuda’s fintech initiative is to be successful, fintech companies will require access to banking services on the Island like any other company authorized to conduct business by the BMA. The Restricted Banks Act should create a banking environment in which such access is possible.

With Increased International Competition for Fintech Business on the Horizon, the Time to Act Is Now
Bermudian fintech companies require access to requisite banking services as soon as possible, as, at this very moment, various other jurisdictions are working to surmount the same hurdle with their respective banking regulators

As is often the case with new technologies and new lines of business, first movers will be well-positioned to attract a lion’s share of the burgeoning fintech market. For example, Bank Frick in Liechtenstein, Fidor Bank in Germany and Bank Vontobel AG in Switzerland have been some of the first banks to service digital asset and virtual currency startups in Europe.

Unsurprisingly, these three banks have begun to siphon fintech business from neighboring European countries, who have been unable or unwilling to provide banking services to fintech companies.

Appreciating the urgency in Bermuda, the Hon. E. David Burt has avowed, “Bermuda must be nimble or we will be left behind.”

Based on this view, the government of Bermuda and the BMA appear to be propelling the Island forward with a prudent and practical new class of banking license that is designed to support the development of the country’s fintech initiative.",REGULATION,0.5267
2018/8/23,China Blocks Access to Over 120 Offshore Digital Currency Exchanges,"China is continuing its crackdown on bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related ventures. The country is now blocking access to more than 120 offshore cryptocurrency exchanges utilized for trading purposes by mainland customers.

In addition, officials are also looking to shut down websites pertaining to both cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs), and to prevent businesses from accepting payments in digital assets.

ICOs were initially banned last September and were described as “unauthorized” and “illegal” fundraising activities. That same month, Chinese regulators ordered all cryptocurrency exchanges within the country to cease trading practices. This caused many ICO and cryptocurrency ventures to pack up their bags and move to the neighboring region of Singapore, which boasts more crypto-friendly regulation.

Over the past year, nearly 90 different cryptocurrency exchanges and about 85 ICOs have been shut down in China. The yuan-bitcoin trading pair has also dropped from 90 percent to less than 5 percent of the world’s total bitcoin trades.

Pan Gongsheng — who heads the Leading Group of Internet Financial Risks Remediation — has been adamant that the cryptocurrency ban in China is the “right decision.”

“If things were still the way they were at the beginning of the year, over 80 percent of the world’s bitcoin trading and ICO financing would take place in China,” he states. “What would things look like today? It’s really quite scary.”

China isn’t stopping with crypto businesses. Officials are also blocking cryptocurrency-related news accounts on social media. The country’s primary social platform WeChat — which currently boasts over one billion users — has allegedly blocked several blockchain and crypto accounts due to suspicions that they were pushing ICO activities. Some of the companies affected by WeChat’s actions include Huobi News, Deepchain and CoinDaily.

A leading group of both social and financial risk prevention and control in the country’s capital of Beijing is also banning digital currency promotion. Recently, the organization issued a notice asking all public retail outlets, such as shopping malls, hotels, office buildings and guest houses, to cease hosting any kind of publicity or promotional activity relating to ICOs and cryptocurrencies.

The news comes after President Xi Jinping induced a sense of optimism amongst Chinese crypto traders when he called blockchain technology a “new industrial revolution” that could benefit both governments and their people.

Meanwhile, the neighboring country of South Korea — which like China, instilled a ban on ICOs and threatened to do the same with cryptocurrency exchanges — has since vied to build a regulated atmosphere for cryptocurrency ventures and platform operators. Officials have also said that they are reconsidering their stance on ICO projects.",REGULATION,-0.91
2018/8/23,U.S. SEC Denies Nine More Bitcoin ETFs,"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) just put nine more bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) on the chopping block.

In three separate orders issued on August 22, 2018, the agency nixed the proposals and contingent rule changes for ETF filings submitted by ProShares, GraniteShares and Direxion. Of these three, five proposals came from Direxion, while GraniteShares and ProShares filed two each.

Unlike past ETF filings, these funds intended to base their data on the bitcoin futures market, not the spot market. Given that the CBOE and CME offer these futures in a regulated trading environment, this structure would seemingly address the SEC’s biggest reservation for approving a bitcoin ETF; namely, that the underlying market is unregulated.

Still, these recent rejections take from the same script as those past. The bitcoin market, the SEC claims, is too loosely structured and lacks protections against fraud and manipulation to merit an exchange traded fund or product.

“... the Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change because, as discussed below, the Exchange has not met its burden under the Exchange Act and the Commission’s Rules of Practice to demonstrate that its proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5), in particular the requirement that a national securities exchange’s rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,” each order reads.

Further rationalizing its decision, the SEC claims that none of the filings offered “evidence to demonstrate that bitcoin futures markets are ‘markets of significant size.’” Market size, the SEC argues, is imperative for establishing “surveillance-sharing with a regulated market... to satisfy the statutory requirement that the Exchange’s rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,” an argument they’ve issued in previous bitcoin ETF rejection orders.

Same News, Different Day
The slew of rejections is unsurprising given the SEC’s track record with similar proposals.

Bitcoin ETF rejections are becoming par for the course, as just last month, the SEC shuttered hopes for the Winklevosses’ second attempt at an ETF, the first attempt coming in March 2017.

Unlike the Winklevoss ETF, which would have based its prices on the bitcoin spot market writ large, these funds were proposing to base their prices on the bitcoin futures markets as provided by the CBOE and CME stock exchanges. As before, though, the SEC still finds that these markets aren’t mature enough to justify an exchange traded product.

The SEC reinforced this belief by quoting a letter it received from the CBOE Futures Exchange President and COO.

“… ‘the current bitcoin futures trading volumes on Cboe Futures Exchange and CME may not currently be sufficient to support ETPs seeking 100% long or short exposure to bitcoin,’” the excerpt reads.

“These statements reinforce the Commission’s conclusion that there is insufficient evidence to determine that the CME and CFE bitcoin futures markets are markets of significant size,” the SEC continued.

With its decision, the SEC reinforced that its “disapproval does not rest on an evaluation of whether bitcoin, or blockchain technology more generally, has utility or value as an innovation or an investment,” an argument it has made before.

Hester Peirce, an SEC commissioner appointed this January, however, believes that the SEC’s past decision tacitly makes this judgement call on behalf of American investors. In a recent interview with Bitcoin Magazine, she said that the Winklevoss ETF rejection was “not a great precedent,” arguing that it puts the SEC into a gatekeeper role for what is and isn’t a legitimate asset.

“It plays into a bit of a thread in securities regulations — at the federal and at the state level — which is that there’s an inclination among regulators to almost step into the shoes of the investor and say whether or not the investor should be making that particular decision, based on our assessment of the actual product — in this case, the actual asset. So yes, that is a disturbing precedent, because I can’t make assessments about those things.”

By the end of September, the SEC will issue orders on another round of ETFs after delaying its decision earlier this month.",REGULATION,-0.4215
2018/8/28,Canada Delays Regulation of Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain Companies,"The Canadian government has postponed the release of its final regulations for cryptocurrency and blockchain companies. The final published regulations were due this fall, but the government now says they won’t be published in the Canada Gazette until late 2019.

Because the federal government is already in pre-election mode ahead of the 2019 election, the final cryptocurrency or “virtual currency” regulations have effectively been put on hold, leaving the current regulatory regime in place until well into 2020, as there is an additional 12-month period after publication for any new regulations to take effect.

Some companies in the space see this as a positive for the industry’s competitiveness as the government is effectively backing away from the stricter rules proposed in the draft version published in June 2018.

Others are concerned that this delay will harm their competitive position in the quickly growing international crypto market, where countries like Switzerland and Malta are actively encouraging crypto businesses with few regulations and a favorable tax regime.

The Blockchain Association of Canada (BAC) told Bitcoin Magazine that it appreciates that the government is proceeding with caution, in recognition of the complexities of this new, evolving sector.

“The decision to delay the proposed regulations bodes well for the Canadian blockchain and cryptocurrency space. The government is committed to an innovation agenda and sometimes … it may be best to observe and intervene as little as possible,” said BAC Executive Director Kyle Kemper.

Large Volume of Submissions From the Crypto Sector
According to a number of participants, the sheer volume and quality of the comments and responses by the industry to the proposed regulatory package likely contributed to the government's decision to hold off on publishing until next year.

Cryptocurrencies and blockchain companies and organizations, like the Money Services Business Association, were invited to submit comments and attend meetings with Finance Canada officials.

BRI Calls for a Central Regulatory Body Comparable to the SEC
One set of comments submitted to the federal finance department included a report from the influential Toronto-based Blockchain Research Institute (BRI).

The BRI assembled a round table of 70 participants from the industry and submitted a report with carefully thought out, detailed recommendations.

The report says there’s substantive regulatory work that needs to be done to create certainty and build a competitive industry, although the participants called for a middle ground, saying:

“... as the blockchain revolution unfolds, regulators would be wise to avoid the chainsaw when microsurgery could do. To be sure, we do not want the Wild West.”

The BRI report points out that Canada is the only developed federal democracy that does not have a securities regulatory authority at the federal government level and recommends creating a central regulatory body at the federal level like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Instead, “ten provinces, three territories, and the federal government all juggle responsibility for ensuring capital market functions efficiently and honestly — attempting to keep a watchful eye on issuers, investors, investment dealers and other market players.”

“This model was set up to oversee a much simpler world where there were actual traders on stock exchange floors, and where the pace of innovation in capital markets was glacial and regionally confined,” adds the report.

Continuing Uncertainty in the Crypto Sector
Coinsquare Exchange CEO Cole Diamond, as a member of the BRI’s Advisory Committee, made the case for more regulatory clarity. He told Bitcoin Magazine:

“I don’t think that delaying regulatory clarity is a good thing. At the same time, I understand how complex this market is. The regulators are still learning, and I can assure everyone that they are trying.”

“My hat goes off to the OSC Launchpad, the Ministry of Finance and others for their focus on the market. We look forward to continuing to work with them to bring about opportunities for Canadian businesses to lead globally in this exciting space.”

Evan Thomas, a Toronto-based lawyer working with crypto startups on regulations and compliance, also thinks that there needs to be some serious work done on regulating cryptocurrencies and blockchain companies.

Thomas told Bitcoin Magazine:

“Delay can put Canadian businesses at a competitive disadvantage. Other jurisdictions are moving more quickly to establish regulatory frameworks around crypto, to the extent those frameworks don't already exist.

“Until the regulations are final, it will be challenging for Canadian crypto businesses to establish critical banking and other relationships because many financial sector players are waiting for a regulatory framework to be in place. The longer the delay, the harder it may be for the industry to grow in the meantime.”

Amber D. Scott, founder of compliance consultancy Outlier Solutions Inc., is pleased that the government “is taking feedback from stakeholder groups seriously.”

Scott told Bitcoin Magazine that “for the time being, things stay as they are. We advise companies to start thinking about the resources that they will need to deploy when the final version is published but to wait for that version to deploy development because things are likely to change at some point.”

In Thomas’s view, this delay will hurt companies in the space, some of whom will go ahead anyway to regulate themselves. He noted that “Canadian crypto businesses are implementing compliance programs even when not legally required because financial partners require them or for general risk management. The longer the delay, the more costly it may be to re-work those programs to meet the final regulations.”",REGULATION,0.9981
2018/8/30,"As Venezuela Takes Aim at Remittances, Bitcoiners Take Collateral Damage","The Venezuelan government is cracking down on remittance payments with a new banking mandate, one that could put the country’s Bitcoin users on an even tighter leash.

In a letter “addressed to all banking institutions,” the government has ordered all domestic banks to disclose the IP addresses, financial details, transaction amounts and locations of all citizens who access their banking services from outside the country.

Per the measure, Venezuelans are expected to “notify [their] banking institution of [travel] instances prior to [departing], explicitly indicating their destination place(s)” and how long they’ll be out of country, the letter reads.

If a citizen fails to comply with the above stipulations, banks may “enact a special condition that restricts the ability of the client to make online transactions,” effectively locking them out of their bank accounts if they are caught accessing services outside of the county. The bank is then required to “report the policy holder’s name; identification of the resource/asset; date and place of provenance; date of imposed restriction and the IP address from which access was attempted” to the National Entity of Financial Intelligence.

“Lack of compliance with the above stated,” the letter concludes, “will result in the imposing of sanctions in accordance with the terms outlined by the legislative decree.”

An Attempt to Monopolize Money Transfers
The measure, self-described as a means to “preserve the interests of the users and of the general public,” is the government’s attempt to strongarm the community of Venezuelans who migrate to neighboring countries, such as Argentina, to send money home. Their own country’s economy ravaged by hyperinflation, these expats seek work abroad in hopes of earning a living wage to support themselves and their loved ones.

It’s these citizens funneling money back into the country that the government wants to police with its new order.

“A lot of people are sending money to their relatives in Venezuela and they want a cut of that,” Venezuelan Eduardo Gómez, head of support at Purse.io, told Bitcoin Magazine. This strategy, he continued to explain, is much like the Cuban government’s own monopoly over cross-border transaction clearing.

“If you look at what Cuba is doing … the biggest revenue source for Cuba is remittances; it’s all the Cubans living in Florida, in Miami, sending money home to their families. If you want to send money to Cuba, you have to go through the government to sell dollars for Cuban pesos.”

Venezuelan officials are reaching for the same control. In sanctioning state-approved trading houses, which as Gómez suggests are in the government’s back pocket, politicians are hoping to reroute all remittances through these institutions to take a cut of payments. The bank order is the means by which the government intends to coerce citizens to use these services.

And their IP addresses are the leverage. As the order indicates, if a client is caught accessing online banking services abroad, or she fails to report the required information to her bank, then that client could lose banking privileges.

Gómez told us that the government has already come down on citizens using middleman services who offer cheaper money transfer services in neighboring countries, citing his siblings’ use of such services in Uruguay.

This new measure will look to sweep up those they’ve missed, including users of well-known OTC Bitcoin exchange LocalBitcoins.

With Remittances in Sight, Bitcoin Users Caught in Crossfire
“Bitcoin is a threat to [the government] because people are using LocalBitcoins to trade money around,” Gómez said.

While Gómez admitted that there’s less volume on Latin America’s LocalBitcoins hubs compared to international exchange volumes, he did say that “volume is increasing,” as it has become a popular remittance option to circumvent government-sanctioned trading houses.

Expats will even use the service as an alternative to foreign currency transfer intermediaries. Many Venezuelans living and working in Argentina, for example, will convert their Argentinian pesos into bitcoin. Using LocalBitcoins, they’ll search for a Venezuelan trader who uses the same bank as them, something that can be tricky depending on rates, bitcoin-to-bolivar liquidity and transaction size. Once a user finds the right match, they’ll give the buyer their bank account number — or, in some situations, that of a relative — and settle the transaction.

Under the government’s new requirements, Venezuelans who deposit directly into their own bank accounts could be in trouble, Gómez said, as they could have their banking services shuttered on account of illegal use — with similar consequences for those buyers transferring the funds. If the measure takes its desired effect, Gómez believes that it could have damaging  ramifications on Bitcoin’s use and LocalBitcoins’s presence among Venezuelans.

“What this means for Bitcoin in the short term is that it could take some liquidity from LocalBitcoins because I have heard some rumors that a lot of Latin American traders for LocalBitcoins are Venezuelans living abroad. A lot of these guys left the country years ago, so what may happen is that a lot of those traders won’t be able to log into their bank accounts.”

Theoretically, this is easy to overcome. Instead of transferring funds into your own account, for instance, you could have them sent to a relative, instead. Gómez forecasts this as a likely outcome — one that, if it causes an uptick in LocalBitcoins’s popularity, could lead the government to shut down domestic access to the platform entirely.

“In the long term, the government may restrict LocalBitcoins via something like DNS blocking or IP blocking to restrict access to LocalBitcoins in Venezuela. If they see that a lot of people are using LocalBitcoins to circumvent this IP restriction, then they may see it as a threat.”

Still, this action would be a long time coming if it’s ever executed, Gómez predicts, for the same reason why LocalBitcoins is the only cryptocurrency exchange still active in the country: officials use it.

“A lot of people inside the government use LocalBitcoins to sell their bitcoins that they earn via mining because all of the government officials mine,” he said.

Even as the Venezuelan police raid local mining operations, government officials themselves mine with immunity, having bootstrapped their own rigs since the market’s 2017 bull run. Seeing as it’s so popular among officials, Gómez thinks the government will leave the exchange alone — for now, at least.

Bigger Than Bitcoin
In our talk, Gómez indicated that the government’s banking order will no doubt create headaches for Venezuelan Bitcoin users. But by and large, the order is about effecting greater control over all aspects of the economy. Wrangling in Bitcoin users, specifically those sending money across borders, is just one degree of this control.

“Ultimately, the government wants a cut of the pie for remittances,” Gómez said.

LocalBitcoins is certainly cutting into the government’s transaction processing profit, but it’s not only used for money transfers. Gómez also told Bitcoin Magazine that Venezuelans use the service to check the bolivar’s rate against the U.S. dollar, which has become a de facto trading standard for many in-country services.

Venezuelans used to reference DolarToday, a popular service for transparent bolivar-dollar rates. But ever since rumors began to spread that the Venezuelan government covertly purchased the domain to control the rates, “LocalBitcoins is becoming the market reference for the dollar,” Gómez said. Users will refer to the bitcoin-bolivar rate against the bitcoin-dollar rate to arrive at a reliable bolivar-dollar rate.

The government’s economic war, as Gómez indicated, is total — one that looks to tighten the noose around any service or tender that works around officially sanctioned services. Given LocalBitcoins is proving to be a multifaceted tool for those Venezuelans who use it, it’s reasonable to assume that, if its popularity continues to surge, the government may take action.

If it does, this could completely throttle the last access points Venezuelans have to cryptocurrency platforms and services. Gómez said that even though LocalBitcoins is the only operable exchange left in the country, “there’s [still] a lack of liquidity.”

In the event of this closing, Venezuelans will have yet another hurdle to jump when attempting to use crypto; this would neutralize one of the only economic safe havens citizens have left as the bolivar continues to hemorrhage value.

“Venezuelan salaries are so low that there’s not even a way for people to buy crypto. To put things into perspective, the average salary in Venezuela for one month of work is $1. Can you imagine that? Working a full month and only earning $1 at the end of it,” Gómez concluded in our talk.

2018/9/5,"Abra CEO Believes Bitcoin ETF Eminent, SEC Just Needs the Right Suitor","Bill Barhydt, founder of bitcoin wallet app Abra, said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would approve a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) within a year once the financial regulator feels comfortable with the caliber of the applicants.

A bitcoin ETF would allow investors to purchase bitcoin through funds listed on a regulated, legacy stock exchange. Like the bitcoin futures contracts that came before it, a bitcoin ETF is seen by many as the bridge that will encourage institutional investors to cross over to the emerging crypto market.

Speaking on CNBC's The Coin Rush, Barhydt said the SEC’s refusal to approve any bitcoin ETF application is down to the individuals filing them, who he claims ""don't fit the mold"" of those the SEC is “used to approving.""

Barhydt seems to suggest that in order for an exchange or financial organization to receive approval for a bitcoin ETF, the entity has to be one that ""looks, feels and smells"" like something that the SEC is accustomed to.

""I used to work for Goldman Sachs, but if you look at how I'm dressed you probably wouldn't know it. So I probably, unfortunately, couldn't go like I am here to a meeting at the SEC to say I'm applying for the ability to issue an ETF,"" he added.

He believes, however, that the SEC will approve a bitcoin ETF next year as there is just too ""much demand for it"" from the community.

""It's going to happen in the next year; I would actually make a bet on it,"" he noted.

Barhydt's comments come on the heels of a statement made by Dan Morehead, CEO of Pantera Capital, who said a bitcoin ETF approval will take ""quite a long time,"" as cryptocurrency adoption is still in its infancy. Morehead also advised investors to focus on bullish news such as the launch of ICE's digital platform for bitcoin futures.

Applications for ETFs have been met with resistance at every turn. The SEC has rejected two funds proposed by the Winklevoss Twins, extended its decision period on the listing of the VanEck/SolidX fund until September 30, 2018, and shot down a host of other funds filed by ProShares, GraniteShares and Direxion. This last round of rejections, however, is pending review by the SEC’s higher-ups, as the decision was made at the staffing level and has been picked up for review by the Commission itself.",REGULATION,0.5896
2018/9/10,U.S. SEC Suspends Trading for Two Swedish-Based Crypto ETNs,"Two securities, one that tracks bitcoin and another that tracks the cryptocurrency ether, have been temporarily halted by a U.S. regulatory watchdog due to investor confusion.

Starting September 9, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has suspended all U.S. trading of Bitcoin Tracker One (CXBTF) and Ether Tracker One (CETHF) until September 20, 2018. The exchange-traded notes (ETNs) are issued by Swedish company XBT Provider AB, a subsidiary of U.K.-based CoinShares Holdings.

Per the order, U.S. brokers are barred from trading the ETNs “for any purpose other than to facilitate sales of instruments owned by non-broker customers...” Essentially, this means that broker-dealers can only help their clients to exit these markets to liquidate their positions, while all other trading activity is prohibited until the order expires.  

With a caution to “broker-dealers, shareholders and prospective purchasers” to “carefully consider … any information subsequently issued by [XBT Provider AB],” the SEC cited investor confusion as a primary reason for restricting investor access to the products.

The confusion is over sales and marketing materials that characterized the products as the more stringently-regulated exchange-traded funds (ETFs), when in fact, they are exchange-traded notes (ETNs), according to the order.

Both types of securities are similar in that they allow investors to participate in the market without having to purchase the physical commodity. The primary difference comes down to risk. An ETF is similar to a stock in that the issuer holds the asset it tracks, whereas an ETN is more like a bond in that it is an unsecured debt. Yet, because ETNs are structured investment products issued by a major bank, as opposed to an asset pool, they come with a lower level of risk.  

Bitcoin Tracker One started trading on the Nasdaq Stockholm Exchange in 2015, and Ether Tracker One launched in October 2017.

Bitcoin Tracker One was listed in U.S. dollars for the first time in August 2018, making it easier for brokerages to offer the securities to American investors. Previous to that, investors could only buy into the Swedish ETN product using euros or Swedish kora.

The trading suspension is the latest in the SEC’s increasingly busy engagement with the cryptocurrency industry. In July 2018, the SEC rejected a second attempted ETF filing by the Winklevosses. The following month, it denied nine bitcoin ETF filings at the staff level, but then the Commission decided to review these rejections and re-evaluate the proposals, a move that gave the industry a glint of optimism in a hitherto fruitless effort to secure the institutional-grade product for U.S. markets.",REGULATION,0.4491
2018/9/11,"Two-for-One: SEC Slaps Crypto Hedge Fund, Broker With Registration Failures","In what it deems a first for both enforcement actions, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is charging two entities with registration failures.

First in line, TokenLot LLC, the self-named “ICO Superstore,” is being charged with acting as an unregistered broker-dealer in the “first case charging unregistered broker-dealers for selling digital tokens after the SEC issued The DAO Report in 2017.” A seminal document in defining ICOs and tokens as securities, the DAO Report was released in July of 2017 and classified DAO tokens as unregistered securities following the infamous 2016 hack.

In “its first-ever enforcement action finding an investment company registration violation by a hedge fund manager based on its investments in digital assets,” the SEC has also charged Crypto Asset Management LP (CAM) with operating as an unregistered investment company while falsely branding itself as the “first regulated crypto asset fund in the United States.”

CAM and its sole manager Timothy Enneking reportedly raised over $3.6 million in 2017 by providing illegal investment management services. The company also facilitated “an unregistered non-exempt public offering” and invested roughly 40 percent of its funds in cryptocurrencies, but, upon facing action from the SEC, CAM terminated the public offering and instituted a buyback for its investors. In addition, Enneking acquiesced to the SEC’s censure and agreed to pay a fine of $200,000 without confirming or denying the charges.

Facing its own pressure from the regulatory agency, TokenLot and its principals, Lenny Kugel and Eli Lewitt, paid $471,000 in disgorgement with $7,929 in interest, agreeing to “retain an independent third party to destroy TokenLot’s remaining inventory of digital assets.”

“Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings,” the agency claims, Kugel and Lewitt will each pay individual fines of $45,000 and have “agreed to industry and penny stock bars and an investment company prohibition with the right to reapply after three years.”

These penalties come after TokenLot handled funds from more than 6,100 clients and managed over 200 different cryptocurrencies in the process. Its business model operated under trading profits and taking “a percentage of the money that TokenLot raised for ICOs.” The majority of the Michigan-based company’s trading activity took place after the DAO Report was released, ceasing in February 2018.

“U.S. securities laws protect investors by subjecting broker-dealers and other gatekeepers to SEC oversight, including those offering ICOs and secondary trading in digital tokens,” Stephanie Avakian, co-director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division said in the press release regarding TokenLot. “We continue to encourage those developing digital asset trading businesses to contact the SEC staff at FinTech@sec.gov for assistance in analyzing registration and other securities law requirements.”

Earlier today, FINRA, the SEC’s self-regulatory complement in the private sector, filed a complaint against Timothy Tilton Ayre for “the unlawful distribution of an unregistered cryptocurrency security called HempCoin,” in conjunction with his publicly traded company, Rocky Mountain Ayre. Both cases are emblematic of how the largely unregulated cryptocurrency industry continues to grapple with formal regulatory organizations as its popularity increases.",REGULATION,-0.4588
2018/9/11,A New Precedent: FINRA Charges Crypto Broker With Securities Fraud,"The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a non-profit watchdog for public brokerage firms in the U.S., has had its first run-in with the cryptocurrency industry. The self-regulatory organization is filing a complaint against a Massachusetts man for “the unlawful distribution of an unregistered cryptocurrency security called HempCoin.”

Timothy Tilton Ayre, FINRA alleges, illegally associated sales in his publicly traded company, Rocky Mountain Ayre Inc. (RMTN), with the marijuana industry token. Allegedly purchasing the rights to HempCoin in June of 2015, Ayre rebranded the coin as an RMNT-backed security, FINRA’s complaint states.

According to FINRA, Ayre attempted to market his “worthless” company and sell shares through HempCoin by advertising the cryptocurrency as “the first minable coin backed by marketable securities.” Heralding HempCoin as “the world’s first currency to represent equity ownership” in a public company, Ayre reportedly guaranteed that each token represented 0.10 shares in RMTN.

Since Ayre never registered HempCoin with the SEC, FINRA is charging him with “unlawful distribution of an unregistered security.” Moreover, the self-regulatory body accuses Ayre of defrauding investors “by making materially false statements and omissions regarding the nature of RMTN’s business, failing to disclose his creation and unlawful distribution of HempCoin, and making multiple false and misleading statements in RMTN’s financial statements.”

FINRA explains in its statement that the filing does not constitute legal action. As “an initiation of a formal proceeding,” Ayre can respond to the filing by requesting a formal disciplinary hearing. In the event that Ayre’s defense doesn’t hold up and he’s found guilty, he could be fined, censured, suspended or barred from the securities industry; relieved of his gains; and/or forced to pay reparations to investors.

The filing is the first action taken by a self-regulatory industry against an individual involved in the cryptocurrency industry, and it’s the first time FINRA has engaged with a securities dispute directly relating to the cryptocurrency market.

That said, formal regulators have wrestled with the unregistered sale of securities before, even outright scams. Both FINRA and the SEC’s reckoning with token projects and the sometimes unscrupulous actors who promote them continues to insert itself into the debate on the distinction between utility/security tokens and the merit of cryptocurrency regulations.

2018/9/18,Cryptocurrency Exchanges Fall Short in Safeguarding Funds: Report,"In April 2018, former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sent off inquiries to more than a dozen cryptocurrency exchanges to learn more about their internal operations. Now, after months of investigation, the New York Attorney General’s office has made its findings public.

A report titled “Virtual Markets Integrity Initiative,” released on Tuesday, September 18, 2018, confirms what many already know to be true: Many cryptocurrency exchanges do not have proper consumer protections in place and are often targets for market manipulation.

The questionnaire originally went out to 13 crypto exchanges. Ten voluntarily complied with the study, but four did not respond, arguing they did not serve customers in New York. But, after investigating three of those non-responders, the New York Attorney General’s office “referred Binance, Gate.io, and Kraken to the Department of Financial Services for potential violation of New York’s virtual currency regulations.”

Kraken, the only one of the four based in the U.S., was the most vociferous in its refusal to respond to the inquiry, calling the initial request “ill-prepared” and “an overly broad fishing expedition that asks questions irrelevant to the stated objective and misses obvious questions that actually would be helpful.”

Report Highlights
The report highlights three broad areas of concern.

First, exchanges dabble in several lines of business that would normally be carefully monitored in a traditional trading environment. Platforms often simultaneously offer a venue of exchange, perform a role similar to broker-dealers, and act as money transmitters. At the same time, many also have their own large crypto holdings and even issue their own cryptocurrencies.

“Each role has a markedly different set of incentives, introducing substantial potential for conflicts between the interests of the platform, platform insiders and platform customers,” the report states. As an example, the report points out that exchange employees often trade on their own platforms, even though they may have access to information about future trades or upcoming coin listing.

Second, the report claims that many exchanges make little or no effort to halt abusive trading activities. “Platforms lack robust real-time and historical market surveillance capabilities, like those found in traditional trading venues, to identify and stop suspicious trading patterns,” the report says.

What is more, there is often no way to monitor suspicious trading across multiple platforms, and “few platforms seriously restrict or even monitor the operation of ‘bots,’” the report states. “Those factors, coupled with the concentration of virtual currency in the hands of a relatively small number of major traders, leave the platforms highly susceptible to abuse.”  

Finally, the report argues that safeguards for customers funds are “often limited or illusory.” Exchanges lack a consistent approach to third-party audits that serve to show that exchanges own the coins or fiat money they claim to hold. “That makes it difficult or impossible to confirm whether platforms are responsibly holding their customers’ virtual assets as claimed.”  

Concerns over market manipulation in cryptocurrency exchanges have been popping up again and again. In thinly traded markets, it becomes very easy for so-called “whales” or large holders to move the price of bitcoin, or any cryptocurrency, in whatever directly they want.

The report comes at a time when the U.S. Justice Department is investigating crypto market manipulation, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rejected numerous bids for bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the basis that cryptocurrency markets are simply too vulnerable to fraud and manipulation.

2018/9/20,Congressional Committee Calls for Clearer Crypto Tax Code in Letter to IRS,"In an open letter to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the U.S. House’s Committee on Ways and Means argues that the tax collection body is leaving investors in the lurch with its vague cryptocurrency tax codes.

Authored by congressional representatives Kevin Brady, Lynn Jenkins, Darin LaHood, David Schweikert and Brad Wenstrup, the letter, addressed to Acting Commissioner David Kautter, calls on the IRS to devise a more concrete cryptocurrency taxing scheme than the one it currently enforces.

Opening with reference to a similar letter the Committee sent to the IRS on May 17, 2017, the lawmakers opine that, more than a year later, the IRS has done little to guide taxpayers through the process of paying capital gains taxes on their cryptocurrency investments, even though it’s been ramping up enforcement all the while.

“... the IRS continues to expand its enforcement activities without issuing any further guidance for taxpayers. We, therefore, write again today to strongly urge the IRS to issue updated guidance, providing additional clarity for taxpayers seeking to better understand and comply with their tax obligations when using virtual currencies,” the letter reads.

It continues to argue that, since the inception of bitcoin, the IRS has “struggled” to formulate a taxation strategy to accommodate cryptocurrencies. Noting that the agency said cryptocurrencies would be taxed as property in 2014, something the IRS Commissioner at the time called “preliminary guidance,” the lawmakers claim that “to date, the IRS has not issued any additional guidance that taxpayers may rely upon to better understand their tax obligations.”

And the legislators state that they are not alone in their concerns. Since 2016, the letter indicates, multiple organizations have contributed to the conversation, alluding to calls-to-action by The Association of International Certified Professional Accountants, the American Bar Association and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration for the IRS “to develop a comprehensive virtual currency tax strategy.”

The authors state that the IRS, despite lack of a clear strategy, has made cryptocurrency taxation a focal point of enforcement. In 2016, for instance, the agency issued Coinbase a John Doe Summons to collect information on nearly half a million Americans who invested in cryptocurrencies from 2013 to 2015. In addition to this action, in July of 2018, it launched a campaign to target those who have not complied with its mandates.

By failing to help investors properly navigate new ground, the letter draws the conclusion that the IRS “severely hinders taxpayers' ability to [comply].” As such, it calls for “the IRS to expeditiously issue more robust guidance clarifying taxpayer obligations,” arguing the agency has had “more than adequate time” to do so.

In its final paragraphs, the letter requests that the agency provide the Committed additional information toward this end no later than October 17, 2018. It also states that the Committee will request the Government Office of Accountability to audit the situation to glean a better understanding of the matter.",REGULATION,0.951
2018/9/20,“Someone’s Got to Be the Voice of Reason” — Kraken Responds to NY AG Report,"The New York Attorney General’s office has pointed a finger at cryptocurrency exchange Kraken for “potential” violation of state regulations. Now, the San Francisco–based exchange is firing back, saying it does not appreciate what it sees as implications of illegality.

“Someone has to be the voice of reason,” Jesse Powell, Kraken’s outspoken co-founder and CEO, told Bitcoin Magazine. “If we all accept corrupt practices as the norm, without saying anything out of fear of unlawful retaliation, what the hell are we doing this for?”

In April 2018, as part of its Virtual Markets Integrity Initiative, the New York Attorney General’s office sent out a voluntary questionnaire to 13 exchanges as part of a “fact-finding inquiry.” Kraken and three other exchanges chose not to respond.

“If you want to talk to us, ask us for a phone call, fly yourself out to San Francisco, invite us for lunch at your office,” Powell said.

Fast-forward five months and the New York Attorney General’s office has now issued its report on the results of the questionnaire. Within the report is a paragraph stating that the office has “referred Binance, Gate.io, and Kraken to the Department of Financial Services for potential violation of New York’s virtual currency regulations.” The implication was that Kraken could still be allowing New York residents to trade on its platform without a proper license.

Three years ago, New York instituted a requirement that any company dealing with cryptocurrency in the state must have a BitLicense. Rather than apply for one, Kraken, based in New York at the time, hit the road, calling the law “a creature so foul, so cruel that not even Kraken possesses the courage or strength to face its nasty, big, pointy teeth.”

Now, safely tucked 3,000 miles away in the Bay State, Kraken still feels haunted by the Big Apple.NY is that abusive, controlling ex you broke up with 3 years ago but they keep stalking you, throwing shade on your new relationships, unable to accept that you have happily moved on and are better off without them. After reading the New York Attorney General’s entire 42-page report, Powell asserts that there isn’t “any mention of evidence that we are still doing business with NY residents.” (In fact, the report mentions Kraken only twice, both times on page 2.) Instead, it appears that the New York Attorney General is tossing the matter over the wall to the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to see if they can come up with anything.

Powell doubts they will. “We recently spoke to NYDFS; they are aware we are not serving New York,” he said.

Kraken uses a five-tiered system to identify clients. Tier 0, verified by email only, lets clients enter the site and poke around. If clients want to trade cryptocurrency, per Tier 1 requirements, they have to supply “full name, date of birth, country and phone number.”

At Tier 1, the exchange “does not collect identity documents,” Powell says, but it does do other checks, like look up a person’s IP address to deduce their location and verify phone and address. “If any of our checks fail or our info indicates that the user is in a prohibited geo, they are required to provide identity documents and undergo enhanced scrutiny,” he said.

Powell thinks the Attorney General’s report was good in that it highlighted important questions consumers should be asking exchanges. However, he thinks calling out the exchanges who chose not to respond to the questionnaire unnecessary.

“After all,” he said, “there are hundreds more exchanges which were never asked and are not named.”

Regulatory clarity in the U.S. is important to the growth of the cryptocurrency industry — as long as that regulation is reasonable, he said. “We operate in a global market and regulators must be careful not to stifle domestic business while giving foreign businesses a competitive advantage.”

As for Kraken, Powell claims his exchange operates with high standards. “Much of what the regulators imagine should be done is already being done voluntarily,” he said. “We push back only where we have a strong view that the regulator is getting the issue wrong, and where the consumer might actually be put in a worse position, or where a government agency is dramatically overstepping bounds.”

Powell summed up: Although Kraken is happy to work with regulators and law enforcement, “we will not stand by silently while rights are trampled on.”

Regardless, calling out regulators, who tend to wield a lot of power in the space, is a bold move for an exchange contemplating listing 1,600 new coins.",REGULATION,0.9317
2018/9/22,U.S. Congressman Drafts Blockchain Development Bills,"The newly elected co-chair of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, U.S. Representative Tom Emmer, has introduced a trio of blockchain-focused bills in support of the development and use of blockchain technology and digital assets. According to an official announcement, the bills focus on fostering government support for the blockchain space, clarifying money transmitter regulations and devising a tax scheme for hard forked assets.

A statement from Emmer reads in part:

“The United States should prioritize accelerating the development of blockchain technology and create an environment that enables the American private sector to lead on innovation and further growth.”

He went on to add that legislators need to do more by “embracing emerging technologies” and providing the regulatory framework needed for these technologies to succeed in the U.S.

Resolution Supporting Digital Currencies and Blockchain Technology
The first bill expresses support for blockchain technology and calls for a “light-touch regulatory approach” so it can flourish. The bill also highlights some of the benefits of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, such as how it enables value transfer between users and the provision of financial services to those underserved by the traditional financial sector.

Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act
The second bill focuses on cryptocurrency miners, and clarifies who needs to register as a money transmitter in the U.S. The bill designates miners and multisig-wallet providers as blockchain entities that don’t require a money transmitter license to operate in the United States as they don’t control consumer funds.

Safe Harbor for Taxpayers with Forked Assets Act
In the absence of regulatory guidelines, the third and final bill seeks to create a “safe harbor for the tax treatment of hard forks of convertible virtual currency.” The bill would shield taxpayers from being levied any fine by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) until such time as the IRS provides clear guidance on how such gains should be reported.

Emmer’s proposals are the first blockchain-related bills to call for regulatory clarity and greater legislative engagement with the industry, and they come on the heels of Emmer's being named co-chair of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, alongside fellow Representative Bill Foster.  The Congressional Blockchain Caucus is a bipartisan group of pro-blockchain legislators “who believe in the future of blockchain technology, and understand that Congress has a role to play in its development.”",REGULATION,0.994
2018/9/27,"Crypto Task Force Bill Passes House of Representatives, Moves to Senate","A bill that seeks to create a task force to combat the use of cryptocurrency in financing terrorism has just passed the House of Representatives. House Resolution 5036 (H.R.5036), which purports to establish the ""Independent Financial Technology Task Force,"" was sent to the House of Representatives on Wednesday, September 26, 2018, before it passed an unanimous voice vote and has now moved to the Senate for consideration.

The proposed bill, which was introduced by Representative Ted Budd, is seen as a positive move from U.S. lawmakers, which aims to mitigate the use of cryptocurrencies in terrorist financing. The task force would focus on researching the ways in which terrorism could be financed through cryptos and propose actions to curb such activity.

In addition to the creation of the task force, the bill would also support the development of tools and programs to detect any illicit use of cryptocurrency.

Public records from Congress indicate that the bill was passed by the House without contention. Seeing as the vote was unanimous and the bill wasn't a controversial one, the motion to reconsider was laid upon the table and gavelled out, so it will now procede to a vote in the Senate.

In addition to having federal law enforcement studying cryptocurrencies and how terrorists are exploiting them, the bill also proposes rewards for those who provide information that leads to the conviction of those involved in crypto terrorism financing. These rewards will be paid out from the funds seized from convicts, as well as from related fines and forfeitures.

H.R.5036 is seen by many as a more robust version of another cryptocurrency-related bill. Released earlier last year, the House of Representatives introduced the ""Homeland Security Assessment of Terrorists Use of Virtual Currencies Act"" which seeks to make a proper threat assessment on the use of cryptocurrencies by terrorists.

One of the talking points of the Act is the way it defines virtual currencies. It defines virtual currencies as any digital representation of value functioning as a medium of exchange, store of value or a unit of account. This broad definition includes bitcoin, ether, a virtual debit card and even a Paypal balance.",REGULATION,-0.9452
2018/10/3,Bitcoin Foundation Challenges “French BitLicense” Proposed in PACTE Bill,"On September 23, 2018, the Bitcoin Foundation sent a letter to the French Parliament asking that they reject a new crypto asset amendment being proposed in the PACTE Bill, which deals with the growth and transformation of France’s businesses and the country’s employee savings.

The amendment was suggested by members of France’s new social liberal party La Republique En Marche (LREM) on September 21, 2018. Should the amendment pass, it would allow the French government to adopt the recommendations of what’s known as the Landau report, a proponent of New York’s BitLicense.

Llew Claasen is the executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation. Speaking with Bitcoin Magazine, he states that the amendment is wrong for France and will leave the country behind when it comes to technological advancement in the blockchain and crypto space.

“The amendment seeks to introduce a licensing requirement for any provider of digital asset services, with digital assets being very widely defined to include any crypto asset that would not already be regulated as a financial instrument, including for non-financial use cases,” he explains.

“The licensing regime described is arbitrary and far-reaching, offering no certainty around how the regulator will determine what would be needed to get a license, keep a license or even how long it would take to get a license. Additionally, the summary suggests than an important reason for the creation of the regulations is anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing when there is no reason to suggest that crypto assets are used in that way at any meaningful scale.”

Claasen says that New York’s BitLicense has destroyed both fair competition and blockchain innovation within the state. He is concerned that France will experience the same results if the amendment garners majority approval.

“Since the BitLicense was introduced in New York in August 2015, only seven licenses have been issued, all of them to large, well-funded organizations,” he states. “An entire industry packed up and moved out of New York after the BitLicense was promulgated, and it will happen in France.”

Claasen is adamant that the country — and Europe, in general — doesn’t need new crypto regulation, but rather a light hand and guidance notes from regulators that describe desirable market behavior. He says blockchain technology is too new and immature, and that its final use cases and best practices are too uncertain to force it into a rigid licensing regime. He believes regulators need to spend more time understanding how the technology works before they can make any valid decisions regarding how it should be officiated.

“Most blockchain products will tend toward a decentralized, private, peer-to-peer state including the absence of a sponsor, a reporting entity or a governing body,” he states.

“Many crypto-specific regulations assume that the centralized transitionary states of these projects reflect their end state, and that these networks can be regulated in the same way that one might regulate a juridical or natural person. They can’t, even if we’d like them to be. These networks are a completely different way of coordinating economic activity that seeks to be more scalable, but we need more time to figure things out. Bad behavior by some predatory market participants should not be taken as a signal to snuff out all development in this space.”

Founded in September 2012, the Bitcoin Foundation has sought to bring top figures in the crypto community together to build awareness regarding bitcoin’s benefits, uses and requirements for global adoption, although it has been somewhat out of the spotlight in recent years. Members are now asking French cryptocurrency experts to reach out and assist in establishing the organization’s presence in the country and bring an early end to the proposed amendment.",REGULATION,0.0772

In his letter, Eich describes GDPR as a “great leveler” and says it has allowed many new businesses in Europe to flourish by preventing larger, more established corporations from disadvantaging them.

“The GDPR’s principle of ‘purpose limitation’ will begin to prevent dominant platforms from using data that they have collected for one purpose at one end of their business to the benefit of other parts of their business in a way that currently disadvantages new entrants,” Eich writes.

“In general, platform giants will need ‘opt-in’ consent for each purpose for which they want to use consumers’ data. This will create a breathing space for new entrants to emerge.”

Eich says GDPR-like standards have been adopted in several countries around the world including China, Brazil, Japan, India, South Korea and Argentina. Together, these countries make up roughly 51 percent of the world’s overall GDP and have experienced higher levels of efficiency and innovation in their business markets.

Eich believes that should the U.S. move in a similar direction, the country can keep its competitive edge and affirm its reputation as a leading global tech hub.

Furthermore, he suggests that GDPR-like protocols will establish greater trust within the United States between businesses and customers, as it is not necessary to track people’s movements online: the main reason for doing so is simply to generate ad-based revenue from the sites customers visit. Since late 2017, approximately 615 million devices built to block ads and tracking have been activated, suggesting a growing level of unease and distrust amongst everyday consumers.

“A GDPR-like standard in the United States will establish the foundation of trust to enable innovation and growth,” he writes. “This certainly applies in our own online media and advertising industry. Contrary to some of our industry colleagues, I believe that it is not tenable for any platform, publisher, technology vendor or trade body to claim that they must track people to generate revenue from advertising … Trust will only return as the GDPR-like laws begin to curtail the online advertising industry’s worst practices.”

Tracking movements to garner ad revenue occurs through a process known as online behavioral advertising (OBA). Data is collected from all the sites a consumer visits. Ads are then selected for display to the consumer based on his or her past maneuvers. Eich says OBA occurs via several third-party networks operating quietly through “opaque processes” with no central authority to be held accountable. In other words, this is a form of “behavioral tracking,” and he questions how ethical and safe it really is.

Recently, Eich filed privacy complaints in both Britain and Ireland against internet giant Google for playing “fast and loose” with customers’ private data. In his initial complaint, Eich said that Google offers intimate data about its consumers to several hundred companies without their knowledge to auction and place ads. He claims this goes against GDPR requirements that personal data be processed in a way that all consumers remain secure.

In addition, Facebook was at the height of scandal earlier this year when it was revealed that data firm Cambridge Analytica had gathered private information on millions of social media users without their knowledge and used it for political purposes. Cases like these are suggestive that tech companies have garnered too much power, and user data is usually under threat of being compromised.

Interestingly, GDPR also offers a “right to erasure” clause, in which a subject’s collected data is immediately erased from a company’s records granted the information was gathered unlawfully, is no longer needed, or the subject in question withdraws consent for the data to be used. This could present issues for blockchain-based companies, as all information on the blockchain is recorded in real-time to ensure irrefutable evidence of transactions and other relevant data.

At the same time, one of the primary requests among investors who engage in crypto-transactions via the blockchain is improved privacy and anonymity. Heightened usage of privacycoins like Monero and Zcash are proof of this, which means statutes similar to those of GDPR could be in line with the ideologies of privacy-focused blockchains.

GDPR is based on standards the United States initially endorsed back in 1980 through legislation known as the OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data. This legislation included a definition of the term “personal data” similar with that offered by GDPR. Also, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been fighting for GDPR-like features for over 10 years.

Brave as a company stands to gain little, if anything, directly from GDPR-like legislation being implemented in the United States. While the Brave browser protects user privacy and restricts advertisements, GDPR-like legislature would simply push forward what Eich and his company already believe: users deserve privacy over their online data. Eich’s letter reiterates that societies around the world are shifting toward a paradigm with a level playing field on the internet and that the United States should follow suit.",REGULATION,0.5267
2018/10/11,SEC Obtains Emergency Court Order to Halt Questionable ICO,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has obtained an emergency court order issuing the stoppage of a recently planned initial coin offering (ICO) by Blockvest LLC and its founder Reginald Buddy Ringgold III, who falsely advertised that the token sale was approved by the SEC.

According to the SEC, Blockvest has repeatedly violated both anti-fraud and securities registration provisions by incorrectly claiming that its ICO had obtained regulatory approval from Commission officials. The order further states that Ringgold — who also works under the name Rasool Abdul Rahim El — was using the SEC seal without the organization’s permission.

In addition, the SEC says that Ringgold often touted the ICO as being “licensed and regulated,” and that he promoted the event through a false agency known as the “Blockchain Exchange Commission,” which used graphics similar to the SEC seal and boasted the same address as the SEC’s headquarters.

Robert A. Cohen, chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Cyber Unit, comments, “We allege that this ICO is using both the SEC seal and a made-up crypto regulatory authority to trick investors into believing the ICO was approved by regulators. The SEC does not endorse investment products, and investors should be highly skeptical of any claims suggesting otherwise.”

Furthermore, Ringgold is being accused of misrepresenting Blockvest’s alleged ties to the National Futures Association (NFA) and continuing to use the group’s seal on assorted documents and marketing materials, even after representatives had sent him a cease-and-desist letter requesting that he discontinue his statements regarding Blockvest’s connections with the NFA.

The order is seeking the return of any gains obtained through false or misleading tactics, along with both interest and penalties. The SEC is also working to bar Ringgold from participating in any securities offerings, including digital securities, in the future. The organization has frozen all of Ringgold’s assets, while a hearing is scheduled for October 18, 2018, to examine whether the freeze should continue and if a preliminary injunction should be issued.

The incident serves as further proof that the SEC is playing hardball in the digital asset space. Recently, the SEC — along with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) — took firm action against 1pool Ltd., a brokerage firm based in the Marshall Islands, and its CEO Patrick Brunner. The SEC alleged that the venture was trading security swaps with customers across the globe while failing to meet the “discretionary investment threshold” required by federal securities law. The SEC is now seeking penalties and “permanent injunctions” against the company.

Previously, the SEC set a new precedent by charging smart contracts payments system TokenLot LLC with operating as an unregistered broker-dealer in what was the first case of its kind, following the release of the SEC’s DAO Report back in July of 2017. TokenLot was later made to pay nearly $500,000 in disgorgement, along with nearly $8,000 in interest fees.

The SEC also charged Crypto Asset Management LP (CAM) with operating as an unregistered investment firm and inappropriately calling itself the “first regulated crypto asset fund in the U.S.”",REGULATION,-0.5859
2018/10/12,Roubini Faces Off With Coin Center’s Van Valkenburgh at Senate Hearing,"Nouriel Roubini, an economist best known for his predictions of the 2008 housing bubble, and Peter Van Valkenburgh, Coin Center’s director of research, testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Community Affairs in a hearing on cryptocurrency and blockchain on October 11, 2018.

“We need to sort through the static,” said Banking Committee Chair Idaho Republican Mike Crapo, describing a need to better understand both the opportunities and the challenges in cryptoland. The testimony comes at a time when bitcoin has lost two-thirds of its value since the beginning of the year and U.S. regulators are trying to figure out how to regulate thousands of ICOs that have flown in the face of decades old securities laws.

Roubini wasted no time in firing off his salvos. He called crypto the “mother and father of all scams and [now busted] bubbles.” Among his list of other criticisms: blockchain is overhyped; Bitcoin cannot scale and it is not decentralized; only criminals and terrorists use bitcoin; crypto is a libertarian’s dream; and utility tokens will return us to the Stone Age. “Even the Flintstones knew better than crypto — they used clamshells as their own one currency,” he said, in one bewilderingly anachronistic statement.

In stark contrast, Van Valkenburgh hailed bitcoin as “revolutionary” for its ability to function as a payment system without a trusted middleman. He referred to bitcoin’s underlying technology as a “computer science breakthrough” on par with the internet. Pointing to breaches at Equifax, Swift and DYN in the last two years, he called blockchain technology “our best hope” for secure systems.    

The two testimonies were followed by questions from senators. When asked what factors hindered a broader adoption of blockchain technology, Van Valkenburgh said actual use cases were “hard challenges” and compared blockchain technology to email in the 1970s.

“It took 20 years for those systems to be friendly enough for consumers to want to use them to send messages,” he said.

Roubini, with his usual gloominess, said no government or bank would want to use a public blockchain, because it was too risky. “The idea of decentralization is never going to fly,” he said.  

When asked for examples of how the world was better off with blockchain technology, Van Valkenburgh cited one example: In Afghanistan, a country where men control finances, a woman named Roya Mahboob was able to use bitcoin to pay her female employees.

“I don't think the world is better off,” Roubini grimaced. He pointed to M-Pesa, a mobile money transfer service that is widely used in Kenya, as an example of a system that has transformed fintech. M-Pesa is centralized and does not use a blockchain. Van Valkenburgh called M-Pesa and WeChat, an app used for mobile payments in China, “tools for totalitarianism” because they allow governments access to user data.

The topic of crime came up several times in the hearing. Van Valkenburgh agreed with one senator’s comments that criminals are often early adopters of a new tech.

“In fact, I think if criminals aren’t using your technology, your technology is not worth anything,” Van Valkenburgh said. Bitcoin was notably used in the Silk Road, a now defunct online dark market. He also made it clear bitcoin transactions are traceable, which is how many Silk Road drug traffickers were caught and brought to justice.

When asked if bitcoin would ever move beyond five transactions per second, Roubini replied proof of work is not, and never will be, scalable.

“We can do a lot more,” Van Valkenburgh said, pointing to the Lighting Network, a layer two payment solution for bitcoin. Coin Center even has an M&M machine that is rigged to the Lightning Network, he said. It allows anyone in the Coin Center office to buy a single M&M with a tiny fraction of bitcoin.

Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren asked if decentralization was an inherent property of blockchain technology. Sticking to his script, Roubini replied that it was: Due to economies of scale, single entities control a majority of the bitcoin mining. He added that the situation would only become worse with proof of stake, because oligarchs would control the majority of coins in a system.  

Senator Warren expressed concern that cryptocurrencies were an easy target for theft and a lot of small investors are being scammed through initial coin offerings. “New technologies create these new opportunities,” she said. “But if we are not careful they can follow the same old patterns — they make the rich richer and leave everyone else behind.”",REGULATION,0.9816
2018/10/18,SEC Sets Up Open Line of Communication for Fintech Projects With FinHub,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has launched a new office to engage with cryptocurrency and blockchain startups. Called the Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology (FinHub), the division will make it easier for fintech startups to interact with the regulator on related issues and the legal implications of products before they launch them.

Announced Thursday, October 18, 2018, FinHub will serve as the central point for entrepreneurs in the fintech world, especially groups focusing on new technologies such as blockchains, artificial intelligence, digital marketplace financing and more.

With the number of subpoenas being sent out by the agency and the expansion of its clampdown on blockchain startups that it claims have violated federal securities law, the FinHub can direct entrepreneurs and provide the much-needed clarity on the requirements needed to build compliant platforms and products.

Entrepreneurs and developers will be able to ask questions from the Hub as well as have access to the regulator's views and actions about the fintech space. Startups can also use the portal to request for meetings with the regulator.

The Hub will be led by Valerie A. Szczepanik, the Senior Advisor for Digital Asset and Innovation in the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance, and will be staffed with agency officials with expertise in fintech related issues.

Szczepanik said the SEC has been educating entrepreneurs for a while now but the portal will centralize the process.

“SEC staff across the agency have been engaged for some time in efforts to understand emerging technologies, communicate the agency's stance on new issues, and facilitate beneficial innovations in the securities industry.”

SEC Chairman Jay Clayton believes the portal will provide a ""central point of focus"" for the agency's ""efforts to monitor and engage on innovations in the securities market.""

""The SEC is committed to working with investors and market participants on new approaches to capital formation, market structure, and financial services, with an eye toward enhancing, and in no way reducing, investor protection.""

The number of cases being pursued by the SEC and its sister agencies has increased over the years. Just last month, the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed charges against securities broker 1pool Ltd for offering security-based swaps funded with Bitcoin, which the agency says violates federal securities law.

The regulator also went after the owners of PlexCoin and issued a cease and desist order to Hedge Fund Crypto Asset Management and its founder Timothy Enneking for misrepresenting the company as the ""first regulated crypto asset fund in the United States."" ",REGULATION,0.9902
2018/10/20,Marco Santori on Airdrops and the “Complete Picture” of SAFT Regulation,"Ever since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a stern warning about initial coin offerings (ICOs) in February 2018, cryptocurrency projects have had to consider different options for distributing their tokens — and funding their development.

One alternative for dispersing a token is an airdrop, where tokens are given out (for free) to the holders of an existing cryptocurrency. A former partner at law firm Cooley LLP has a positive view on them. “Airdrops can do no harm. In fact, we think they can make things better,” Marco Santori, who is now the president and chief legal officer at Blockchain, a bitcoin wallet provider, told Bitcoin Magazine.   

“An airdrop doesn’t get around the securities laws; but, that said, unless the thing that you’re airdropping, the token that you’re airdropping, is a security, then the airdrop is not a securities offering,” he continued. “I think they can be a powerful tool for decentralization.”

In a recent interview, Santori shared more of his thoughts on raising funds and the future of regulation.

He thinks an issuance framework he worked on while at Cooley called SAFT, short for Simple Agreement Future Tokens, is a useful alternative to traditional ICOs. In the arrangement, accredited investors lend money to a project with the promise that tokens will become available after the network is up and running. The SAFT white paper was published in October 2017; since then, SAFT has become a market standard.

“I think that the SAFT framework is probably the best that we have today,” Santori said. “If you layer on top of that the additional clarity that the SEC has provided in the context of Bill Hinman’s speech or the so-called ‘Hinman test’ that incorporated the SAFT framework, then you’ve got a pretty complete picture.”

Santori is referring to statements made by the SEC’s director of the division of corporation finance in June 2018. At that time, Hinman addressed the possibility that a token could begin life as a security and then convert to something other than a security when a network became sufficiently decentralized, like Bitcoin.

As far as the SEC goes, Santori doesn’t think the regulator will be handing out any further guidance for ICO projects. “We have probably gotten all of the informal guidance we’re going to get,” he said. However, he does anticipate some “no-action” relief to start coming down the pike soon.

If a project is uncertain whether a particular activity constitutes a violation of federal securities laws, they can request a no-action letter from the SEC. If they receive a relief, no civil or criminal action will be taken against them for engaging in that activity.  

“I expect that we’ll be seeing SEC’s response to some of those requests coming out. And those responses have some precedential value — not legal precedent, but practical precedent — and we’ll be seeing some more of that,” he said.

Existing laws likely will be good enough for the regulators, Santori thinks. “The Treasury Department and FinCEN [Financial Crimes Enforcement Network], in particular, have stuck to their guns. They have said that the laws we have are enough; the rules we have are enough.”   

At the end of the day, Santori feels it will be up to courts to make the ultimate decision on whether a token is a security. “A number of lawsuits are winding their way through the federal courts today and likely private lawsuits will answer the question first,” he said.  

Of course, the SEC has to follow the law like everyone else. “The SEC is just the plaintiff, and if SEC takes one position and a defendant decides to take a different position and fight, then ultimately it’s going to be the courts that decide in a civil case whether this token sale is a security or not,” said Santori. “The SEC is a very powerful plaintiff.”

Santori will weigh in on airdrops and the future of regulating cryptocurrencies along with Brent McIntosh, General Counsel for the U.S. Department of the Treasury, at Money 20/20 in Las Vegas, October 21–24, 2018. The U.S. Department of the Treasury administers FinCEN, the regulator that punishes money launderers.

2018/10/22,Report: Cryptocurrencies Should Be Governed by Current EU Financial Laws,"The Securities and Markets Stakeholder Group (SMSG) has released a new report suggesting that the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) recommend to the European Commission that it regulate the cryptocurrency space with existing legislation rather than instilling new rules and laws.

The report specifies that most crypto assets are covered by the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, which regulates unfair business practices in the European Union and requires corresponding laws to be passed that incorporate it into each member state’s legal system. However, cryptocurrencies are covered only in the sense that an entity issuing a crypto asset is labeled as a business, while the person purchasing it is a consumer.

The report asks several questions about different classes (payment tokens, utility tokens and asset tokens) of digital monies to determine whether they can or should fall under present statutes. For example, does the asset in question give the owner an entitlement against the issuer? Is it transferable? Is it scarce, and how is the scarcity controlled?

In terms of payment tokens like bitcoin, the report mentions that they are not presently covered by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II), which is the EU legislation that regulates firms providing services to clients linked to financial instruments like stock shares and bonds. These tokens are also not covered under the Prospectus Regulation, which governs businesses’ shareholding structures, or the Market Abuse Regulation. The report suggests that these assets bear many of the same risks as other investment objects, and thus the authors urge the EU to place these cryptocurrencies under MiFID II control.

The second class of financial assets — utility tokens — are a completely different ballgame. These currencies are not classified as investments, as they represent a doorway for investors to access a company’s products and services. Many times, utility tokens are issued through initial coin offerings (ICOs). To raise capital, a new company or startup will sell a utility token to investors, who in turn gain access to a whole new coin.

Utility tokens aren’t covered under EU financial regulations as they are not transferable and are only usable in a relationship between the user and the issuer. Thus, the report says these currencies should not be covered by MiFID II unless they are considered transferable. An example would be Filecoin, which builds and runs distributed data applications and helps build smart contracts. Thus, Filecoin has the potential to become an investment object in the future, and in this case, it would carry many of the same risks as traditional stocks.

Lastly, the report examines asset tokens, which represent physical goods and can be used to finance new business projects. They can also be used to represent the titles and transfers of goods, which are then recorded into the blockchain and enlist stronger security measures for both the receiving and offering parties.

To better understand how these tokens should be regulated, the report examines which assets are financial instruments or transferable securities. If a token offers a user financial entitlement of some kind, it bears the same features as both bonds and shares. It is thus transferable and — per the report’s suggestion — should fall under MiFID II and the Prospectus Regulation. Examples include EOS and any other ERC20-based tokens, as they can be purchased and traded via digital exchanges and are transferable between rewards programs, compatible wallets and participating merchants.

However, if the asset gives right to an entitlement but is not transferable or doesn’t give the holder any kind of decision power, it shares features with prepaid assets and therefore does not warrant financial regulation now or in the future. Examples include badges or statements about public keys.

It should be made clear that ESMA does not have the power to implement new laws and regulations regarding financial instruments like cryptocurrencies, nor can it change existing laws. Thus, the report is meant to advise ESMA on how to discuss such changes with the European Commission.",REGULATION,0.9889
2018/10/24,Japanese Financial Services Authority Approves Self-Regulation for Crypto,"Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) has granted self-regulatory status to the country's cryptocurrency industry, giving the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) authority to oversee the space, according to a Reuters report.

The FSA approval, which was granted on Wednesday, October 24, 2018, gives the association the power to regulate the sector, safeguard customer assets, give operational guidelines, elaborate on anti-money laundering policies and provide necessary compliance guidelines for crypto exchanges in the country.

Reuters quoted an unnamed FSA official who believes the industry would grow faster if it were regulated by the companies that operate in the industry.

“It’s a very fast-moving industry. It’s better for experts to make rules in a [more] timely manner than bureaucrats do.”

The new self-regulation policy is effective immediately. Prior to the regulator’s approval, the JVCEA had drawn up a set of self-regulatory rules proposing, among other measures, a ban on the trading of privacy-centric coins, such as Monero, on crypto exchanges. Members are also considering holding deposits and government bonds to insure digital assets.

Established in April 2018, the JVCEA is an association of 16 licensed cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan, launched as a concerted effort among the exchanges to safeguard investors’ assets and regain local confidence in the industry in the aftermath of the $530 million Coincheck hack and the Zaif hack.

The association submitted a formal application to the FSA in August 2018, asking for recognition and the power to self-regulate itself.

Similar to the JVCEA, the Virtual Commodity Association (VCA) was launched by Gemini founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss as a self-regulatory organization that would police the U.S. virtual currency industry. The association also announced the appointment of former New York State Department of Financial Services executive Maria Filipakis as interim executive director for the association.",REGULATION,0.4588
2018/10/26,IRS Advisory Committee Requests Clearer Guidance for Crypto Tax Code,"On October 24, 2018, an advisory committee to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) published a report calling for clarity on the IRS’s position toward cryptocurrency taxation.

The Information Reporting Program Advisory Committee (IRPAC) recently released its annual report advising the IRS on possible areas to improve the tax code, specifically referring to data gathered throughout the fiscal year of 2018.

In this 95-page report, multiple sections are dedicated to the issue of cryptocurrency taxation, with the IRPAC specifically recommending “that the IRS issue further guidance on the information reporting and withholding implications of cryptocurrency transactions.”

Cryptocurrency tax policy has been a headache for investors, as the IRS regards each trade as a taxable event akin to realizing gains on an investment. Perhaps due to the abstruse nature of the tax code and the inherent complexities that come with reporting each trade, few investors reported their gains for the 2017 tax year.

In the report’s overhead, the IRPAC specifically credits the IRS’s Notice 2014-21 for acknowledging that virtual currency is still treated as property in the eyes of the federal government’s capacity to levy taxes.

Nevertheless, the report claims that the rise of cryptocurrency has raised further questions about the tax regulations around the nascent asset class, including whether or not cryptocurrency is a specified foreign financial asset or if crypto transactions must follow the guidelines of broker reporting.

The report cites research from Fundstrat Global Advisors in April, which estimates that there are $25 billion in tax liabilities within the United States. The report goes on to state that “because transactions in virtual currencies can be difficult to trace and have an inherently pseudonymous aspect, some taxpayers may be tempted to hide taxable income from the IRS.”

Needless to say, such a large potential source of taxable income would be of great interest to the IRS, and the report goes on to detail several “general tax principles” that apply to property transactions, stating that these would logically apply to crypto asset transactions as well.

The report concludes the cryptocurrency section by referencing the court’s attempts to enforce a summons on Coinbase, and how this could form a useful precedent for dealing with crypto asset holders that wish to avoid federal tax agents, stating that “IRPAC would be very interested in helping develop information reporting and withholding guidance on these important issues.”

2018/10/31,Indian Officials Consider Ban on “Private Cryptocurrencies”,"Agents of the Indian government have met to formally discuss a possible ban on private cryptocurrency holdings in the nation.

On October 30, 2018, the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) issued a press release detailing their recent meeting where they “reviewed the current global and domestic economic situation and financial sector performance.”

The council seemed deeply concerned about “the need for identifying and securing critical information infrastructure,” under the guise of “strengthening security in the financial sector.”

To this end, the report mentioned a deliberation “on the issues and challenges of crypto assets/currency, and was briefed about the deliberations of the High-Level Committee … to devise an appropriate legal framework to ban use of private cryptocurrencies in India and encourage the use of distributed ledger technology.”

It should be noted that the council appears to refer to “private cryptocurrencies” as coins that operate on an open-source, permissionless blockchain, and this classification should not be confused with privacycoins, a subset of cryptocurrencies that focus on anonymous transactions.

This stance on the different applications of blockchain technology seems to be an unfortunately common one across different major economies worldwide. Earlier this year, China began to make public its support for the applications of distributed ledger technology, while continuing to remain either silent or generally negative on the prospects of a truly decentralized currency.

The Indian government has recently shown several indicators of a growing hardline stance on cryptocurrency, with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) banning crypto exchanges in July 2018, and the proprietor of a Bitcoin ATM in Bangalore being arrested in late October.

Other than these general trends in Indian policy, however, crypto speculators abroad have little to go on. The FSDC’s report did not elaborate on their intended meaning of “use,” or whether this means a proposed ban on trading, holding, mining or any other possible interactions with cryptocurrency networks.

It is unclear the extent to which the Indian government will clarify its overall intentions toward cryptocurrency in the days to come.",REGULATION,-0.7217
2018/11/1,Hong Kong Securities Regulator Promises to Regulate Crypto Investment Funds,"The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong has claimed that it will include crypto funds under its regulatory umbrella.

The SFC issued a statement on November 1, 2018, laying out its new approach for regulating virtual assets in the future. The SFC granted that there are many inherent risks in investing in a new space like cryptoassets and set out to address these risks through new regulatory action.

The statement showed a willingness to adapt the existing regulations around investing to conveniently and decisively affect crypto as well, staying away from either making these sorts of assets a specific new class of assets or attempting to discourage virtual assets altogether.

Unlike mainland China, which has displayed a certain aversion toward private cryptocurrencies, the autonomous region of Hong Kong is apparently taking a different approach. This has led many crypto companies to move out of mainland China, choosing instead to ramp up operations within the region of Hong Kong alone.

This stance of adapting the laws to include virtual assets and asset funds reflects an attitude that the economic model of investments and transactions is still fundamentally the same, with the main dangers coming from the uncertain atmosphere of new crypto markets.

In addition to releasing the statement on their general intentions, the SFC also released a circular for intermediaries on the same day. In this circular, the SFC claimed that it has “observed investors’ growing interest in funds which invest in ‘virtual assets’” and, to this end, that it wishes to provide some helpful guidance toward intermediaries.

The circular included information about how intermediaries can deal with cryptoassets and still remain compliant with existing regulations, including a series of pointers for fund managers and daily operations, information that customers are privy to and more.

From these recent releases, it appears the SFC is using its status as Hong Kong’s main financial regulator to create a crypto-friendly environment in as painless a manner as possible, and that Hong Kong will act favorably to these sorts of assets in the immediate future.",REGULATION,0.5859
2018/11/1,Op Ed: 10 Takeaways From Recent French Guidance on Blockchain and the GDPR,"“The GDPR, and more generally the classical principles of personal data protection, were conceived in a world where the management of data was centralized within specific entities. In this regard, the decentralized model of data governance embodied by blockchain and the multiplicity of actors involved in the processing of data complicate the definition of the roles of each one.” Blockchain: Premiers éléments d’analyse de la CNIL (unofficial translation).
In late September 2018, France became the first EU member state to release official guidance on the complicated interplay between the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and blockchain technology. The Commission nationale de l’informatique et des libertés (CNIL) guidance is complex and nuanced but suggests some important takeaways about blockchain GDPR compliance.

Takeaway No. 1: Users of blockchain solutions may be considered to be controllers of their own data.
The CNIL guidance identifies a category of actors termed “participants” (i.e., initiators of transactions on a blockchain) who have rights to write data to the chain and who decide to submit that data for validation by other participants (i.e., miners and “validator nodes”). Because these participants are deciding the purposes for which personal data will be processed and have chosen blockchain technology as the means for processing, the CNIL remarks that they should be considered controllers.

This part of the CNIL guidance will have a significant positive impact on various blockchain solutions — especially self-sovereign identity solutions — that seek to take control over personal data away from business entities and put it back into the hands of individuals.

Takeaway No. 2: Cryptocurrency exchanges are controllers of personal data under the GDPR.
According to the CNIL guidance, a controller will be either (a) a natural person who is processing personal data in a professional or commercial context or (b) a legal person who is writing personal data to the chain.

In a specific example, the CNIL states that “a physical person who engages in the purchase or sale of bitcoin … can be considered a controller if he conducts these transactions in the course of a professional or commercial activity, for the accounts of other physical persons.”

This statement appears to put cryptocurrency exchanges squarely within the definition of a data controller under the GDPR and likely subjects them to all obligations applicable to controllers.

Takeaway No. 3: Miners or validator nodes of blockchain transactions are processors of personal data under the GDPR.
The CNIL guidance notes that any actor merely validating transactions or writing data to the chain at another’s direction should be considered a processor. Therefore, persons or entities operating as miners or validator nodes on a blockchain will likely be considered processors of personal data.

Takeaway No. 4: Blockchain is not incompatible with the GDPR’s right of erasure.
Despite previous conjecture that a blockchain’s immutability would put it forever at odds with the right of erasure, initial guidance proposes a welcome middle ground.

The CNIL suggests that erasure of personal data stored on a blockchain might be accomplished by rendering the data “almost inaccessible, and therefore approximat[ing] the effects of erasure of the data.” Further, destroying the underlying private key or value generating the encrypted or hashed result would be “sufficient to anonymize the cryptographic commitment in such a way that it loses its quality of personal data.” Of course, in order for these techniques to be effective, personal data residing off the blockchain must be deleted as well.

Takeaway No. 5: Participants on a permissioned blockchain must designate a single data controller or risk having all participants deemed joint controllers.
Among those who might be classified as controllers on a permissioned blockchain — those entities determining the purposes for the processing and writing to the chain — the CNIL offers two options: The controllers or group of participants may either create a legal entity in the form of an association or “GIE” (Economic Interest Group), or they may choose one participant to make data protection decisions for the group and designate that entity as the controller.

If the group chooses to do neither, then each participant will be considered jointly responsible as a controller under the GDPR and must separately adhere to all applicable obligations. (The application of this concept to a public permissionless blockchain remains unclear and will likely be a subject of future guidance.)

Takeaway No. 6: Developers of smart contracts will be considered data processors when they develop smart contracts at the direction of a third party.
With regard to smart contracts, the CNIL guidance keeps open the possibility for the designers of smart contracts to be either processors or controllers, depending on the circumstances. However, the guidance provides some clarity by citing an example that directly invokes a real-life smart contracts pilot called “fizzy,” which was launched last year by global insurance company AXA.

In the example, “a software developer offers an insurance company a solution in the form of a smart contract, which allows the company to automate the compensation of passengers when their flight is delayed. This developer will be viewed as a processor by virtue of the insurance company, the controller.” The entity directing the creation and use of the smart contract will likely be deemed a controller.

Takeaway No. 7: Any business looking to use blockchain technology should carefully assess privacy considerations before going live with its solution.
Any organization building or using blockchain solutions must keep privacy compliance at the forefront — both in meeting the requirements of the GDPR and in minimizing potential for harm to individuals. Organizations should begin by considering whether a blockchain solution is truly necessary or whether the same result can be achieved by more traditional, centralized means. The CNIL wisely points out, “Blockchain is not always the best technology for all processing of data; it may be the source of difficulties for the controller with respect to its GDPR obligations.”

If blockchain technology is still preferred, the CNIL strongly encourages entities to perform a privacy-by-design analysis in advance of any processing. The regulator repeatedly recommends that developers, businesses and other actors undertake a detailed assessment of the need for recourse to blockchain technology, the privacy “pros and cons” thereof, and the way that personal data will be handled on the blockchain platform.

It is also crucial that the controller determine the need for, and if necessary conduct, a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) for each processing operation envisioned on the blockchain. The DPIA will allow the controller to later demonstrate that it has weighed and documented the risks and protections in advance of processing.

Takeaway No. 8: Permissioned blockchains should have a minimum number of nodes to protect the integrity of blockchain data.
The CNIL’s security guidance advises blockchain operators to account for the possibility of “51 percent attacks,” where actors controlling more than half the network’s computing power would be able to modify or prevent further transactions or entries on the chain. To prevent such an event, the CNIL recommends that evaluations be performed to determine the minimum number of miners needed to mitigate this risk.

Still, while it is advisable to ensure that a blockchain is adequately distributed among at least a minimum number of independent nodes, far more complex controls will be required to guard against risks related to collusion and consolidated control over those nodes.

Takeaway No. 9: Data subjects must have recourse to challenge the outcome of smart contracts — although the form this recourse should take is unclear.
The CNIL’s guidance is seemingly inconsistent on the extent to which a data subject should be able to contest the output of smart contracts.

In one sentence, the guidance appears to require that data subjects be able to intervene in smart contracts, stating that a “data subject should be able to obtain human intervention, to express his point of view and contest the decision, after which the contract may be executed.”

In the very next sentence, the guidance appears to state that it is sufficient to allow a data subject to challenge a smart contract after execution, stating that it is “appropriate that the controller provides for possibility of human intervention that allows … the data subject to challenge the decision, even if the contract was already executed.”

Perhaps the only thing that is clear is that in scenarios where smart contracts process personal data, the data subject should have some level of recourse to challenge the outcome of the smart contract transaction.

Takeaway No. 10: There will be “right” and “wrong” ways to use blockchains from a privacy and security perspective, and more guidance is forthcoming.
On October 3, 2018, the European Parliament passed a resolution titled “Distributed ledger technologies and blockchains: building trust with disintermediation.” The resolution, which acknowledges distributed ledger technology as “a tool that promotes the empowerment of citizens by giving them the opportunity to control their own data,” makes recommendations to member states encouraging adoption and best practices of blockchain platforms.

Both the EU resolution and the release of the CNIL’s guidance send a strong signal that the EU will not, as some have feared, decree blockchain technology to be fundamentally incompatible with the GDPR. To the contrary, these official actions indicate an acute awareness of the advantages of blockchain technology and a willingness to work with industry to increase adoption, so long as participants understand that there may ultimately emerge right and wrong ways to “do blockchain” from a privacy perspective.",REGULATION,0.9992
2018/11/1,Coinsource Receives BitLicense to Operate Bitcoin ATMs in New York,"Bitcoin ATM Operator Coinsource has been granted a BitLicense by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).

Based in Texas, Coinsource deploys Bitcoin ATMs to key population centers across the world with over 200 machines installed in the U.S. alone.

CEO of Coinsource Sheffield Clark called the announcement a “landmark day for Coinsource"" and an ""important win for New Yorkers"" in a statement.

In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Clark noted that he sees the ""license as validation of not only our tireless efforts to offer Americans easy, convenient access to an evolving global financial system, but also progress in the acceptance and legitimization of bitcoin as a valuable currency.""

The virtual currency license from the NYDFS will allow Coinsource to conduct business with customers and companies based in the state. Additionally, New York-based businesses will also be able to use Coinsource's ATM kiosks to buy and sell bitcoins instantly.

Formulated in 2015, BitLicense approvals have been among the most difficult credentials to procure for virtual currency businesses seeking to operate in New York. The set of rules was developed by the New York Department of Financial Services to govern digital currency businesses operating in the state.

CoinSource becomes the first Bitcoin ATM operator and the 12th company overall to receive a BitLicense from the New York regulator, joining other crypto-related businesses such as Genesis, Square, Coinbase, bitFlyer, Circle and others.

Before receiving its BitLicense, Coinsource had operated under a special DFS provisional license in the state.

According to Clark, the license took over three years to obtain; Coinsource had applied for it back in August 2015. Having now received it, Clark says the company feels excited to have been granted such a ""prestigious license.""

""We are extremely honored to receive this recognition from the state of New York and applaud the state for its dedication to ensuring cryptocurrency companies are regulated appropriately.""

He also spoke about the growth in the demand for Bitcoin ATMs in the country, which he noted surpassed the expectations of the firm. Notwithstanding, the ATM operator's immediate focus is to grow domestically as it expands its presence to all the 50 states in America.

""Aligning with blockchain’s decentralized nature, Coinsource focuses on allowing any person, no matter what their socio-economic status is, technological know-how, or where they are based, access to our generation’s most important innovation,"" he concluded.",REGULATION,0.9892
2018/11/2,SEC’s End-of-Fiscal-Year Report Reveals Heavy Action Against ICO-Related Fraud,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has released a report detailing actions taken against fraudulent ICOs and financial ventures, and, indeed, the year has been wrought with cases. The report details actions for 2018’s fiscal year, which ended on September 30, and offers insight into the ICO-related fraud that has seemingly come to light over the past several months.

Misconduct actions against ICOs and similar cryptocurrency ventures are led by the organization’s Cyber Unit, which became fully operational this year. The SEC explains in the report, “We believe our approach to enforcement in this space has been thoughtful and consistent. Importantly, it has provided a template for authorities in other countries, where fraud and misconduct targeting U.S. investors often have been based.”

The report regards ICOs as “high-risk investments,” as many “lack viable products or established track records.” The document also says that many contain shady business models or are unable to safeguard digital assets from theft by hackers, while others are completely fraudulent and operate under the guise of garnering business capital.

Since the formation of the Cyber Unit, the SEC’s actions against cyber-related misconduct has increased heavily. In 2018, the organization brought forth 20 standalone cases related to financial fraud, 12 of which had to do with ICOs and digital assets. At the end of the fiscal year, the SEC states that it had roughly 225 cyber-related investigations occurring at once.

One of biggest cases against an ICO involved two individuals who had opened a venture known as TokenLot LLC, which they described as an “ICO superstore.” The SEC filed charges against both figures for operating as an unregistered broker-dealer and for participating in unregistered offerings, though the charges were later settled in mid-September.

The SEC also obtained an emergency order halting an ICO led by Titanium Blockchain Infrastructure Services, Inc. and its president Michael Alan Stollery, a self-described “blockchain evangelist.” That ICO raised roughly $21 million from thousands of investors, both in and out of the U.S., but the SEC became involved after it received complaints that Stollery had lied about Titanium’s business relationships with the Federal Reserve and several other established businesses including Verizon, PayPal and the Walt Disney Company. Additional complaints also claimed that Titanium’s website contained false testimonials from corporate customers.

Other instances involved the cyber intrusion of a broker-dealer and investment advisor in Iowa. The intrusion compromised the personal information of several thousand customers. The SEC charged the firm with violating the Identity Theft Red Flags Rule — also known as Regulation S-ID — which works to help protect investors against the risks of identity theft. The SEC also charged another defendant who had allegedly been manipulating prices of Fitbit securities through false regulatory filings.

The SEC acknowledges that ICOs have become a popular method of raising capital for startups and new businesses. While representatives do not wish to stifle innovation in the financial space, they have worked hard over the past several months to educate investors regarding which fundraising efforts may or may not be legitimate. Methods of informing investors include releasing public statements and enforcing trading suspensions. The SEC has also recommended enforcement actions against companies that seek to violate registration protocols or engage in unlicensed broker-dealer activity.

In addition, the SEC has implemented harder methods of fighting fraud such as the Share Class Selection Disclosure (SCSD) Initiative, which is designed to swiftly identify and remedy widespread financial violations. The SEC is now planning to enforce SCSD standards to ensure the return of substantial funds to retail investors that have been cheated by fraudulent ICOs.",REGULATION,-0.9838
2018/11/5,China's Central Bank Wants to Put the Damper on Airdrops: Report,"The People's Bank of China (PBoC), China's central bank, has its eyes on cryptocurrency companies that run airdrop campaigns in the country.

In its most recent financial stability report for 2018, which was published on Friday, November 3, 2018, the bank said there has been a surge in the number of ""disguised"" Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), including the free distribution of crypto tokens through airdrops, despite its effort to clamp down on their activities.

Based on the report, the bank states that the companies running token giveaways are evading China’s blanket ban on ICOs by issuing free tokens to the investor, while keeping a large chunk of the total supply for speculation on a crypto exchange, where speculation would drive the prices up so they can profit.

Last year, the central bank banned ICOs, calling them ""illegal fundraising"" that were targeting innocent investors. According to the PBoC report, before the ban took effect, 65 ICOs had been completed up until July 18, 2017, while only five were launched before 2017. This sudden jump also attracted over 105,000 investors who contributed a total of about 2.6 billion yuan ($377.3 million), a figure, the PBoC states, accounted for 20 percent of the total ICO funding raised globally by blockchain startups.

The central bank also made its concerns known about crypto firms who had moved their operations overseas but were using local agents to invest on behalf of domestic investors in China. The vice governor of the PBoC had warned foreign ICOs targeting Chinese investors at a separate event, earlier this year. He had stated at the time:

""Any new financial product or phenomenon that is not authorized under the existing legal framework, we will crush them as soon as they dare to surface.""

Not one to rest on its laurels, the PBoC said it would continue to monitor the crypto industry, coordinating with other agencies to help safeguard and protect the interest of investors.

The bank's toughened stance with cryptocurrency began in 2013, where it published the “Notice on Precautions Against the Risks of Bitcoin,”where bitcoin was not deemed to be legal tender in China—to the most recent ban on ICOs in 2017.

Since then, there has been an onslaught of anti-crypto measures in the country. Earlier this year, commercial venues were banned from hosting crypto events, WeChat blocked some high profile blockchain related accounts, while Tencent, Baidu and Alibaba issued statements announcing restrictions put in place to limit crypto-related activities on their platforms.",REGULATION,-0.0691
2018/11/8,EtherDelta Founder Charged by SEC For Operating an Unregistered Exchange,"In an apparent first, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged the founder of EtherDelta, Zachary Coburn, with running an “unregistered national securities exchange,” according to a press release from the regulator.

“EtherDelta provided a marketplace for bringing together buyers and sellers for digital asset securities through the combined use of an order book, a website that displayed orders, and a ‘smart contract’ run on the Ethereum blockchain,” the agency noted.

EtherDelta's users have processed over 3.6 million orders for ERC20 tokens during an 18-month period, including those that are defined as securities under the federal securities law, the SEC explained. It went further to argue that a large majority of the orders placed on the platforms ""were traded after the Commission issued its 2017 DAO Report,"" which stipulated that certain assets like the DAO tokens were securities, placing any platform that offered trading of such ""digital asset securities"" under the ""SEC's requirement that exchanges register or operate pursuant to an exemption.""

EtherDelta, which operates a trustless exchange where it only provides a platform for users to trade, failed to register with the regulator or file for an exemption, the agency stated.

The release also noted that the SEC had taken enforcement actions against a handful of tokens that had once traded on the exchange.

Stephanie Avakian, co-director of the SEC's Enforcement Division, spoke on the charges against EtherDelta, arguing that it was mandatory for the platform to register with the SEC as it had ""both the user interface and underlying functionality of an online national securities exchange.""

Coburn, who has neither admitted or denied the findings of the agency, had cooperated with the agency by agreeing to pay over $300,000 in disgorgement, as well as $13,000 in prejudgment interest and an additional $75,000 fine.",REGULATION,-0.2023
2018/11/8,"In the Race for a Bitcoin ETF, Wall Street Has Plenty of Hurdles to Clear","In the latter half of 2018, few developments have occupied crypto investors’ headspaces like the industry’s indefatigable pursuit of a bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF).

This conversation lay largely dormant since the Winklevosses’ first attempt was rejected by the U.S. securities regulator in March of 2017. But the twins reignited the conversation when their second attempt at an ETF was shot down by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July of this year. 

With the buzz back, the prospect (or failing prospects) of a bitcoin ETF have crowded the headlines of mainstream and crypto media alike. Following the Winklevosses’ failure to secure the coveted first-in-the-industry fund, the ensuing months would see a flurry of decision delays for existing applications, more rejections and revisions of said rejections.

The sheer volume of news surrounding ETFs — and the general complexity of the asset when compared to the simplicity of trading on the bitcoin spot market — makes the industry’s pursuit of one a rich and even abstruse topic.

So let’s see if we can set the record straight.

What an ETF Is and What It Means for Bitcoin
To start, a short explanation: an ETF is a fund that holds an underlying asset or assets, be they stocks, commodities, bonds, etc., which are then divided into shares for investors to buy. In structure, an ETF functions like a hedge fund, the primary difference being that an ETF is traded on a public market like shares of a stock, while a hedge fund is not.

With that primer in mind, we can now unpack the processes and jargon that constitute an ETF’s many working parts.

Typically, an ETF features four primary stakeholders:

a sponsor (the entity who creates the ETF)
a custodian (the entity who stores and manages the underlying asset/s)
authorized participants (financial institutions or accredited individuals who create and redeem a block of the ETF’s shares)
shareholders/investors (those who purchase the shares on the open market)
More or less, authorized participants and sponsors are in charge of the ETF’s supply. The participants create or redeem blocks of shares (called creation units) directly from the sponsor; typically, these creation units are settled in-kind, meaning they are purchased for or redeemed in the underlying asset. Once participants have purchased creation units, these units are then divided into shares and traded on public exchanges.

For bitcoin, an ETF would function similarly to ETFs for other commodities like gold and silver. Its sponsor, most likely a trust of sorts, would employ the help of a custodian to store the physical bitcoins backing the ETFs (or, in the case of futures, the futures contracts) and related cash flow, and it would also rely on eager financial institutions to jumpstart circulation by purchasing shares to trade on a regulated, legacy exchange like the NYSE, CME or Cboe.

Many investors see the bitcoin ETF as the hitherto undiscovered holy grail of institutional-grade bitcoin investments, something that could push the market to new heights. In the broader market, ETFs are considered to be a low-barrier, low-cost alternative to other investment vehicles like hedge funds, and per this rationale, community members in favor of a bitcoin ETF say it would finally give institutional investors easy, reliable access to the crypto market. Supporting this thesis, proponents often point to the impacts ETFs had on the underlying gold market, noting that bitcoin would likely experience a similar price stimulation.

Detractors don’t think this is a good thing. They believe that, by encouraging a flood of institutional money, a bitcoin ETF would drown the market in inflated valuations, an argument critics in other markets have made by insisting that ETFs distort prices and liquidity. So the argument goes: Why would we create an investment vessel that could leave bitcoin susceptible to the same inflationary threats that it was created to avoid?

The Playing Field
The merits of either argument are for another article entirely, but the perspectives are helpful for understanding why so many players are pursuing an ETF and why there’s so much noise surrounding it.

The following list looks at all past and current applications, some of which were refiled or restructured after the initial applications were rejected by the SEC or pulled by their sponsors.

The Winklevoss Standard and the Rationale for Rejection
The Winklevosses were the first to try and first to fail at filing a bitcoin ETF. Naturally, they set a precedent for other contenders to follow, as subsequent filings were submitted with the frontrunner’s shortcomings in mind. For the SEC, the Winklevosses’ first attempt has become something of a touchstone to evaluate the worth of those that came after it, as the first rejection order is cited in every rejection order the SEC has issued since.

And that’s because the SEC keeps running into the same problems.

In sum, these problems are few and simple. You could boil them down to three interconnected areas of concern: risk of fraud/manipulation, market size and lack of regulation.

To create an ETF for a new asset, applicants must propose a rule change to accommodate that asset in the SEC’s legal framework, and this places the onus on the applicant to prove that the asset and its underlying market are consistent with regulations laid out in the Security and Exchange Act of 1933.

As the rejection would indicate, the Winklevosses’ preliminary attempt wasn’t convincing enough to the SEC.

“[The] Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change because it does not find the proposal to be consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect investors and the public interest.

“The Commission believes that, in order to meet this standard, an exchange that lists and trades shares of commodity-trust exchange-traded products (“ETPs”) must, in addition to other applicable requirements, satisfy two requirements that are dispositive in this matter. First, the exchange must have surveillance-sharing agreements with significant markets for trading the underlying commodity or derivatives on that commodity. And second, those markets must be regulated,” the order reads.

SolidX’s first crack at an ETF would be scrapped with the same verbiage, word for word, nearly three weeks following the Winklevosses’ rejection.

In 2013, when the Winklevosses’ ETF was filed — and in 2017 when it was summarily rejected — there were no federally regulated markets for bitcoin. Of course, the Winklevosses’ own Gemini Exchange is regulated via the New York State Department of Financial Services through one of the much-coveted BitLicenses. But the scale of this regulation is inconsequential to the SEC, so the twins’ first application was fighting a losing battle from the start.

Though by June 2017, they found an opening. The Cboe and CME exchanges launched the world’s first institutional bitcoin futures in December of 2017. By proxy, these were also the first fully federally regulated bitcoin products to trade in the United States.

So the Winklevosses took another stab at it, submitting a revised proposal and petition for review. This time around, the twins’ Gemini Exchange entered into a surveillance-sharing agreement with Cboe’s bitcoin futures market to appease the SEC’s request in the former rejection. As the name suggests, a surveillance-sharing agreement is a self-regulatory accord struck between two or more marketplaces in the same market to police fraud and manipulation. Sharing data and monitoring practices between Gemini and Cboe, then, would seemingly satisfy the SEC’s major concern with the prior application.

Still, the SEC was not impressed. In their filing, the Winklevosses et al. argue that the bitcoin market’s global nature makes bitcoin resistant to conventional mark manipulation tactics. Ironically, this argument backfired, as the SEC found that because of this global market, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust couldn’t possibly shield their potential investors from fraud, especially when you consider that the Gemini Exchange (which would source the ETF’s price data) accounts for a sliver of bitcoin’s daily transaction volume.

“BZX has not met its burden under the Exchange Act and the Commission’s Rules of Practice to demonstrate that its proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5), in particular the requirement that its rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,” the rejection reads.

Looking Toward the “Futures”
The rejection rationale detailed above would be copy-pasted practically verbatim into the nine rejection orders that would come in the following month, August 2018.

These filings by Direxion, ProShares and GraniteShares, however, didn’t source their price data from the underlying spot market. In fact, the contracts weren’t for physical bitcoin at all — they would be ETFs for bitcoin futures themselves.

The logic here is pragmatic if not a little obvious. Seeing as the Winklevosses were rejected a second time even if they entered into a surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated exchange, they must have not gone far enough. If the SEC is worried about the regulation status and integrity of the market, then the ETF (and its pricing data) must be based on a regulated market, not just surveillance-shared with it.

So Direxion, ProShares and GraniteShares followed in VanEck’s footsteps, which was the first to file for an ETF based on bitcoin futures, bizarrely, before a mainstream futures market even existed (this is why its proposal was initially withdrawn at the SEC’s request).

Unlike its counterpart in physical bitcoin ETFs, these products would divide shares of the Cboe’s and/or CME’s futures contracts, while naturally sourcing pricing data from these markets as well.

These ETFs all claim to have established a surveillance-sharing agreement with the CME’s and Cboe’s regulated futures markets. Even so, these agreements must be with a “market of significant size related to bitcoin,” and in the eyes of the SEC, the CME and Cboe aren’t there yet.

“While CME and [Cboe’s CFE] are regulated markets for bitcoin derivatives, there is no basis in the record for the Commission to conclude that these markets are of significant size,” the rejection notices read.

“Publicly available data show that the median daily notional trading volume, from inception through August 10, 2018, has been 14,185 bitcoins on CME and 5,184 bitcoins on CFE, and that the median daily notional value of open interest on CME and CFE during the same period has been 10,145 bitcoins and 5,601 bitcoins, respectively,” it continues.

With this data in mind, the SEC then says that extrapolating any “meaningful analysis” from this market volume is difficult “because reliable data about the spot market, including its overall size, are unavailable.”

Of course, these rejections were made at the staffing level and are pending review by the Commission itself, so while the staff's decision doesn't exactly inspire confidence, it could still be overturned by the SEC's senior decision makers.

Precedents and Disappointments
Almost all arguments against these ETFs make their way back to the spot market.

If the ETF prices its data from spot exchanges like Gemini, these markets are too small in the scope of bitcoin’s global trading to definitively defend against fraud. If the ETF prices its data from a regulated derivatives market, there’s no reliable way to measure the significance of this future’s volume against the overall market.

The SEC’s gravest concern when deliberating bitcoin ETF approvals has been related to fraud and manipulation; market size, asset liquidity and reliability of pricing data are also wrapped up in this primary concern. And these concerns don't even touch on the custody and settlement difficulties offerings would have to hurdle if they redeemed shares “in-kind” with bitcoin itself (there’s a reason most (if not all) of the filings since the Winklevosses’ own have opted to settle contracts in cash, instead).

Ironically, the biggest obstacle to regulating an ETF into existence, then, is the current dearth of regulated entities and structures in the bitcoin market at large. In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce hit on the catch-22 that the SEC’s rejection creates, as well as explaining that she feels their rejections set a disconcerting precedent for the SEC's power to vet or denounce the quality of an investment.

“If you really want this market to be more orderly,"" she said, ""then you’ve got to let some of these forces in that are going to bring order to it,” like an institution-grade product such as an ETF.

Peirce suggested that the rejection of the Winklevoss ETF in particular set a poor precedent. “It plays into a bit of a thread in securities regulations — at the federal and at the state level — which is that there’s an inclination among regulators to almost step into the shoes of the investor and say whether or not the investor should be making that particular decision, based on our assessment of the actual product — in this case, the actual asset. So yes, that is a disturbing precedent, because I can’t make assessments about those things,” she said in the interview.

So far, ETF news has been punctuated by overarching disappointment, but a number of decision-pending files are still crowding the SEC’s desk. As we mentioned earlier, currently, the ETFs pitched by Direxion, ProShares and GraniteShares are up for review by the Commission; VanEck and SolidX’s joint effort, as well as Bitwise’s sweeping ETF of popular coins, are still being reviewed.

This September, Abra’s CEO Bill Barhydt told CNBC that he would bet on an ETF being approved “in the next year,” and Peirce said she was “a bit optimistic” that one is coming. Barhydt believes the right suitor hasn’t called on the SEC yet, but that once it does, the ETF is inevitable, while Peirce thinks that there’s enough interest in the product for an eventual approval.

Until this eventually becomes reality, though, the industry is stuck waiting on what the SEC will do next — something that’s become a constant for 2018 and isn’t likely to change anytime soon.",REGULATION,0.3818
2018/11/14,New York Department of Financial Services Issues 14th BitLicense,"Today, November 14, 2018, the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) announced that it has approved the application of NYDIG Execution LLC, a subsidiary of NYDIG LLC, for a virtual currency license and a money transmission license. The approval of this so-called “BitLicense” or “Virtual Currency License” application is the 14th of its kind and is required under New York State law in order for a company to engage in “any Virtual Currency Business Activity.”

Under the BitLicense, NYDIG Execution LLC is allowed to offer secure custody and trade execution services, as well as to operate as a custodian for virtual currencies, including bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether, ripple and litecoin.

DFS Superintendent Maria T. Vullo approved the request, stating, “Today’s approval further demonstrates that operating within New York’s robust state regulatory system leads to a stronger fintech marketplace and promotes innovation and necessary compliance with effective risk-based controls.”

First enacted in August 2015, BitLicense regulations caused an outcry from the community. Some industry companies such as Circle pursued a BitLicense, and others such as itBit (now Paxos Trust Company) received approval to operate as a “chartered trust company” with DFS oversight. However, many left the state for more accomodating jurisdictions in what the New York Business Journal called “the Great Bitcoin Exodus,” citing overly burdensome regulatory hurdles, excessive disclosure requirements and financial disincentives in pursuing the license applications.

San Francisco–based exchange Kraken withdrew from servicing New York residents because of the state’s new licensing requirements. In a blog post titled “Farewell, New York,” the founders of Kraken stated, “Regrettably, the abominable BitLicense has awakened. It is a creature so foul, so cruel that not even Kraken possesses the courage or strength to face its nasty, big, pointy teeth.”

The process of granting Virtual Currency Licenses had been slow initially, with Coinbase acquiring the third-ever BitLicense in January 2017, 16 months after the final rules around virtual currencies were adopted. However, 2018 has seen a rise in the number of licenses granted, with nine this year, the seventh of which was awarded to ATM operator Coinsource only two weeks ago. NYDIG’s license comes eight months after a proposed alternative to BitLicense regulations was put forth in the New York State Assembly. As of this writing, that proposed legislation is still in committee.",REGULATION,0.9917
2018/11/16,“We Did This With Gold”: Could VanEck Be Bitcoin’s Best Bet for an ETF?,"Gabor Gurbacs is confident that the approval of a bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) is inevitable. And he’s optimistic that the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Strategy will be the first to deliver one to the world.

The director of Digital Asset Strategy at VanEck/MVIS, Gurbacs, as of late, has become a leading voice on the space’s ETF pursuit at a time when industry chatter on the topic has never been louder. If you haven’t found him extolling the benefits of a bitcoin ETF on Twitter, you may have come across his interviews on Anthony Pompliano’s podcast and Ran Neu-Ner’s Crypto Trader show for CNBC Africa.

“America wants a bitcoin ETF,” he told Ran Neu-Ner, “We’re close. It really depends on the SEC whether or when they’re going to approve it.”

To find out more about what an ETF is, what it would look like for bitcoin and who alongside VanEck is vying for one, check out our November cover story.

As confident as Gurbacs may appear, some might say the director is too confident in his surefire predictions. Historical precedent isn’t exactly in his favor, after all. The VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Strategy is one of only two proposals, the other being the Bitwise HOLD 10 Cryptocurrency Index Fund, that hasn’t seen a decision.  As for the other filings, the SEC has rejected nearly every proposal that has come across its desk, although its last nine rejections, which were made at the staff level, are still pending review by the Commission.

Even against these odds, Gurbacs believes VanEck and SolidX is poised to buck the trend, especially since the asset management firm has set its own precedent that Gurbacs thinks will swing odds in VanEck’s favor: a history of bringing institutional products to market.

A History of Firsts
“VanEck has a history of building international stock and gold investing, in the U.S. and abroad,” Gurbacs said in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine.

VanEck introduced the first gold equity mutual fund back in 1968 (the VanEck International Investors Gold Fund, which is still around), at a time when the global gold market accounted for a little over $200 million and gold was fixed at $35 per ounce. Half a century later — and with the gold standard for currency backing now obsolete in the U.S. — gold is at $1,200/ounce with a $7.4 trillion market cap and is considered “a global safe haven asset,” as Gurbacs put it. He attributes this growth and the store-of-value status gold has enjoyed since the ’60s to the institutionalization that high-grade investment assets like an equity fund or an ETF provide to the market.

As his favoritism toward gold might betray, VanEck’s founder, John van Eck, was actually a direct student of Austrian-American economist Ludwig von Mises, “one of the earliest gold bugs in the U.S.” In the 21st century, VanEck’s pursuit of a finite, globally recognized asset is proving to be generational. VanEck’s current CEO, Jan F. van Eck, John van Eck’s son, has been a pioneer of sorts, as well, leading the company to introduce what Gurbacs called “some of the first non-traditional ETFs” to the U.S. market. Under his direction in 2006, for instance, VanEck launched the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF, a “comprehensive portfolio of global gold miners,” according to VanEck’s website.

These gold-focused products were the successors both of the work John van Eck built with the world’s first gold equity mutual fund and of the philosophy his open attitude toward fringe assets instilled in his firm’s investment vision. Now, following in his father’s footsteps, Jan F. van Eck has taken to bitcoin with a similar forward-looking interest, just as his father did with gold decades earlier.

Jan F. van Eck, among others in the wider investment community, sees bitcoin as “somewhat of a digital gold,” Gurbacs said, so it makes sense that VanEck is going for gold again in its efforts to win the SEC’s approval for the world’s first bitcoin ETF.

VanEck’s interest in bitcoin also makes sense when you consider the market parallels between it and its old world predecessor. Much like its cryptographic counterpart, gold’s first investment vehicles were originally scrutinized as highly volatile, speculative assets, suffering from a stigma similar to the one that bitcoin has faced in its brief, nearly 10-year history.

“Back then, gold wasn’t sexy. It was like bitcoin a few years ago,” Gurbacs quipped.

A Bid to Make Bitcoin Appealing
The Bitcoin community and the crypto market as a whole seems to be clamoring for an ETF. But so far, the SEC has been holding off on giving its approval.

Gurbacs finds that the agency’s rejections stem from the same set of problems that applicants time and again have failed to address, namely “pricing, custody, liquidity and manipulation of the underlying asset.”

The sourcing data for these past filings comes from markets and exchanges that are too loosely structured for the SEC to take them seriously, as the underlying spot market is still unregulated on a federal level.

“Regulators were very keen on the fact that spot platforms like Coinbase, Gemini and the like are technically regulated entities but not really meant to be brokers for commodities,” said Gurbacs. “In some regulators’ eyes, these entities aren’t regulated,” even though platforms like Gemini and Coinbase are regulated on the state level in New York.

The cryptocurrency industry’s spot exchanges lack many of the investor protections that traditional markets feature by regulatory default, such as the surveillance-sharing strategies that the SEC has said are key prerequisites for getting an exchange trading product approved.

Gurbacs explained that, in the U.S., equities, commodities, futures and the ETF market make it so that “all of the market data is accessible to regulators should they subpoena or flag any suspicious activity.”

In an attempt to appease the SEC, applicants began to pivot toward the futures market in an attempt to give the regulator what it had been asking for: a market that is fully regulated under federal law.

VanEck actually started this trend, applying for the first bitcoin futures ETF at the tail-end of last year before the CME and Cboe began trading futures (this is why the SEC promptly asked the firm to withdraw its application twice).

The nine applications that were rejected at the staff level and then called up for revival by the Commission in September 2018 took a cue from VanEck, pricing their bitcoin futures ETFs from the now-live CME and Cboe futures contracts.

But these futures draw their own prices from the underlying spot markets of popular exchanges, something that played into the SEC staff’s initial rejection rationale. “CME Bitcoin futures are based on the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR), which aggregates bitcoin trading activity across major bitcoin spot exchanges,” the CME website states. For its part, the Cboe sources pricing data from the Gemini exchange, which Gurbacs points out only accounts for “a small percent of daily bitcoin trading volume on a good day.”

So, not only do these ETFs’ pricing sources lack a regulated market structure, but their transaction volume is too slim to guard against manipulation, the SEC’s thinking goes. And while they’re pending review by the Commission, Gurbacs thinks that, ultimately, there’s nothing novel enough about the filings to convince the SEC to change its mind.

“I don’t expect the SEC to walk back on its decision over those 9 ETFs because none of the providers solved any problems related to market structure issues that the SEC clearly outlined. I’m glad they’re reviewing and doing their jobs, but I don’t see any change.”

Forging the Way Forward
To avoid stumbling into the pitfalls of its competitors, VanEck has been careful to follow all of the SEC’s directions. In sum, this involved creating a market structure with more structural integrity than the one pitched to the SEC in other filings.

“We’ve met with regulators a few times and made sure we understand their questions, spending years — literally years — to answer those questions and build the proper market structure: what’s the right pricing, should surveillance be in place, how do you trade institutionally, how do hedge against market manipulation,” Gurbacs said.

These steps involve guaranteeing institutional-grade insurance for the fund, setting up proprietary custody arrangements with an undisclosed bank and settling the ETF’s shares in cash, rather than in-kind with bitcoin because, as Gurbacs put it, “unfortunately, the U.S. prime brokerage system and custody system is not set up to handle physical redemption in bitcoin right now.”

Proving its worth to the SEC also means that VanEck has to show that its pricing sources differ from competing applicants. To clear this hurdle, VanEck has built its own pricing source from the ground up, based on feedback from the SEC.

According to Gurbacs, the source draws from three established over-the-counter (OTC) pricing feeds from regulated broker dealers or affiliates of regulated broker dealers, though he couldn’t disclose further information as its currently not public. However, it is similar to an index that one of VanEck’s subsidiaries, MVIS, created in league with CryptoCompare. MVIS also features indices for many mainstream investment products, and Gurbacs believes that its bitcoin pricing feed subjects the fund to the same “rigorous practices, regulatory-driven disclosures and client protection rules” that the SEC wants to see in a bitcoin ETF.

The ETF Effect
The biggest underappreciated scaling platform for Bitcoin is the financial system.
Given VanEck’s commitment to fully addressing the SEC’s feedback, Gurbacs is hopeful that the VanEck and SolidX’s filing will be the first to win over the regulatory agency, and he attributes this optimism toVanEck’s “over a half of a century of history with U.S. regulators” in working to bring products to market.

Toward the end of our conversation, Gurbacs reiterated the company’s history of crafting first-of-their-kind products, returning to VanEck’s work with sponsoring the first gold equity fund in a nod to the commodities’ similarities to bitcoin. He hit on the meteoric growth gold enjoyed as a result of its institutionalization, and he stressed that bitcoin could experience a similar trend.

But when asked to clarify if he thinks that a bitcoin ETF would catapult the asset to new heights, Gurbacs hesitated. Instead, he insisted that it’s not about the price effect an ETF would have, but rather, what it will mean for legitimizing bitcoin and freeing up avenues for adoption.

“That’s tough for me. I’ll be up front: I do not like price prediction. I don’t think that’s the important part. Providing access to the assets in a regulated and globally accepted way is the important aspect of our efforts. I’m hoping that the impact is that people who previously couldn’t get involved with buying bitcoin will also get into the market; it’ll also help adoption.

“Bitcoin does not need an ETF, but it would benefit from having an ETF. An ETF would help bitcoin survive for at least 100 years. And I’m not kidding with this. There was gold trading before a gold fund or a gold ETF, but when the first product came out, the gold market grew tremendously, practically from $200 million to $7.4 trillion, and toward the end of the spectrum (5-10 years), volatility dampened and gold established itself as a global store of value — a government hedge, a hedge against global markets. Bitcoin is just like gold. It needs financialization in order to get more liquidity and achieve the status of a true store of value. Financialization is good for bitcoin. It helps liquidity, it helps adoption, it helps with scaling. The biggest underappreciated scaling platform for Bitcoin is the financial system.”

Bitcoin maximalists and the crypto community faithful might take issue with Gurbacs’ final statement. Some have made the argument that an ETF is fundamentally incompatible with bitcoin’s ethos. They have argued that instead of helping Bitcoin, an ETF would actually be a stain on the industry.

It seems that this is one area where bitcoiners and the SEC can find common ground, seeing as they’re both likely to argue that bitcoin should not be subsumed by the traditional financial sector. But Gurbacs, who holds that the “ETF is, in some ways the most trust-minimized of all trading vehicles,” believes that there’s common ground still that both sides are ignoring.

“We built our ETF so that it stays closer the core values of Bitcoin: holding physical bitcoin, providing verifiable, issued supply so there are no reserves that are unaccounted for.”

He added: “Bitcoin maximalists don’t talk about the middle ground where Bitcoin does fit into the U.S. capital market — and on the regulatory side, arguments also always go that it can’t fit in it.”

Rounding out our talk, Gurbacs echoed Hester Peirce’s own interview with Bitcoin Magazine, insisting that the demand for an ETF is too high to ignore. He also thinks that the SEC would be doing more harm than good by restricting free-market access to a sounder investment vehicle than is currently available on the market.

“The SEC’s job is to keep a fair and orderly market and protect investors. Regulators shouldn't say that ‘bitcoin is not a good asset and therefore we’re not going to let an ETF happen.’ They should evaluate whether the disclosures are right or not and let the market decide whether the asset has merit. I think regulators have made merit based decisions before, and regulators might have implied bitcoin has no merit. Given that this is a new asset class, they’re a little afraid.

“Right now the regulatory environment not approving an ETF fosters this grey-area activity. Lightly regulated trading platforms, which often operate without investors having any regulatory recourse, force investors into a grey area, versus giving them something like an ETF, a fund structure that has decades of history and fits into a proper regulatory regime and has customer protections. My biggest frustration is: how is it possible that a well-constructed, insured, liquid ETF is not ok — but it’s ok for random technology companies, with often no license, to sell bitcoin in the U.S.? It’s kind of weird. So, by not making a decision and not letting an ETF set a higher standard, this gray area of activity is fostered and the whole U.S. principle of free market competition is also violated, and the SEC’s principles of protecting investors and ensuring fair and orderly markets is violated.”

With VanEck’s current filing slated for a decision by December 29, 2018 — or February 28, 2019 at the latest, if there is a delay — Gurbacs might get his wish. Even if he doesn’t, the director insinuated that the firm will continue to wrestle for an institution-grade product, however long that may take.

“We’ll continue to engage and fight this fight to do our part as an asset manager to help the digital asset space mature. So it may not be a short fight — I don’t know. But we have done this with gold in the ’60s, and hopefully now, we’re building the right basis that will stay true to bitcoin as well as integrate it into the U.S. capital markets.”",REGULATION,0.6369
2018/11/19,New Cryptocurrency-Based ETP Arrives in Switzerland,"Amun AG, a startup in Zug, Switzerland, has received a license from Swiss authorities to offer a new cryptocurrency exchange-traded product (ETP).

An ETP is a blanket term to denote a security that derives its price from an underlying asset (e.g. a currency, commodity, stock) and is traded on a regulated stock exchange. It could refer to a number of exchange-traded investment options, including exchange-traded funds (ETF), exchange-traded commodities (ETC) and exchange-traded notes (ETN).

Anum has referred to the instrument only as an ETP, and it’s unclear at this time whether or not it is characteristically an ETF, ETC or an ETN.

Amun AG has stated that its ETP will be based on a collection of the top five most liquid crypto assets, which it refers to as “HODL5.” The currencies contained within the ETP will be bitcoin, ether, Ripple’s XRP, litecoin and bitcoin cash. The company will purchase cryptocurrency using cash from its customers. The assets will then be transferred into custodial hands, for which the company will charge management fees of roughly 2.5 percent.

The fund also sources its pricing from the MVIS, an index for institutional-grade price tracking that was developed by VanEck.

Amun’s CEO Hany Rashwan explains, “The Amun ETP will give institutional investors that are restricted to investing only in securities or do not want to set up custody for digital assets exposure to cryptocurrencies. It will also provide access for retail investors that currently have no access to crypto exchanges due to local regulatory impediments.”

The ETP will be traded on SIX Swiss Exchange, the country’s official stock exchange. Based in Zurich, the platform earned well over $100 billion during the first half of 2018 and is estimated to be worth over $1 trillion.

Big league financial players in the U.S. have struggled to get a cryptocurrency-based ETF on track for years without success. Some of the industry’s biggest players, like the Winklevosses’ Gemini Exchange in New York, have submitted applications for bitcoin ETFs only to be slapped down by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Currently, nine applications that were formerly rejected by the SEC’s staff are pending review by the agency’s Commission, and a bitcoin ETF pitched by VanEck in collaboration with SolidX is awaiting a decision.

In August 2018, American investors were given their first access to an exchange-traded note (ETN) called the “Bitcoin Tracker One” on the Nasdaq Stockholm Exchange in Sweden, first established in 2015. Unlike an ETF, which issues shares of an underlying asset, an ETN is akin to a bond. It is an unsecured debt note that can be bought and traded until it reaches its maturity date, at which time the debt on the note must be repaid.

Prior to August of 2018, investors had only been able to buy into the ETN using either euros or the kora, Sweden’s national currency, and the tracker’s USD listing paved the way for more western interest.

Less than a month later, however, the SEC suspended American access to the Bitcoin Tracker One and Ether Tracker One, another ETN issued by the Swedish company XBT Provider AB. The SEC cited investor confusion as the primary reason for blocking investors from taking part in either venture.",REGULATION,-0.3073
2018/11/19,Federal Election Commission Gives Green Light for Political Mining Pool Donations,"The U.S. Federal Election Commission (FEC) has given tacit permission for mining pools to donate to political campaigns.

The FEC released a memo on their website on November 13, 2018, to provide background information to a formal meeting that would take place on November 15. In it, they addressed a recent request filed by OsiaNetwork LLC for the FEC’s advisory opinion.

OsiaNetwork filed this request on September 10, 2018, asking for confirmation on the “permissibility of OsiaNetwork’s business plan.” With little other information publicly available about this startup, it seems as if this decision may have been the dealbreaker for the whole company’s existence.

This business model is stated quite simply in OsiaNetwork’s request to “enable individuals to support federal political committees by volunteering the processing power of their internet enabled devices to mine cryptocurrencies.” And now, the FEC has responded.

In a move that may spell trouble for OsiaNetwork, but ultimately might add more dynamism to the space as a whole, the FEC decided that “although the proposed cryptocurrency mining pool as described in the request is itself permissible under the Act and Commission regulations, the activities of the individuals do not fall within the volunteer internet activities exception, and would therefore result in contributions from them and from OsiaNetwork to the participating political committees.”

In other words, it seems permissible for mining pools themselves to undertake the effort to donate to political campaigns, and it is still possible for OsiaNetwork to set up these mining pools, but they are not able to enter any kind of extended relationship wherein they act as a sort of middleman.

OsiaNetwork is not able to contribute to the campaigns itself, and this may preclude a more long-term relationship with the pool it sets up. The request specifically mentioned stipulations to their ideal donations, such as “as long as each of those political committees is a client of OsiaNetwork.”

The FEC’s decision to ban this kind of relationship and uphold private donations themselves may ultimately provide more flexibility for those interested in donating cryptocurrency via mining pools. OsiaNetwork’s plan to make a profit from this scheme was apparently centered around establishing themselves as an institutionalized actor for mining pools of this nature, but it’s possible that the transactions would work just as fine in a decentralized fashion.",REGULATION,0.9492
2018/11/22,Gibraltar's Regulator Grants Full License to the Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange,"The Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange (GBX) has been granted a license from the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC) required to operate a regulated blockchain exchange.

“Securing authorization as a DLT provider here in Gibraltar is affirmation of our tireless efforts to position the GBX among the premiere Digital Asset Exchanges globally. Today’s announcement renews our ambition to create a world leading, institutional-grade token sale platform and Digital Asset Exchange,” Nick Cowan, CEO of the GBX, said in a statement.

Cowan went on to explain that the exchange's goal from the beginning was to build a regulated exchange with ""effective risk-based controls."" While the road was long and difficult, the endorsement from Gibraltar's financial regulator is testament to the exchange's long held position and ""evidence of the hard work"" that brought them far.

Speaking of how far they have come, it took the exchange roughly 180 days to attain the coveted license from the commission.

There was a series of communications with the regulator followed by an initial risk assessment of their application. GBX was then required to make a presentation to the GFSC, detailing its business plan and how the exchange plans to abide by the Commission's Distributed Ledger Technology Regulatory Framework.

The Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange, which runs an initial coin offering marketplace, is a subsidiary of the Gibraltar Stock Exchange Group (GSX Group). It was launched in 2017 by the GSX Group through an initial coin offering (ICO).

GBX also offers crypto trading, which it opened to the public in July 2018. Dubbed the GBX Digital Asset Exchange, the platform allows investors to trade in bitcoin, ether, bitcoin cash, ethereum classic and the exchange's native token the Rock Token (RKT). Similar to how Binance Coin works, GBX traders can also use the RKT Coin to pay for trading, listing and sponsor fees on the platform.

The platform also offers fiat to token trading for its customers, particularly with USD pairs, but there are plans to widen the net to accommodate other fiat currencies on the exchange as well as a list of other trading pairs.

“Gibraltar has found the right blend of sensible and supportive regulation, which has helped position the jurisdiction as a lodestar for the global cryptocurrency space, while allowing blockchain companies to flourish. Crucially, here in Gibraltar there has been a realization that the pursuit of innovation should never come at the expense of sustainability and long-term development. I look forward to seeing this trend continue in the months and years ahead,” Cowan concluded.",REGULATION,0.2263
2018/11/28,"In Cautionary Speech, Chairman Clayton Parrots SEC’s Bitcoin ETF Concerns","Speaking at the ongoing CoinDesk's Consensus Invest conference in New York, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton spoke on why his agency hasn’t yet approved a bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF). But the rationale behind his words is nothing his crypto-friendly audience hasn’t heard before.

Clayton explained that his agency might not approve a bitcoin ETF anytime soon as the agency's issues are yet to be addressed by market operators. Clayton singled out theft and manipulation of cryptocurrencies as two issues that need to be sorted out before the commission can give its blessings to an ETF, something that prior rejection orders have repeated ad infinitum.

In these rejection orders, the SEC claims that each applicant has failed “to demonstrate that its proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5), in particular the requirement that its rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,” continuing to say that “novel systems intrinsic to this new market provide unique additional protections that are unavailable in traditional commodity markets,” namely “traditional means of identifying and deterring fraud and manipulation.”

These “traditional means” are surveillance sharing agreements, something the rejection orders stress as one of the avenues through which a product might win approval. In his own talk, Chairman Clayton opined that this surveillance, a system used by the likes of Nasdaq to investigate manipulative trading activities, could keep tabs on manipulative practices and ensure fair pricing.

He believes investors want certain upgrades in fraud protection and market surveillance, both of which ""[do] not exist currently in all of the exchange venues where digital currencies trade."" 

Clayton also reiterated the crux of the SEC’s rejections in his talk; namely, that the underlying market is too fraught with manipulation to allow a mainstream investing product, as this would expose investors to unmanaged risks.

“What investors expect is that the trading in that commodity that’s underlying the ETF is trading that makes sense, is free from the risk or significant risk of manipulation. Those kinds of safeguards don’t exist in many of the markets where digital currencies trade,” the SEC chairman explained in a panel session moderated by Silver Lake Partner's Glenn Hutchins.

Market manipulation aside, the issue of custody is another obstacle that has kept ETFs from seeing the light of day. The custody of digital assets needs to improve, considering the wave of hacks and crypto thefts that have occurred in 2018, Clayton asserted.

""We've seen some thefts around digital assets that make you scratch your head. We care that the assets underlying that ETF have good custody, and that they're not going to disappear.""

On the issue of custody, it's been a flurry of activity from both crypto and financial institutions alike. Coinbase launched a custody solution as far back as August 2018, while Fidelity, through its crypto arm Fidelity Digital Assets, started its enterprise-grade custody solution in October. Not to be left behind, American multinational investment bank Citigroup announced plans to offer crypto custody solutions in September. Gemini, Ledger and ItBit are also working on floating a similar service. With the number of options that abound, the SEC chair believes there is room for improvement.

So far in 2018, the agency has rejected the ETF application from the Winklevoss Twins, along with nine others that, after rejection at the staffing level, are currently being reviewed by the Commission itself. It has also postponed its decision on the VanEck SolidX ETF case till February 2019 at the latest. Even in spite of this postponement (and the SEC’s revolving door of rejections and cautious stance against a bitcoin ETF), VanEck’s director of Digital Asset Strategy, Gabor Gurbacs, is confident that VanEck’s filing has checked all of the SEC’s boxes.",REGULATION,0.3182
2018/11/30,“Guidance by Enforcement”: How the SEC Is Slowly Shaping ICO Regulation,"On November 27, 2018, a California judge turned back the SEC’s request for an injunction against token company BlockVest, a company the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is pursuing for allegedly conducting an unregistered securities offering. The judge, however, ruled that BlockVest’s token distribution, which was conducted via airdrop, was given freely and received without expectation for returns, so it didn’t constitute an investment contract.

While the judge’s ruling is not a law-binding verdict, it was still a victory for BlockVest and the wider ICO industry, something that’s been a rarity for the SEC’s mounting list of token sale targets.

Among other regulatory developments, 2018 has been one extended game of cat and mouse between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and any number of initial coin offerings (ICO) that have sprung up in the investing exuberance of 2017’s bull market. And the SEC has been catching its fair share of mice.

Back in last year’s unprecedented boom, which saw the crypto market’s assets increase threefold, many ICOs attempted to evade the SEC’s scrutiny by self-labeling their products as utility tokens. If they could prove their tokens were built to serve a function rather than exist as an investment vehicle, then they could avoid a securities classification and continue their sale without registering with the SEC.

The SEC, though, didn’t buy the distinction.

So far this year, the SEC has come out hard against a handful of ICOs, broker dealers, funds and even an exchange, slapping them with fines for acting as unregistered entities. As though a symbolic culmination of its enforcement actions this year, the SEC’s most recent and damning charge was leveraged against EtherDelta, one of the space’s most popular decentralized exchanges that houses many Ethereum tokens whose ICOs the SEC views as securities offerings.

A New Phase of Enforcement
In correspondence with Bitcoin Magazine, Jake Chervinsky, an associate at Kobre & Kim law firm, explained that he believes the SEC established a baseline of enforcement in 2018, one that sets a precedent for how the agency views the burgeoning ecosystem of token offerings.  

“I think ‘phase one’ saw the SEC establish its fundamental views on the legality of common issues in the crypto industry by prosecuting a small number of companies and individuals from various industry segments, including ICO issuers, exchanges, broker-dealers, and token funds. The SEC’s goal was to put everyone on notice that their conduct may be illegal — for example, it’s clear that the SEC views all ICOs conducted in the United States as unregistered securities issuances in violation of the 1933 Act.”

Chervinsky originally posited his theory on the SEC’s enforcement phases in a Twitter thread this November. In the thread, he suggested that 2019 will see phase two; in our conversation, he explained that the SEC is operating under the unspoken expectation that token projects will have to work with the agency to operate legally, as 2018’s enforcement examples have done all the talking for them.

“In ‘phase two,’ the SEC expects everyone in the industry to come forward voluntarily and work with the SEC to make sure they’re in compliance with the securities laws. As SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said to crypto companies during Consensus: Invest 2018: ‘Get your act together!’”  

For those that fail to acquiesce, Chervinsky anticipates that they could be made examples of still.

“The SEC will likely prosecute companies that refuse to comply voluntarily. In the end, the SEC’s goal will be to bring the entire industry into compliance with the securities laws, even if that means dozens or hundreds of different companies.”

Basically, the SEC’s rationale is that token companies have no excuse not to register with the agency. They should operate under the assumption that they’ll be treated like a security, unless they can prove otherwise. But the onus is on the company to show why they don’t fit the mold, and simply calling their offering a utility token doesn’t cut it.

Moreover, these token companies have a library of enforcements and charges to consult when in doubt over their securities status. Chervinsky calls this “guidance by enforcement,” an old dog’s trick that the SEC has used in the past. For this new industry, Chervinsky believes that the SEC went after the easiest targets to set firm examples at the outset.

“They chose the ones that they did simply because they were the easiest for the SEC to resolve quickly and efficiently, and the factual allegations in these public cases made for useful guidance for the rest of the industry.”

These examples set a loose standard for token projects going into 2019 “for other crypto industry stakeholders to negotiate their own settlements,” Chervinsky holds. But he cautioned that “these orders are not binding precedent.”

Indeed, in his Twitter thread, Chervinsky elaborates that, for the SEC, the more nebulous the guidance the better. If the SEC plays it loose, then they get to set the rules on their own terms and exercise enforcement at their discretion. Most of these cases, he explains, are settled privately, and the SEC would rather avoid open litigation, as a few court rulings could lead to legal precedents that would lock the SEC’s jurisdiction in rigid, codified confines.

As Enforcement Ramps Up, Guidance Plays Catch Up
Still, Chervinsky expects “that the SEC will provide additional guidance as time goes on, likely through FinHub and ‘crypto czar’ Valerie Szczepanik” — though he’s also certain that the SEC shouldn’t have to hold the guiding torch of regulation alone. The U.S.’s legislature, he says, needs to do its own part to effect the proper legislative changes that would allow regulations, and by proxy, the entities they regulate, to operate more organically within a more mature system.

“I think Congress can — and eventually will need to — do more to clarify how the federal securities laws apply to digital assets. The foundation of the securities laws dates back to the 1930s, long before anyone could have imagined the concept of a digital asset issued via the internet through the use of blockchain technology. This old legal framework simply wasn’t designed for the digital age, and as a result, it doesn’t provide the regulatory clarity that the crypto industry needs to move forward.”

So far, there have been very few benchmarks for moving regulation forward: the Howey Test, a metric to measure whether or not an asset is a security as defined by the Securities Act of 1933; the DAO Report, a report released by the SEC after the DAO hack in 2016; prior enforcement actions; and, most recently, the SEC’s Statement on Digital Asset Securities Issuance and Trading (something that Chervinsky said “reads like a comprehensive primer on the types of securities violations that the SEC wants to resolve in the industry”).

Much like the outdated Securities Act, Chervinsky finds that these various references for guidance are not robust enough to substantiate actual regulation and satisfy the industry’s need for clarity. And even though he thinks Congress should be bringing more to the table than it has already, the SEC should also be doing more to help the industry.

“The SEC can and should do a lot more than regulate by enforcement. The SEC could issue informal guidance explaining its position on the many outstanding questions facing the crypto industry, such as when a token transforms from a security to a non-security, or how a company can conduct an ICO outside U.S. borders without implicating the SEC’s jurisdiction. The SEC could also pursue official rulemaking to formalize its positions on digital assets. This would result in enforceable rules — like Regulation D for private placements or Regulation S for offshore securities issuances — that the crypto industry could rely on moving forward.”

He added:

“... Similarly the securities laws are unclear as to whether the SEC has jurisdiction over cryptocurrency exchanges and initial coin offerings located physically outside U.S. borders. Given that the SEC doesn’t appear likely to provide any additional clarity on these issues, the burden may fall to Congress to step in and take action.”

Heading Into a New Year, the Industry Has More Questions Than Answers
Other legal experts agree with Chervinsky that the SEC, in a way, has left investors hanging with its sluggish regulatory action that is punctuated with hard-hitting regulatory charges. Some have even said that the new Statement on Digital Asset Securities Issuance and Trading lays a minefield for the digital asset industry and those launching companies to curate it.

Less a minefield and more a labyrinth, Chervinsky believes that some of the SEC’s other guidance, like the clarification that ether, while sold as a security, has decentralized to the point of not being one, could construct a maze of confusion over what counts as fully decentralized — and how a token company is supposed to get there in the first place.

Chervinsky notes that “in July, the SEC suggested that a digital asset could start life as a security and then evolve into a non-security once it becomes ‘sufficiently decentralized,’ but the law doesn’t contemplate such a transformation.”

Even so, with its prosecution of ICOs, broker dealers, funds and now an exchange in EtherDelta, Chervinsky believes that the SEC has “made an example of at least one target in each of the key segments of the crypto industry.”

The only piece missing, he believes, are the traders — those who engage in “acts of market manipulation, including pump and dump schemes, wash trading, spoofing, and outright fraud.” He believes the SEC hasn’t gone after these actors because of insufficient market data but that they’ll be in the agency’s crosshairs soon enough. (If you read this and your heart skipped a beat, don’t worry; he’s talking about traders who actively commit market manipulation and fraud, not everyday, Dick and Jane traders).

With all the pieces in place, Chervinsky expects 2019 to be somewhat of an open season for the SEC for those who decide to shirk their regulatory responsibilities. But that doesn’t mean that every shot will be a killshot. With each successive enforcement, more questions will be opened and more avenues of interpretation traversed.

In Chervinsky’s opinion, resolution on these fronts will be a slow, painful march marked by a combination of legal battles and molasses-paced legislative drafting.

“The crypto industry won’t have a firm standard for what conduct is allowed and what’s illegal until Congress passes new legislation or the SEC’s theories are tested in court.”

Some of these standards are in the making, as the recent court action in California surrounding BlockVest suggests. As for the rest, the industry will have to hunker down and withstand the brunt of what’s become a slow, blow-after-blow exchange with an evolving regulatory landscape. But, so long as it can take note of where the bruising has set in, these blows should become less damaging (and less frequent) over time.",REGULATION,0.9505
2018/12/3,This Year's G20 Put an Emphasis on Cryptocurrency Regulation,"Global leaders walked away from the latest G20 Summit with a rough game plan for crypto regulation.

This year’s G20 Summit took place in Buenos Aires, Argentina, from November 30 to December 1. International government officials, as well as some of the world’s largest corporations including Bank of America, Inter-American Development Bank, the World Trade Organization and the World Health Organization, gathered to discuss topics ranging from infrastructural development to sustainable food sourcing.

Among the topics examined at the summit included the creation of an open and resilient financial system that followed international laws and supported sustainable economic growth for all participants, at which point the subject of cryptocurrencies was brought up.

Eager to battle both money laundering and fraud in the financial market, leaders explained that they are looking to imprint stronger regulatory tactics on both cryptocurrency and blockchain businesses.

“We will regulate crypto-assets for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism in line with FATF [Financial Action Task Force] standards and we will consider other responses as needed,” a summary of the summit reads.

Members also explained that they would explore the extradition of individuals responsible for stealing assets to regions where the offenses took place. Leaders of the summit say they’re now tasking relevant international organizations with reporting back to them on this and similar issues through the next meeting.

It’s unclear whether or not the summit’s member countries will actually adopt this measure. Crypto theft was not specifically discussed, and it’s unclear if participants were referring to virtual currencies or simply fiat when examining the subject of asset theft.

In addition, summit members acknowledged that the global financial infrastructure is becoming more digitized and have sought to take stronger measures for sustaining finance and strengthening financial inclusion of otherwise non-participating regions. They are endorsing the G20 Financial Inclusion Policy guide, which seeks to provide voluntary policy recommendations to countries and organizations looking to facilitate digital financial services.

The summit also focused on tax efforts, mentioning that it is working on a “globally fair, sustainable and modern international tax system” based on tax treaties and transfer pricing rules. They are welcoming international cooperation to further pro-growth tax policies.

“We will continue to work together to seek a consensus-based solution to address the impacts of the digitalization of the economy on the international tax system with an update in 2019 and a final report by 2020,” the summary continues to read, though it is unclear whether or not this solution will apply to cryptocurrencies or just digital fiat currency.

One of the biggest issues facing the cryptocurrency arena is that its tax laws are not clear. Many attempts have been made to encourage governing bodies, both national and abroad, to clarify present tax laws surrounding crypto assets and relative trades.",REGULATION,0.9351
2018/12/4,"As It Ramps Up Enforcement, the SEC Has Been Looking Abroad for Assistance","2018 has been a hallmark year for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s enforcement against cryptocurrency companies, and, according to one director, international collaboration with other regulatory agencies has played a supporting role in the SEC’s recent regulatory actions.

Steven Peikin, co-director of the Division of Enforcement at the SEC, has credited international collaboration as a useful weapon in the agency's arsenal for bringing fraudulent or unregistered actors to justice. Peikin made this opinion known at a speech he delivered at the Harvard Law School’s Program on International Financial Systems (PIFS) for Regulators of Securities Markets on December 3, 2018.

Peikin leads a team of attorneys and accountants who investigate and prosecute civil violations of U.S. federal securities laws. According to him, his division has the ""daunting task of ferreting out misconduct and, where appropriate, recommending civil enforcement actions that variously seek injunctions or cease-and-desist orders, penalties, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, suspensions and bars of bad actors, and the temporary suspension or delisting of securities.""

They have been involved in cases like the recent settlement of charges against music producer DJ Khaled and Floyd Mayweather Jr., who were both charged for touting crypto offerings. The team also charged and reached a settlement with EtherDelta co-founder Zachary Coburn for flouting federal securities laws by operating an unregistered national securities exchange.

On the topic of his division’s track record of enforcement, Peikin praised the SEC's ""collaboration with international regulators and law enforcement"" as being a critical element that made it possible.

""Our investigations often involve witnesses and evidence in different countries, transactions that cross international boundaries, and the resulting application of multiple different legal systems.""

The SEC director also highlighted the separate types of securities law violations in the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) space and how collaboration with their counterparts overseas has helped the agency protect the market from dubious actors.

The first group includes ICOs that meet the criteria of a security and are in violation of federal securities law for registration failures. The second category are fraudulent ICOs where the issuers use the ""excitement around the crypto asset space to simply rip off money from investors.""

Late last year, the agency obtained an emergency asset freeze against Dominic Lacroix, his partner Sabrina Paradis-Royer and the company PlexCorps for marketing and selling PlexCoin to unsuspecting investors in August 2017. The token sale is a case-and-point example of the type of blatantly fraudulent activity the SEC has sought to punish in 2018.

The founders had promised an absurd 1,354 percent profit in less than 29 days, having raised $15 million from global investors. “We learned of this ICO from our counterparts at the AMF [Authorité des marchés financiers] in Quebec, who provided us with important evidence in support of our complaint and motion for emergency relief,” Peikin said in his speech.

""Staff at the AMF provided declarations in our proceeding, which the court relied on in ruling against the defendants,"" he continued.

Peikin said the agency would continue to work with its global partners as it develops its ongoing ICO investigations. His argument shares the sentiment of the recently held G20 Summit in Buenos Aires. At the summit, world leaders came together to discuss, among other topics, the need to regulate “crypto-assets for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism in line with FATF [Financial Action Task Force] standards.”",REGULATION,-0.0258
2018/12/7,U.S. SEC Delays Decision on VanEck's Bitcoin ETF Until February 2019,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its decision to approve or disapprove the VanEck/SolidX bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Per an official document published by the agency, the new deadline to review the VanEck proposal has been shifted to February 27, 2019, which the regulator claims would afford it the time needed to review the potential rule change further.

The SEC stipulates that the commission must either approve or disapprove a proposal no later than ""180 days after the date of publication of notice of the filing of the proposed rule change."" However, there is a special clause that permits the agency to extend this period by 60 days. 

Since the proposed rule change was initially published in the Federal Register on July 2, 2018, December 29, 2018, would have made it 180 days. The extension to February 27, 2019, falls within the 60-day special consideration.

The statement from the SEC reads:

“The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider this proposed rule change.”

The director of Digital Asset Strategy at VanEck/MVIS, Gabor Gurbacs, remains optimistic despite the delay from the financial regulator. He sent out a tweet saying while today's delay was expected, the SEC's concerns are being worked on and rectified in the form of ""improvements in the markets on pricing, custody & surveillance.""

Speaking at a recent event in New York, the SEC Chairman Jay Clayton spoke on why the commission might not approve a bitcoin ETF soon. Clayton had argued that most of the agency's concerns, such as market manipulations, surveillance, and custody, were yet to be addressed by crypto operators.

“What investors expect is that the trading in that commodity that’s underlying the ETF is trading that makes sense, is free from the risk or significant risk of manipulation. Those kinds of safeguards don’t exist in many of the markets where digital currencies trade,” Clayton had remarked.",REGULATION,0.9173
2018/12/19,French National Assembly Rejects Plan to Loosen Crypto Taxes,"The National Assembly in France has recently shot down proposals to ease up the pressure on tax regulations in the crypto space.

As reported by Bitcoin.fr, there recently existed a series of proposals to present a friendlier environment to cryptocurrency firms in France, none of which were able to pass the lower house of the nation’s legislature.  

The report listed several proposed amendments to the French tax code, many of which hardly seem like radical ideas. For example, Amendment 399 was apparently intended to clarify distinctions between occasional usage of crypto assets with routine transactions, without any reference to trying to take advantage of either classification. A similar amendment to defer payment of capital gains taxes until crypto assets were converted into fiat also failed.

In addition to these, however, were more substantial measures specifically intended to make cryptocurrencies more attractive. One proposed amendment listed figures of 5,000, 3,000 and 305 Euros as annual tax exemptions for usage of cryptocurrency. None passed. Another amendment aimed at allowing cryptocurrency taxation laws to more closely resemble traditional capital gains tax laws was shuttered unceremoniously as well.

France’s tax policies as of late have captured the imaginations of the world’s presses. French president Emmanuel Macron has attempted to enact policies of austerity and cuts to social safety nets while continuing to raise taxes on gasoline that millions of French citizens consider a basic necessity to travel and hold a job.

The resultant “Yellow Vest” riots are far from able to overwhelm the government entirely at present, but they serve as a grim reminder to the legislature that the French Republic has collapsed entirely multiple times within the last century and had close calls as recently as 1968. In light of these current events, it may simply be that the French government is feeling skittish about showing any more favoritism with its tax policies.

In other words, this rejection could have very little to do with the overall viability of cryptocurrencies in France. This is an extremely hot time in the French political scene, and the crypto bear market may not be doing proposed amendments such as these any favors.",REGULATION,-0.7989
2018/12/20,British Revenue and Customs Agency Clarifies Law on Crypto Taxes,"The British government has recently released a policy paper clarifying the tax laws on crypto assets.

This fairly straightforward document was released on Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs’ (HRMC) website, holding a sundry list of important crypto space terms, the relevant tax codes and points of intersection between the two.

The report claims that “the cryptoassets sector is fast-moving and developing all the time,” and that much of the terminology described in the report may only be situationally accurate or subject to change. As a result, it prefaces most of the information with a disclaimer that its “views may evolve further as the sector develops.”

The report then launches into a fairly comprehensive list of crypto-specific terminology to act as a primer before describing some of the situations where different taxes are applicable. For example, “HMRC does not consider the buying and selling of cryptoassets to be the same as gambling,” as it instead claims that “in the vast majority of cases, individuals hold cryptoassets as a personal investment.”

There are a great number of situational circumstances outlined in the document wherein an investor would have to pay taxes. It states that “[they] will be liable to pay Capital Gains Tax when they dispose of their cryptoassets.” Additionally, it describes scenarios where crypto gains could fall under income tax or even inheritance tax, the latter of which regards crypto assets as any other property.

The document also comes complete with hypothetical scenarios and contingency plans for investors being defrauded and generally seems to be a complete guide to the digital asset class’ standing in the U.K.

Dry texts such as this, while offering clarity, also point to crypto’s legitimization in the eyes of the government. As evidenced by statutes like the provision for crypto inheritance, for example, entire departments of English bureaucrats are coming to see crypto assets as another investiture of money.",REGULATION,0.2263
2018/12/27,India May Legalize Bitcoin Under “Strong” Rules,"India could be making a U-turn on its directives for cryptocurrencies. Per reports from the New India Express, a second interdisciplinary committee set up by the Indian government is considering making cryptocurrencies legal in the country again but with more stringent rules.

This revelation comes just a few months after a government panel suggested the creation of a new regulatory framework within the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that bans digital assets and declares crypto transactions illegal in India.

According to an unnamed senior official who spoke with the New India Express, the committee had met twice, but deliberations were still ongoing.

“We have already had two meetings. There is a general consensus that cryptocurrency cannot be dismissed as completely illegal. It needs to be legalized with strong riders. Deliberations are on. We will have more clarity soon.”

The first interdisciplinary committee on cryptocurrency was set up by the government of India back in March 2017, including Ministry of Finance officials. This committee consisted of various banking and state departments. Following a recommendation from the committee, the RBI directed all banks and other financial entities in the country to refrain from transacting with digital assets.

However, the second committee, which was convened by Subhash Chandra Garg, the Secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs, was set up to review the resolutions of the first and look into the viability of cryptocurrencies for the Indian economy.

Some members of the second committee also attended the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, where crypto measures such as taxation and increased regulation to combat the use of cryptocurrencies for money laundering were discussed.

The members will be meeting in January to discuss some of the insights gained from the summit, before presenting its recommendations to the government.

“We have also taken inputs from cryptocurrency exchanges and experts and will be examining legal issues with the law ministry. It’s a complicated issue. Once all aspects are decided, then we will have more clarity,” the senior official explained in the report.

While the committee might suggest softening the stance on cryptocurrencies, local government authorities have not been handling the sector with kid gloves since the ban was enforced.

Earlier this year, the developers of India's first bitcoin automated teller machine (ATM) and the founders of the country's first crypto exchange, Unocoin, were arrested by local Bangalore authorities on criminal charges, including criminal conspiracy, cheating and forgery.",REGULATION,-0.9778
2018/12/28,There May Be (Some) Tax Relief Options if You Sold Your Bitcoin at a Loss,"For investors whose first time investing in bitcoin was in 2018 or after late 2017, there is a high likelihood that they have incurred substantial losses for the fiscal year of 2018 if they haven’t sold yet. On December 17, 2017, bitcoin hit an all-time high at over $19,000. Thereafter, it has fallen over 80 percent and now hovers at around $4,000 at the time of writing. While losing money is never the end goal, there are certain measures investors can take in order to minimize their taxable income by utilizing their capital losses incurred from bitcoin during the current year and going forward.

Before diving into what measures can be taken, it is first necessary to address how the regulatory bodies who set these precedences view bitcoin and similar assets. Although this piece is centered on the U.S. regulatory requirements applied to bitcoin, it is worth noting that many other countries have similar regulations internationally.

Bitcoin Is Property
According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), bitcoin is considered personal property. As such, any tax laws applicable to the sale of a house or car, or more similarly, a security, will also apply to the digital currency.

Specifically, the IRS refers to taxes levied on the sale of an asset as capital gains tax, for which there are two types. Long-term capital gains tax applies to profits on assets held over a year, while short-term capital gains taxes apply to assets held for less than a year. Short-term capital gains are taxed at the same rate as an individual’s ordinary income tax rate, which in 2018 was somewhere between 10 percent and 37 percent, depending on your level of income. On the other hand, in 2018, the long-term capital gains tax rates are either 0 percent, 15 percent or 20 percent. The applicable rate used for the calculation is dependent on the level of income.

However, in this article we are discussing the opposite of gains, as there are probably very few who profited in 2018’s bear market. Capital gains tax rates are relevant to taxing profits but not losses. The good news is the IRS allows individuals to lower their taxable income by applying these losses.

If You Sold Your Bitcoin at a Loss
Plenty of people bought bitcoin during the bull run last year. Some “bought the dip” at various points on the way back down, only to see the price slide even lower. And many discouraged investors sold their BTC at a loss along the way. For those short-term investors, there is the opportunity to claim back some of those losses.

Similarly, if an investor bought bitcoin any time between late September (the last time prices were this low) and December of 2017, it is likely they have losses for 2018 that can be used to lower their taxable income if they choose to sell now. This would lower the amount of taxes they will owe from the given year, as long as the asset isn’t bought back within 30 days (i.e. wash sale).

According to the IRS, the maximum amount by which an individual can offset their taxable income for a single year is $3,000. But, if an investor lost more than $3,000, the remaining losses can be carried over to following years up to $3,000 per year.

As an example, if an investor bought 1 BTC in late December at $17,000 and sold it at $4,000 today, they would recognize a loss of $13,000. The investor, who is assumed to have regular taxable income, can reduce their 2018 taxable income by a maximum of $3,000. The remaining unused portion of the capital loss in this situation is $10,000. The IRS allows $3,000 of that leftover $10,000 to be carried over into the next year to offset any capital gains that may be recognized at the end of 2019.

The Case for Hodling
While selling bitcoin at a loss could reduce taxable income in the short term, many proponents of bitcoin would be quick to point out that the case for holding onto the digital asset is much stronger than selling for such a marginal and temporary opportunity to save a few dollars in taxes.

There are many who believe that bitcoin will eventually become a store of value, or sound money, and that the best days of bitcoin’s price are yet to come.

However, it is unpredictable when, or even if, bitcoin will accomplish this feat. Because it is impossible to predict the short-term price movement of bitcoin, it could be argued that the case for holding for a very long time (commonly referred to as HODLing) points toward a much higher future price of bitcoin that would make selling today, for a relatively small, offsettable loss, a much greater loss in years to come.",REGULATION,-0.6472
2019/1/15,European Banking Regulators Call for Unity in Crypto Regulations,"Last week, two of the largest banking regulators within the European Union released reports calling for uniformity in the regulations of crypto assets and Initial Coin offerings (ICOs) across the continent.

The EBA Calls for Pan-EU Crypto Regulations
On January 9, 2019, the European Banking Authority (EBA) published its assessment of crypto laws. The document, which examines the sustainability of EU laws to cryptocurrencies, analyzed the use of digital assets within the EU, as well as some of the pan-EU laws that currently govern them.

In the report, the EBA decried the lack of uniformity in crypto laws. It stated that this lack of equilibrium means that companies can move operations to “crypto havens” and face less-stringent regulations.

Essentially, this could create an uneven competitive playing field. Certain countries such as Malta and Gibraltar have been known to enforce crypto-friendly rules. However, the EBA is looking to achieve a uniform regulatory environment in the zone.

Adam Farkas, executive director of the EBA, said, “The EBA calls on the European Commission to assess whether regulatory action is needed to achieve a common EU approach to crypto assets.”

The ESMA Discourages Crypto Legitimization
On the same day, the second regulator, the Europe Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) also published its advice to various EU-based banking institutions on ICOs and crypto assets.

The regulator pointed out that the crypto industry is quite small and presents little threat to traditional financial stability. However, it also expressed some concern over the risks posed to market integrity and the protection of investors.

The ESMA said, “Wider regulation of crypto-assets and related activities may have trade-offs, such as risking legitimizing crypto-assets and encouraging wider adoption.”

In addition, the report recommended that cryptocurrencies shouldn’t be legitimized, while also claiming that all digital assets should be subjected to anti-money laundering legislation.

The regulator warned about the significance of protecting the capital markets. Also, investors should be warned against buying crypto assets that aren’t financial instruments, as excess regulation could bring them “into a similar regulatory remit as the one for crypto-assets that are financial instruments.”

Gemini's Viral Ad
The sentiments of the two regulators seem to echo those of Gemini Inc., the crypto exchange owed by the Winklevoss twins.

Just last week, the company engaged in a viral, city-wide advertising campaign. Buses, taxi tops and bus stops carried signs with messages such as “Crypto Needs Rules” and “Crypto Without Chaos” being boldly displayed.

At the time, Chris Roan, head of marketing at Gemini, said, “We believe that investors coming into cryptocurrency deserve the exact same protections as investors in more traditional markets, adhering to the same standards, practices, regulations and compliance protocols.”

Also, while speaking about their ad campaign in an interview with Fortune, Tyler Winklevoss added, “The idea is that companies that build on top of things like Bitcoin should have a regulation that’s thoughtful and that doesn’t stifle innovation … People believe in the dream of crypto. They just don’t know how to engage in it without getting burned. We’re here to say Gemini’s a place you can do that.”

The Gemini ad campaign generated some to-be-expected reactions from the Bitcoin community, with many pointing out the folly in its approach to regulation.

In a tweet, Jesse Powell, CEO of Kraken, said, “Saying crypto needs rules is like saying the poor need sanctions. Here's a rule: no more rules.”

Nick Foley, a former support staffer at Coinbase, also stated that the rules required by crypto are already there — and based in mathematics. Foley took to Twitter to downplay the prospect of bringing complex regulations to the crypto space, calling most of these regulations unnecessary. Rules like mathematics? Sure. Crypto needs that. Rules like ""KYC AML licencing taxation Patriot Act bitlicense bullshit?"" No. Crypto doesn't need that.",REGULATION,0.9869
2019/1/18,Huobi Resumes Operations in Japan as a Fully Regulated Exchange,"Huobi is back in Japan, this time as a fully regulated exchange under Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA).

Following its merger with BitTrade, Huobi Japan Holding Ltd. is now among the first batch of 17 to receive registration under the FSA and is able to relaunch Huobi Japan.

Leon Li, Huobi Group founder and CEO, called the launch an “important milestone” in a statement, adding that the Japanese market remains important to the group and that working with its “regulators is a longstanding priority for Huobi Group.”

Japan's financial regulator had directed all cryptocurrency exchanges not registered as a licensed exchange with the agency to cease operations in 2017.

Huobi had left at the time, hoping to merge with SBI Virtual Currency, but that deal fell through.

Following Coincheck's hack in January 2018, the FSA had ramped up requirements for exchanges, with 160 applicants waiting in line for approval as of October 2018. Unable to get approval, Huobi acquired a majority stake in Japanese-licensed operator BitTrade, as it prepared to stage a comeback into the market.

At the moment, Huobi Japan will offer trading of bitcoin, ripple, ether, bitcoin cash, litecoin and monacoin, traded against the Japanese Yen. The exchange is also offering zero-fee transactions during the launch period.

Livio Weng, CEO of Huobi Global, told Bitcoin Magazine that Huobi Japan would draw on the expertise of the group to operate an exchange that offers better liquidity, with a strong focus on the safety and security of customer's funds.

“In addition to now offering our users a fully regulated and compliant place to trade digital assets, Huobi Japan also brings with it Huobi Group’s half-decade of experience in cryptocurrency and blockchain.”

Currently ranked as the sixth largest crypto exchange platform in the world, Huobi Group was founded in China back in 2013. The company maintained its headquarters in Singapore after the Chinese government initiated a crackdown on domestic cryptocurrency exchanges in 2017.

Huobi also operates exchanges in Canada, UAE, Australia and Brazil.",REGULATION,0.9821
2019/1/23,Elections Canada Consults With Political Parties on Crypto Donations,"According to Elections Canada, the agency that runs federal elections in Canada, there has been “a growing interest” in cryptocurrency donations. This trend has prompted some political parties to ask for a ruling on how best to manage bitcoin and other cryptocurrency political donations and how to navigate the various reporting systems required by both Elections Canada and the parties so that they comply with the Canada Elections Act.

Election season is just beginning in Canada. There are three federal by-elections called for February 25, 2019; these will fill vacant seats, including a seat for one of the party leaders. A full federal election will be called before October 21, 2019.

On the legality of accepting cryptocurrency donations, an Elections Canada (EC) official told Bitcoin Magazine that “the Canada Elections Act does not prohibit political entities from accepting cryptocurrency contributions. Political entities are therefore currently able to accept such contributions.”

Elections Canada is taking the initial position that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are non-monetary, in-kind contributions, i.e. property or a commodity, but not a currency, a similar position taken by the U.S. Federal Elections Commission (FEC) and the Canada Revenue Agency.

However, Elections Canada has left the question of whether to classify cryptocurrencies as monetary or non-monetary open for the parties to consider in the current consultation process.

Is Bitcoin Legal in Canada?
Chetan Phull, a Toronto lawyer, founder and principal of Smartblock Law Professional Corporation, has written about the seemingly murky area of the legality of using cryptocurrencies as money in Canada.

Phull told Bitcoin Magazine that the use of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as money (legal tender) is, strictly speaking, illegal under Canada’s Currency Act.

However, he acknowledges that “Canada may be opening up to treating crypto as a type of non-fiat money, despite the current statutory definition of money.”

He points out that, to date, “there has been no actual enforcement action against the use of crypto as ‘money’ in Canada — not even against the Calgary Digital Dollar, where enforcement would be supported by long-standing precedent of the Supreme Court of Canada. Nor has there been any significant government pursuit of taxes not charged on trades of crypto as a good.”

Although Elections Canada has agreed that cryptocurrencies are not money, its inquiry into crypto contributions further suggests that Canada’s general climate is warming toward the use of crypto as a type of non-fiat money.

“We’re not quite there yet given the present law on the books,” Phull stated, “but these are all signals that Canada is opening up to crypto becoming a medium exchange in commerce. The appropriate crypto-friendly legislation will follow, starting with virtual currency regulations which are presently in draft.”

Phull also noted that the trend in the U.S. to bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream, recently with a bipartisan bill before Congress for the Token Taxonomy Act, could carry some weight in Canada.

At the state level, Ohio now accepts payment of business taxes in crypto via ohiocrypto.com, three crypto-centric bills are presently in committee in New York, and a recent bill from Wyoming is attempting to clarify cryptocurrencies as money within the state.

“As more U.S. states permit the treatment of cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange, cryptocurrency in Canada will continue to move into the mainstream,” says Phull.

“Cryptocurrency will ultimately be legalized as a form of payment in Canada, one way or another. It’s just a matter of time.”

Carter Cameron-Huff, a Toronto CPA who also works as a volunteer chief financial officer for political riding associations, told Bitcoin Magazine that accepting another form of donation will require streamlined rules to meet the reporting requirements of both EC and the political party.

“The big challenge is that campaigns and riding associations need to be audited by a CPA; finding a CPA who is confident auditing things of a digital currency nature can be a challenge as they are typically risk averse.”

Political parties are responsible for ensuring that no single donor exceeds the annual limit and that complete identification is received with each donation.

Managing Cryptocurrencies as Political Donations
An official with Elections Canada told Bitcoin Magazine that their top priority is to ensure full transparency in any political donations over $20 CAD, as outlined in the Canada Elections Act.

This means that, to have a donation accepted, the political party must establish that the donor is a Canadian citizen and must confirm the identity of anyone who donates more than $20 worth of cryptocurrencies to a campaign.

Contributions of $20 CAD or less can be anonymous but EC cautions parties to “watch for unusual amounts or patterns in anonymous contributions they receive.”

In addition, each party would be required to keep a running tally of crypto donations (in equivalent fiat) to ensure that no single donor goes over the current annual donation limit of $2,700 CAD.

EC is recommending that the contribution amount is the commercial value of the cryptocurrency at the time that it was received, based on the rate on a major exchange platform.

Bitcoin Donations Not Treated Equally
Unlike a fiat contribution, donations in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies would not be eligible for a tax credit.

This is a problem for Cameron-Huff who sees this as a basic unfairness in the new EC proposal. He is planning to contribute his views as part of the Elections Canada consultations.

In the U.S., a 2014 FEC ruling that said political campaigns and organizations could accept bitcoin donations led BitPay to partner with CoinVox and a number of fundraising agencies to help process the donations.

Jared Polis, current Governor of Colorado, and Mick Mulvaney, current White House Chief of Staff, were among the first U.S. legislators to accept bitcoin campaign donations.

2019/2/1,B2C2 Gets Go-Ahead from U.K. Regulators to List Bitcoin Derivative,"B2C2, a cryptocurrency “liquidity provider” and electronic OTC trading magnate, has recently announced that British regulators have given their U.K.-based subsidiary approval to offer the crypto space a new investment derivative.

According to a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine, the British Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has authorized B2C2 OTC Inc. “to arrange and deal in Contracts for Difference (CFDs) with eligible counterparties and professional clients.” The release went on to claim that “the FCA authorisation will allow these clients of B2C2 OTC Ltd to gain exposure to cryptocurrency markets via the firm’s CFDs.”

Founder and CEO Max Boonen elaborated that they will be using this license “to introduce a cryptocurrency CFD product,” claiming that “eligible counterparties and professional clients can now gain derivative exposure to the cryptocurrency markets, benefiting from the competitive pricing and liquidity they’re accustomed to receiving from B2C2 while avoiding the risks associated with crypto custody.”

A CFD is an investment vehicle that allows investors to make contracts directly with brokers/banks, instead of relying on an open position in a market. The investor does not actually own the assets in question, but instead makes a bet on how the value of the assets will change (like with futures), thus the name “contracts for difference.” Of particular note to the crypto space is that the investor can easily bet that the value of assets will depreciate or increase, making it a convenient avenue for shorting or longing, respectively.

B2C2 calls itself “a market leader in CFDs,” earning the trust of “retail brokerages, exchanges, banks and fund managers to provide 24/7/365 liquidity,” and offering “exposure to large-cap cryptocurrencies, with flexible trade sizes and settlement.” With the ability to offer Bitcoin CFDs in the British financial system, the derivative is the newest legacy financial avenue through which bitcoin could see more institutional investor exposure.

The product’s unveiling comes on the heels of news that the Cboe, after retracting a rule-change filing last week, has resubmitted an application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to list the world’s first bitcoin exchange traded fund, a financial product that many view as Wall Street’s doorway into the crypto market.",REGULATION,0.9863
2019/2/1,Cboe Files (Again) for (Yet Another) Bitcoin ETF,"That didn’t take long.

Barely a week after the Chicago Board of Exchange (Cboe) withdrew its application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list the world’s first bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF), the exchange and its partners, VanEck and SolidX, are back at it.

Gabor Gurbacs, the director of digital asset strategy at VanEck Asset Management, broke the news on Twitter that the Cboe, on behalf of the joint initiative, had refiled for a rule change with the SEC to list the ETF. The filing has all the bureaucratic trappings of those that came before, but it will reset the clock on the SEC’s decision-making time frame for the institutional-grade product.

Since its introduction to the industry in 2013, the bitcoin ETF has been praised as the key to unlocking Wall Street’s formal access to bitcoin’s market, and, by proxy, the key to flushing fresh capital into the market to send it to new heights. A role call of rejections, delays or reviews has punctuated each effort, though, and a handful of outstanding applications (which are pending review by the commission) were, until now, the remaining contenders in Bitcoin’s multi-year wrestling match with the SEC.

This refiling has Cboe, VanEck and SolidX reentering the ring after the joint venture retracted a long-standing filing last week amidst the U.S. government’s multi-month shutdown. Jan van Eck, VanEck’s CEO, feared the obstruction might jeopardized the filings chance at approval, as regular talks with SEC personnel ceased when the shutdown took effect. Rather than take the risk that the ETF might get tossed aside, the venture opted to withdraw its proposal.

With the government now reopened, the trio is trying again (for VanEck and SolidX, this will be the fourth filing between the participants). Once the SEC lists the proposed rule change on the Federal Registry, the SEC will have 240 days to make a decision (for those of use keeping track, no later than October).

“We are actively working with regulators and major market participants to build appropriate market structure frameworks for a Bitcoin ETF and digital assets in general. I am grateful for the overwhelming support around the world,” Gabor Gurbacs told Bitcoin Magazine in a statement.",REGULATION,0.965
2019/2/15,Wyoming Passes New Friendly Regulations for Crypto Assets,"The Wyoming state government has been expanding its status as a hub for crypto and blockchain technology by passing several new bills this February.

According to Wyoming-based blockchain advocate Caitlin Long, the state of Wyoming has recently passed resolution SF0125 on February 14, 2019, claiming that Wyoming “law recognizes property rights in the direct ownership of digital assets.” The bill plainly states “that digital assets are property within the Uniform Commercial Code” and goes on to elaborate some of its ramifications.

Long gave a succinct rundown of the bill’s most salient points, stating that “In other words, you're not forced to own digital securities through an intermediary. Blockchain tech enables direct ownership of assets, and now the law does too.” Since property law in the United States is in the hands of state jurisdiction, this new step is not only safe from the federal government but also can serve as a model for other states.

“It makes perfect sense that Wyoming is the epicenter of blockchain law in the US,” said Long, a Wyoming native. “That's also why institutional investors, which are prohibited by federal law from directly owning the assets they manage, can rest assured that Wyoming's digital asset custodians are actually solvent.”

This is not the only accomplishment made by pro-crypto voices in Wyoming, however. On February 2, 2019, the Wyoming State Senate also passed a bill updating the classification of crypto assets, including a clause to formally label them as currencies.

According to the text of the bill, crypto assets can be considered to have three different statuses for legal purposes: digital consumer assets, digital securities and virtual currencies. All three of these definitions are specifically registered as personal property rather than private property, formally upholding a stance that other jurisdictions overseas and abroad have taken.

More significantly, however, the bill also further elaborates on the specific terms and conditions for each of these three statuses. In addition to the respective classifications of “general intangibles” and securities, the bill also states that “virtual currency is intangible personal property and shall be considered money.”

In redefining the legal status of crypto in this way, it formally opens up the possibility for ordinary citizens to treat crypto as an actual currency on a daily basis. This, in turn, could provide the impetus for a more comprehensive tax code or new business use cases.

Wyoming has been cultivating a reputation as a major crypto haven in the United States, in a bid to angle itself as the blockchain hub of the nation. In addition to enabling blockchain into stock certificates with bipartisan support in January 2019, Wyoming has also helped make banking laws more friendly for blockchain companies last December. Many Wyoming legislators are evidently, at the very least, sympathetic to making blockchain a new Wyoming industry and further friendliness can be expected in the future.",REGULATION,0.5994
2019/2/18,SEC to Review NYSE Arca Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Proposal,"Yet another journey to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has begun.

According to a published notice, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has begun reviewing a proposed rule change for a bitcoin ETF filed by NYSE Arca and Bitwise. The Commission now has 45 days from the date of publication to make a final decision on whether to approve, reject or extend the rule change. Should the SEC require more time to review the proposal, it can extend the review period up to 90 days, once it gives reasons for the delay.

Bitwise Asset Management and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca had announced plans to launch a physically held bitcoin ETF earlier this year.

The fund, dubbed the “Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust,” was filed with the SEC in January, along with the rule change proposal. If approved, the shares will be listed on NYSE Arca, and it would track the Bitwise Bitcoin Total Return Index, an index based on the prices of bitcoin, which it draws from a variety of cryptocurrency exchanges.

However, the rule change has only now been published in the Federal Register due to the U.S. government shutdown.

The document reads:

“Within 45 days of the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register or up to 90 days (i) as the Commission may designate if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will: (A) by order approve or disapprove the proposed rule change, or (B) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.""
The SEC has also opened up the proposal for comments from members of the general public, providing a three-week window for submitting feedback on the rule change.

So far, the SEC has shot down almost every bitcoin ETF proposal sent its way. It has rejected applications from ProShares, five ETF proposals from Direxion, Gemini and GraniteShares. Those it didn’t reject, it delayed, until submissions were subsequently withdrawn.

Most recently, VanEck and SolidX withdrew their submission with Cboe BZX Exchange, having been delayed by the SEC on multiple occasions. VanEck director of digital asset strategy Gabor Gurbacs explained that the proposal had “been temporarily withdrawn” and would be submitted at a later date, citing the government shutdown as a factor.

“We were engaged in discussions with the SEC about the bitcoin-related issues, custody, market manipulation, prices, and that had to stop. And so, instead of trying to slip through or something, we just had the application pulled and we will refile when the SEC gets going again,” VanEck CEO Jan van Eck told CNBC.",REGULATION,0.0258
2019/2/28,Blockchain Advocacy Coalition Sponsors Bill to Allow Crypto for Legal Cannabis Tax,"Activist group Blockchain Advocacy Coalition (BAC) has sponsored a bill in California’s 19th State Assembly District, set to allow legal cannabis businesses in the district to pay their state taxes using cryptocurrency. The bill was proposed by Assemblymember Phil Ting on February 20, 2019.

If put into law, it would affect California's many cannabis businesses.

Logistical Barriers: Delivering Bags of Cash
One of the most prominent driving factors behind this bill, and where the decentralized nature of financial blockchain technology really has a chance to shine, is the fact that banks lack cooperation with these businesses. Citing a conflict with federal law, many financial institutions refuse to let cannabis businesses open bank accounts, thereby cutting off this multibillion-dollar industry from using digital money transfers.

“The current recommendation from the state of California to cannabis businesses is that they use armored vehicles to pay their taxes,” said Alexandra Medina of the BAC. “That’s inefficient and risky. It’s closer to how one might pay taxes during the gold rush, with a stage coach and gunman, than how you would expect California to accept taxes in 2019.”

This current approach is a logistical “nightmare for cities, the state and businesses,” she claimed. It’s dangerous to money couriers, and it forces revenue agencies “to count tens of thousands of bills,” causing tax offices to “smell like weed and fabric softener.”

So far, there has been little progress made to alleviate the situation. “The previous state treasurer convened a working group to solve this issue, and a year later their report did not have a solution,” said Medina. The physical cash transport is “a problem the state has tried and failed to solve.”

Opportunities for Blockchain and Open Finance
Medina called the new bill “a great use case for blockchain and open finance.” To this end, the Blockchain Advocacy Coalition will help educate policymakers about the basics of digital currency and blockchain technology in the hopes of getting the bill passed.

The group has already hosted roundtables for the state’s new treasurer, Fiona Ma, and Governor Gavin Newsom. “They are both very tech savvy and innovative leaders for our state,” said Medina. “Now is a really good time to introduce something like this.”

In the grander scheme, Medina believes that “California has the opportunity to turn around a lack of regulatory clarity” and serve as an example for other states in the Union.

Getting the Bill Passed
At present, getting the bill passed is the group’s main concern. The bill recommends using a stablecoin for these tax payments, but in its current form it will not be prescribing a specific stablecoin. For now, according to Medina, the bill’s supporters will “work to create standards for what kind of coins and wallets the state uses to make sure we have the highest degree of stability and safety for both the state and businesses.”

Medina claimed that the group has already supported two bills that were signed into law in the last year. This new bill will start going through the assembly committee(s) in March and April and has until the end of May to pass the Assembly. Then it will repeat the process with the Senate; it has to get through committee and through the Senate floor by September 13, 2019. If all of these processes go smoothly, and the governor signs it into law by October 13, 2019, Medina expects the bill to be implemented by June 2020.

Medina said that in the BAC’s previous campaigns, over 50 businesses signed support letters for their initiatives, and the group “would like an even stronger showing this year.”

She added that the group has plans to organize “a blockchain education day, where industry advocates can meet with legislators 1:1 and answer questions about the technology and bill,” before the vote reaches the Senate.",REGULATION,0.34
2019/3/8,Canadian Federal Tax Agency Targets Bitcoin Investors,"The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has apparently been specifically targeting bitcoin and crypto investors as part of its broader tax strategy to keep tabs on their cryptocurrency investments, including how they purchase these assets.

Forbes reported on this story in early March, detailing some of the tactics of the CRA, which include audits and questionnaires. In addition to subjecting cryptocurrency investors to audits, many of these same users have also been sent “comprehensive questionnaires to fill out regarding their bitcoin-related activity over the past years.” Reportedly, some sixty audits are actively ongoing.

These questionnaires have notably included in-depth sections inquiring into various services to obscure a user’s identity or transaction history. Known as mixing services, protocols such as CoinJoin increases a person’s privacy by allowing them to combine their transactions with several other users, putting several layers of obfuscation between a sender and receiver. When transactions are processed using tumblers and mixers like this, it becomes nearly impossible to tell who exactly sent or received what.

Audited users were also asked several in-depth questions about their ability to purchase bitcoin and other crypto assets anonymously, directly referencing services such as Changely and ShapeShift. Notably, ShapeShift implemented KYC account registration at the end of 2018, no longer making it an anonymous exchange.

Other anonymous services to exchange bitcoin include LocalBitcoins, utilizing non-custodial transactions. Some users leverage LocalBitcoins to buy crypto off the grid, settling trades using hard cash and organizing them off the site (these users will enter a trade on the site but use off-site methods of communication to settle it). When hard cash is used in this way, so long as the buyer and seller don’t log the trade on the website, there is no record of the buyer owning said crypto assets.

Incredibly, the survey also asks users “to list all personal crypto asset addresses that are not associated with their custodial wallet accounts.”

The CRA’s interest in such services seems to be related to their potential for avoiding government scrutiny. The CRA’s Project Oversight Director Jared Adams suggested on Twitter that these services could be used for money laundering. According to Forbes, the CRA has been running a dedicated cryptocurrency unit since 2017, with its goals ranging from the auditing of users to a general gathering of information on the crypto asset space.

According to the CRA’s statements, the agency is “committed to helping taxpayers understand their tax obligations when using digital currencies, and to remind them that using digital currency does not exempt consumers from their tax obligations.” It went on to state that the audits are only aimed at “highest risk files,” and that they hope to “[promote] a fair tax system for all Canadians.”

This attitude is exemplary of a recurring problem between cryptocurrencies and government agencies. The anonymity included in the technology by design makes it particularly difficult for tax agencies to collect accurate records on digital currencies, and this can cause friction in the space. Cryptocurrency research firm CoinCenter, for example, believes that the U.S.’s tax system for crypto is “broken” and that it shows a fundamental lack of understanding for how these assets function.",REGULATION,0.8851
2019/3/11,Proposed Texas Bill Would Require ID Verification for Crypto Use,"A bill proposed by the Texas legislature will require that all receivers of cryptocurrency in regular transactions verify the identity of the cryptocurrency sender before accepting any payment. If passed, the measure will go into effect on September 1, 2019.

In its current form, the text of the bill itself is brief, providing very few clues as to how such an ambitious task will be carried out. Apart from definitions of basic terms, the bill’s most concrete requirement is that “before accepting payment by a digital currency, a person must verify the identity of the person sending payment,” with an exception to be made if both parties are already using “digital currency that allows the true identities of the sender and the receiver to be known before a person has access to another person’s digital wallet.”

The bill also lays some vital groundwork for developing the tools to eventually carry out this plan. It indicates that, if passed, it would have “the Texas Department of Banking, Credit Union Commission, Texas Department of Public Safety, and State Securities Board” collaborate to develop the identification tools, and in cooperateion with law enforcement agencies.

Regulators in several countries have had an ongoing struggle to reckon with this technology and integrate it into their financial regulations and legal systems. This Texas bill, for instance, could be incredibly difficult to enforce, even with the cooperation of several regulatory agencies, given the censorship-resistance of cryptocurrency transactions.

Instead of trying to police the development of cryptocurrency, other states have attempted to accommodate cryptocurrency into their state’s financial business laws. On multiple occasions, Wyoming, for example, has shown a willingness to become a regional hub for crypto-asset businesses. In February, the state’s legislature enacted two cryptocurrency laws, one that allows individuals and businesses to directly own crypto-assets without needing an intermediary for custody, and one that deems that “virtual currency is intangible personal property and shall be considered money.”

As a somewhat incredible cross-party cooperation in these politically fractious times, many crypto-friendly initiatives in Wyoming received bipartisan support, with bills being proposed jointly by representatives from both major parties.",REGULATION,0.9736
2019/3/13,CipherTrace Partners with Maltese Regulators to Manage Risk of Financial Crimes,"CipherTrace Partners with Maltese Regulators to Manage Risk of Financial Crimes
CipherTrace, a blockchain analytics company, is partnering with the Republic of Malta’s sole financial regulatory agency to ensure that all crypto transactions within the country are free of money laundering and other similar financial crimes.

As the Times of Malta reported on March 11, 2019, the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) has enlisted the help of U.S.-based company CipherTrace to audit cryptoasset services that operate within Malta’s jurisdiction.

The MFSA will require potential cryptocurrency agents, like individuals operating exchanges, wallets and ICOs, to formally register with the MFSA. CipherTrace will then “provide the MFSA with powerful oversight tools to automate regulatory processes and audit the risk management of virtual asset businesses licensed in Malta,” claimed CEO Joseph Cuschieri.

Blockchain analytics companies, which have proliferated in the bear market, have come under public scrutiny as of late for their stated goal of deanonymizing blockchain transactions and the privacy implications that this presents. One such company, Chainalysis, made a public statement of their privacy policies in early March to try and pre-empt some of these criticisms.

Malta sits at an interesting crossroads in this particular issue as a result of this. Attempting to position itself as a blockchain hub for quite some time, the government has passed laws to attract crypto businesses, and has met with a degree of success. With these moves, however, the risk of financial crimes has increased. As such, the Times of Malta reported that the timeline for Malta’s approval of crypto licenses “[depends] on the due diligence assessment — including competence in the field of anti-money laundering and the counter funding of terrorism.” CipherTrace, it seems, is the latest of several blockchain companies to earn the Maltese government’s confidence. Using its tools, the MFSA could keep tabs on a number of financial crimes.",REGULATION,-0.2732
2019/3/14,"MIT Bitcoin: Legislators Discuss Regulation, Potential of Blockchain Tech","On March 9–10, 2019, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology hosted a two-day event, the MIT Bitcoin Expo 2019. Put together by the student-organized MIT Bitcoin Club, the conference welcomed more than just Bitcoin voices from every corner of the industry. One of those voices was that of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce.

Peirce sat down with Gary Gensler, ex-chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, senior lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management and senior advisor to the director of the MIT Media Lab, to discuss the progress of the SEC’s efforts to regulate the cryptocurrency industry. Notably, Gensler and Peirce launched into a discussion on what regulators can do better to protect investors from fraud and malicious actors.

Before the debate began, both Gensler and Peirce expressed their appreciation for the emerging technology. “It’s a new way to have tamper resistant data amongst the consensus of multiple parties,” Gensler said. “My research is mostly around the business of blockchain technology and … trying to find where are the real use cases where traditional data structures don’t work as well.”

Peirce expressed her own support for the space in relation to the SEC’s ongoing efforts to properly regulate it. “We have rules on the books that we have to enforce, but on the other hand, we don’t want to stop people from doing things that are going to make society a better place to live, that are going to make people’s lives easier, and enable people to interact in ways that they have not been able to in the past.”

Later in the presentation, the two veteran regulators went on to discuss what the government can do to protect investors by possibly regulatinged cryptocurrency exchanges.

Gensler believes that “exchanges are the gateway to get good public policy, particularly around AML laws, but also around investor protection.” He continued, “In essence, that there’s not a manipulated market with frontrunning and manipulation with the order books and the like.”

The discourse was ongoing, and the most significant takeaway was that regulators like Peirce and the SEC acknowledge that, again, perhaps the current system of rules don’t apply perfectly. How could securities-based regulations be placed on all cryptocurrencies, even those that are officially defined as not securities?

The SEC, according to Peirce, is working on what may be an alternative set of rules for exchanges that do not violate the rules of listing unregistered securities. Bitcoin, which is not a security, falls neatly into this alternative rule set. And, though it is currently unclear what the exact precedents will be, Peirce’s thoughts around the subject at MIT’s latest Bitcoin Expo were nothing short of encouraging for Bitcoin’s regulatory future.

“People regulate each other in their interactions with one another, and that’s sort of the whole purpose of the Bitcoin idea … that it would be this community that would be able to regulate itself. So as problems arise, people in the community are thinking about how to deal with those problems.

“I think these markets could regulate themselves if we lived in a world that allowed that,” Peirce added.

Peirce has made similar remarks about the SEC’s awareness of the Bitcoin community’s tendency to self-regulate in the past.

Gensler and Peirce also discussed the topic of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and what is being done to provide clarity to people participating in the once-booming phase. Peirce went on to explain that the SEC has already provided some clarity for investors who want to create a company, raise funds from investors and then distribute returns based on the company’s performance. For these individuals, the existing securities rules will apply to their tokens.

There are, however, the countless number of tokens that claim to be used as a utility on the network they belong to, but originate through an ICO in which they accept funds from investors in exchange for these tokens. There are still a plethora of unanswered questions around these.

“That’s where we need to do a better job,” Peirce said, “in providing guidance in how does it change from one thing to another.” Eventually, she said, the SEC wants to remove the big gray cloud hanging over these project’s heads.

Overall, the uplifting theme of the entire discussion could be summarized by an exchange between Peirce and a member of the audience, addressing the current system that discourages equal opportunity in retail participation.

The audience member asked, “It may be hubristic, but many of us are not independently wealthy and we still believe we can make good investment decisions, and right now we’re excluded from participating. How can we move the accredited investor laws away from wealth thresholds and toward something that’s far more reasonable and accessible to mainstream investors?”

“Our accredited investors rules … I personally think those rules are not consistent with what this country is about,” Peirce admitted, “which is about people taking opportunities, taking their talents and intelligence and applying it to make their lives better. We’ve put this artificial barrier in place so that people can’t do that.”

As far as whether or not these opinions will translate into legislature, time will tell. The entire MIT Bitcoin Expo 2019 livestream recording can be viewed here.",REGULATION,0.9965
2019/3/19,Israeli Court Rules Against One-Size-Fits-All Bitcoin Ban by Bank,"An Israeli court ruled on March 17, 2019, that banks can't enforce a blanket ban against all accounts linked to cryptocurrency. Instead, the court said, banks need to consider the specific type and scope of crypto-related activity before determining whether or not to open an account.

The case involved a lawsuit begun in May 2018 by Israminers, a bitcoin mining company based in Ukraine, against the Union Bank of Israel. The bank refused to accept deposits into the company's account, and ultimately shut the account down because much of the money in the account was related to bitcoin.

The bank's position was that allowing crypto-related activity within accounts that it managed put it at risk of facilitating money laundering. As a result, it decided as early as 2014 to refuse to provide services related to virtual currencies.

The bank argued in court that it had notified the Supervisor of Banks, the Israeli government agency that oversees the banking industry, of its policy and was not told that it would pose a problem.

However, in a March 17, 2019, ruling, judge Limor Bibi wrote that the bank's policy was too broad, according to the Israeli newspaper Calcalist. It is ""unreasonable,"" he wrote, for banks to adopt a ""sweeping policy"" under which they ban all activity related to bitcoin or other cryptocurrency.

That said, Bibi also wrote that banks are within their rights to refuse to provide services for customers operating in the crypto economy if a bank has a legitimate reason to believe that the customers might be seeking to launder money.

In short, then, the court upheld the right of banks to refuse to provide services for crypto-related activities if they might violate the law. But banks can't ban deposits or accounts simply because they involve crypto.

Broadly speaking, the ruling aligns with the recommendations released earlier this month by Israel's financial regulator regarding the crypto economy. The report encourages the government to support crypto companies while emphasizing the importance of disclosures and oversight of crypto activity.",REGULATION,-0.5574
2019/3/19,After QuadrigaCX: New Regulations for Canadian Exchanges Are in the Works,"As anxiety grows around every new twist and turn in the ongoing QuadrigaCX drama, along with extensive QuadrigaCX media coverage, Canada’s mainstream media has been calling on the government to bring in better oversight and regulation of cryptocurrency businesses, especially cryptocurrency exchanges.

In response to these calls for more regulation and calls from some crypto businesses for more regulatory clarity, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) and the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) released a discussion paper on March 14, 2019, with a “New Proposed Platform Framework” that would aim to specifically tailor regulations to the special risks posed by cryptocurrency exchanges.

The CSA consultation paper, which can be viewed here, asks 22 questions and requests comments from crypto/fintech companies, market participants/investors and other crypto stakeholders about what regulations would best fit in the unique new cryptocurrency marketplace.

When Is a Crypto Exchange a Securities or Derivatives Dealer?
As a number of observers have commented, this round of consultations is mainly about how to define the new business of cryptocurrency exchanges and how far to go in imposing old regulatory models on a new economic system.

Calgary-based securities and cryptocurrency lawyer Matt Burgoyne commented on Twitter:

“There is a lot to unpack in the new CSA consultation paper on cryptocurrency exchanges. Exchanges must consider whether their interactions with users create a derivative contract or futures contract.”

He added, “Non-security tokens trading on Canadian exchanges may be derivatives and still subject to regulation … this is a really detailed set of consultation questions, comments from industry due May 15.”

Lawyer Evan Thomas, who headed up a legal team at Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP to produce a summary of the CSA consultation paper, told Bitcoin Magazine:

“A big issue with this proposal is that it is not clear as a legal matter that Canadian securities regulators have jurisdiction to regulate platforms for trading bitcoin and other crypto-assets that are not securities.”

One of the goals stated in the Osler paper is:

“To ensure that the CSA does not exceed its jurisdiction over the cryptoasset industry, we are hopeful that Platform regulation will provide further clarity regarding types of cryptoassets and related services that are not subject to securities regulation, such as tokens that are not investment contracts or derivatives and non-custodial cryptocurrency wallets.”

Third Time Lucky?
The Canadian government has conducted two previous consultation rounds with the cryptocurrency industry (in 2014 and 2018) but Thomas, who is cautiously optimistic, notes that this new initiative is a more direct response to cases like that of QuadrigaCX.

“Earlier regulation was directed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. This proposed framework is motivated by investor protection concerns; that is, trying to protect crypto users who use custodial exchanges from risks like hacking, embezzlement and market manipulation,” Thomas explained.

The ghost of QuadrigaCX can be seen in the current discussion paper which asks: What operational requirements should be put in place to prevent a collapse like that of QuadrigaCX? What measures can affect market integrity, fair pricing, disclosure of conflict of interest and business continuity planning?

Would the Proposed Regulations Have Prevented the QuadrigaCX Collapse?
It’s an interesting question whether the proposed regulations in the discussion paper would have prevented what happened at QuadrigaCX — and the answer is likely no.

Amber D. Scott, CEO of Outlier Canada, a cryptocurrency compliance consulting company, told Bitcoin Magazine that without adequate enforcement resources, it’s unlikely the new rules would have affected the outcome.

“Background checks for beneficial owners and executives are useful if they are sufficiently in-depth and acted upon. The QuadrigaCX story is interesting because they were registered with FINTRAC (Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada) at one point (though it's not clear whether they were up front in their application about the beneficial owners).

“Similarly, proposed audits are useful tools, but I expect that fooling auditors would be possible, especially given that there will be very few experienced auditors that also understand crypto assets at this stage.”

She added that, in many cases, the impact is likely to be a greater cost of compliance burden for companies that choose to operate within these frameworks, and very little for those that do not. “In my estimation, some of the most important (and lacking) resources are those needed to investigate and prosecute bad actors. Fraud is already illegal.”

Clear Regulations Are Good for Crypto Business
Despite this, a number of Canadian crypto exchanges, including Coinsquare and Coinberry, have said they would welcome clear, fair regulations that make it easier to be compliant and will help bring them into the financial mainstream.

The Osler paper highlights the positive benefits of regulation including better relationships with the banking sector:

“By establishing a regulatory regime for Platforms, the Framework may make it easier for Platforms to obtain and maintain commercial relationships with banks and other financial institutions, which remains an ongoing challenge for certain Platforms.”

In addition, clear regulations that apply to crypto asset securities dealers would be an opening for businesses that are currently flying under the radar.

“The Framework potentially opens the door for Platforms that transact in cryptoassets that are securities or derivatives to operate within Canada in a compliant manner. Examples may include Platforms dealing in security tokens or tokenized assets, decentralized prediction markets or other so-called ‘decentralized finance’ (DeFi) activities.”

The proposed regulations will apply to crypto platforms located in Canada, as well as foreign platforms with Canadian participants, which might be eligible for exemptions if they are appropriately regulated in their home jurisdiction.

2019/3/20,Japan Introduces Stricter Regulation for Crypto Margin Trading,"Japanese regulators have reportedly approved draft amendments to the country's financial instruments and payment services laws, introducing stricter regulations for margin trading of digital assets.

A report by local news publication Nikkei Asia Review noted that the amendments will place a cap on available leverage for crypto margin trading, pegging it at two to four times the initial deposit.

The report, published yesterday, also claimed that all cryptocurrency exchanges that offer margin trading will have to register with Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) within 18 months of the new rules being implemented in April 2020.

Clamping Down on Margin Trading
Margin trading is the use of borrowed funds (often obtained from a financial broker or an exchange) to trade a financial asset. The funds borrowed become collateral for the loan, upon which interest is paid.

The practice of margin trading for cryptocurrencies has become popular in recent years thanks to its potential for significant returns. Platforms such as BitMEX have offered massive leverage on margin trading, increasing their appeal to investors globally. But the potential high yield from such investments can also come with downsides, including the temptation to make large, risky investments with borrowed funds.

Protecting Consumers in a Growing Market
According to the report, the new rules will allow Japan to more closely monitor exchanges in a concerted effort to better protect consumers. Exchanges that offer margin trading and those that issue tokens through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) would be separated and regulated differently, for instance. The hope is that this categorization will enable the FSA to clamp down on scam investment opportunities, while also providing a healthy environment for the crypto industry to continue its growth.

For some time now, Japan’s reputation as a crypto haven has been growing, thanks to its seemingly progressive stance on digital currencies.

In October 2018, the FSA approved the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA), a self-regulatory body that consists of 16 licensed crypto exchange platforms in the country. The group was given the authority to create regulatory guidelines for implementing industry-wide security standards and preventing insider trading.

Prior to the regulator's approval, the association had proposed a ban on privacy-centric tokens like Monero on crypto exchanges. It also mulled over the idea of holding government bonds to insure cryptocurrencies.",REGULATION,0.9899
2019/3/22,"Mexico’s Proposed Crypto Laws Create New Barriers For Exchanges, Adoption","Earlier this month, the Bank of Mexico (Banxico) published a circular, wherein it laid out its plan to issue permits to bitcoin exchange platforms and other crypto-related businesses operating in the country.

Banxico’s circular stated that to get the right permits, crypto-based businesses in the country would be required to provide detailed business plans and company profiles.

Each profile will have to contain various aspects of how the business operates including its business model, transaction fees and know-your-customer (KYC) security measures.

Per the circular, the principal objective of the regulator is to curb the occurrence of crypto-based money laundering. To achieve this, it has implemented certain safeguards that will keep the operations of crypto businesses away from the traditional financial sector.

A report by local news outlet El Siglo de Torreón clarified that any business looking to submit their application for a permit online will need to do so with a digital certificate, which helps provide confidentiality.

For those who don’t have these certificates, the filing will have to be mailed to the Gerencia de Operación y Continuidad de Negocio de los Sistemas de Pagos, Banxico’s payment systems division.

Application for this permit has been open since September 2018, although companies might now have to wait until March 2020 before the new law will come into effect.

A Regulatory Roadblock
The central bank has also prohibited any regulated financial institution from transacting with crypto-related businesses.

In an op-ed published by advocacy group Coin Center, written by Executive Director Jerry Brito and Research Director Peter Van Valkenburgh, the authors noted that the actions of Banxico are draconian, effectively putting the local crypto market to the sword.

The post states:

“Cryptocurrency exchanges dealing in fiat currency need access to the local banking system. Under the new law, that access will be severely impeded. While the central bank can claim that they are not ‘banning’ exchanges, the effect will be the same.”

The authors of the post also attacked the central bank for taking advantage of a recently passed fintech legislation to crack down on crypto exchanges in Mexico.

“As originally envisioned, the new fintech law should have opened Mexico for innovation by not only allowing cryptocurrency exchanges to continue operating but also to provide them a reasonable path to better regulation as full-fledged financial institutions. The central bank, however, has now proposed to do the opposite, closing the door on these promising new technologies by prohibiting any regulated financial institution from offering cryptocurrency exchange, transmission, or custody services to customers.”

Some of the arguments offered by Banxico for its proposed law include the volatility and complexity of cryptocurrencies, as well as their propensity to be used for illegal purposes.

However, Brito and Van Valkenburgh faulted the premise, claiming that those same properties are inherent in concepts like the internet and cars. Still, that hasn’t stopped people from using them.

They concluded the op-ed by calling for support as they look to fight against the regulations, which have now officially entered a consideration period.

It is clear why Banxico would resort to establishing regulatory measures on its native crypto market. While the crypto industry shows potential for ushering in a radical change to the way that transactions are conducted worldwide, there has also been a global awakening to the risks that these assets have to investors and traders.

Other jurisdictions, like Japan, have made similar moves, with the sole purpose of establishing a regulatory framework for crypto-based firms to operate and thrive.

Limiting the Growth of Crypto
However, according to a report from Mexican news outlet El Economista, the reforms proposed by Banxico could end up destroying the growth prospects of the Mexican crypto market, while creating further division between the country’s crypto industry and its traditional financial sector.

The piece argued that, should Banxico get its way, the reforms would “limit the use of cryptocurrencies to internal use only for banks and regulated FinTech companies,” leaving crypto-based firms with no option but to operate outside of the law’s scope.

The outlet quoted Rocio Robles, managing director at the National Banking and Securities Commission, who explained that the new laws could make various trading operations much more difficult. Robles pointed out that while the rules won’t necessarily halt the growth of the country’s crypto industry, its implementation would create many obstacles to its development.

He said that with these laws in place, digital assets “could continue to make progress in Mexico, but they will involve a lot more hard work.”",REGULATION,0.2732
2019/3/28,Innisfil Becomes First City in Canada to Accept Bitcoin for Municipal Taxes,"Ohio might have made history as the first state to accept cryptocurrency for corporate taxes, but one Canadian town is adding its name to the books by becoming the first in North America to permit its citizens to pay their personal taxes in bitcoin.

The tiny town of Innisfil (with a population of 36,500), situated about 45 minutes north of Toronto, just approved an initiative that will allow its residents to satisfy their municipal taxes (income taxes and property taxes) in bitcoin, beginning in April 2019.

Andrei Poliakov, the founder and CEO of Coinberry, told Bitcoin Magazine that the exchange has been in talks with officials for some months, after Kyle Kemper of the Blockchain Association of Canada connected the private and public entities. A live hearing was held on March 27, 2019, to pass the initiative and it went off without a hitch, Poliakov said.

“The staff, councils and mayor of the town of Innisfil are extremely forward thinking and innovative,” Poliakov enthused. ""Coinberry approached the town with a proposal to start accepting property taxes in cryptocurrency and, after several months of discussions, we were able to make Bitcoin history in Canada yesterday!”

Coinberry is poised to play an integral role for Innisfil residents who utilize the new option.

“Payments will be processed through Coinberry Pay, a cryptocurrency payment processing solution developed by Coinberry for use by municipalities, charities, merchants and individuals looking to accept payments, donations or tips in cryptocurrency,” Poliakov said.

The payment solution is hosted by Coinberry but taxpayers will have to go through a government website to pay their taxes. Once a payment is processed through Coinberry, the exchange will convert it to Canadian dollars and then pass it on to Innisfil's municipal government.

Poliakov told Bitcoin Magazine that the trend has a chance to catch on with neighboring towns as well, and his hopes are to eventually encourage the city council of Toronto to adopt the option. But he and other proponents won't truly be satisfied until the Bitcoin bug bites every layer of Canada's political system — all the way up to the federal level.

“The goal with Coinberry Pay in general, and with the current initiative specifically, is to bring about the mass adoption of cryptocurrency as a method of payment in Canada,” said Poliakov. “We are in discussion with a number of parties both within government and the private sector to utilize our solution. Our goal at Coinberry is to make crypto simple — we will continue to expand our cryptocurrency payment processing service to municipalities and other government agencies in the near future. We truly believe in the benefits of mass adoption of cryptocurrency and are working very hard to make that a reality.”

To start, bitcoin will be the only available cryptocurrency option for citizens to break the fiat tax barrier, but Poliakov said that Coinberry Pay will be adding ether, litecoin, ripple and bitcoin cash soon, as well.

The initiative is a significant win for both Canadian citizens and the cryptocurrency industry and, given that an exchange spearheaded the initiative, it’s likely restored some community trust in the industry following the ongoing QuadrigaCX debacle. With a municipal government choosing to place its trust in both Coinberry and bitcoin, the industry and its flagship asset is one step closer to achieving greater understanding and de-stigmatization with the populace at large.

“Once again, we are proud to be first in taking this bold step by offering this new, exciting payment option to our residents,” Innisfil Mayor Lynn Dollin said in a press release. “There’s no doubt that cryptocurrency is growing in usage and popularity. By getting into this now, we are making sure our municipality is ahead of the game, and signalling to the world that we truly are a future-ready and innovative community.”",REGULATION,0.3818
2019/3/28,"LocalBitcoins, Once a Go-To for Anonymous Bitcoin Transactions, Adds KYC","The Finland-based, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading platform LocalBitcoins released a statement on March 25, 2019, responding to a new act approved by the Finnish Parliament that will require users to verify their identities. This marks a major change for the service, which had been a primary way for users wishing to protect their anonymity to meet others willing to buy or sell bitcoin in person without sharing details about their identities.

The Act on Virtual Currency Service Providers was passed alongside an amendment to the country’s existing Act on Detecting and Preventing Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing, also known as its anti-money laundering (AML) law. Together, these regulations will bring cryptocurrency services like LocalBitcoins under the AML law and the supervision of the country’s Financial Supervisory Authority.

LocalBitcoins Introduces Changes
The changes will come into effect in November, and per the post, LocalBitcoins has framed the new regulations as an advantage for the long-term viability and acceptance of Bitcoin.

“The Virtual Currency Service Providers Act will come into full effect in the beginning of November 2019 creating a legal status for crypto assets, which should improve significantly Bitcoin’s standing as a viable and legit financial network,” according to the statement. “We have launched a new account registration process where users can verify basic information already during sign-up, making it easier for the newcomer to find trading partners … and increasing the number of suitable customers to advertisers as well as inhibiting the creation of illegitimate accounts.”

The company also said that it was improving its verification systems at users’ requests. This will include four individual account levels per trade and BTC volume, as well as a separate verification process for corporate accounts.

“In certain situations we may require enhanced identity verification,” the company’s updated terms of service states. “This may include requirements to verify details or sources of funds regarding payments you have made or received during trades on LocalBitcoins as well as bitcoin transactions that you’ve sent or received from your LocalBitcoins account.”

Prior to the inclusion of know-your-customer (KYC) measures on LocalBitcoins, new users could register an account and start trading in less than 10 seconds. Now, they apparently have to enter their personal information as it appears on their bank account, along with their country of residence and phone number, which LocalBitcoins will verify. Once all of this personal information is provided, users are granted access to the site and can find people in their area interested in buying or selling bitcoin.

Finland’s Finance Ministry Cracks Down on Cryptocurrencies
The discussion around cryptocurrency regulation has been underway in Finland for quite some time, with Yle reporting in January 2018 that the country wanted to introduce “rules that seek to prevent money laundering and organised crime activities.”

The Ministry’s legislative advisor, Armi Taipale, said that meeting this goal would require banks and insurance companies to declare all of their cryptocurrency handlings.

“In other words, virtual currencies such as bitcoin now allow customers to remain anonymous, so the idea is to bring things out into the open,” she said, per the report.

2019/4/1,Pakistan Introduces Crypto Regulation,"The Pakistani government will now regulate local cryptocurrency firms under new legislation. Local news outlet The Express Tribune reported that the government of Pakistan will introduce Electronic Money Institutions (EMI) regulations based on the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

The FATF is an intergovernmental organization based in France that creates policies for combating money laundering and other threats to the integrity of the global financial system. It has reportedly been working on international regulations for cryptocurrencies.

The Express Tribune report cited anonymous sources from within the country’s finance ministry, stating that the measures were instituted in line with a government objective to effectively monitor the use of digital currencies within the country and curb illicit activity.

“These regulations will help [in] combating money laundering and terrorism financing while [they] will also help regulation of digital currency throughout the country,” the sources said, per the report.

The FATF has warned international regulators about the potential for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin to be used for illicit activities.

Pakistan’s new framework has yet to be released publicly, and specific requirements will need to be met before the country’s central bank, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), can ratify them.

According to the SBP’s draft regulations for EMIs, released in October 2018, crypto companies will be mandated to meet specific capital requirements, carry out due diligence regarding their customers (including storing their personal and residential information) and take predetermined steps to ensure the safety of their customers’ funds. Operating licenses will be suspended or revoked if and when local crypto firms refuse to abide by the rules.

The Pakistani government has tried to adopt a tough stance of crypto assets in the past. In April of last year, the SBP issued a warning via Twitter that it oversees all domestic and international payment and transfer services taking place in the country. It linked to a report titled “Caution Regarding Risks of Virtual Currencies.”

The new regulations will be unveiled formally in a ceremony at the State Bank of Pakistan’s Islamabad office. Notable expected attendees at the ceremony include SBP Governor Tariq Bajwa and Federal Minister of Finance Asad Umar.",REGULATION,0.3612
2019/4/2,"Paxful Introduces AI-Powered, Biometric Verification to Improve KYC and AML","The peer-to-peer bitcoin marketplace Paxful announced today, April 2, 2019, that it’s introducing AI-powered identity verification to help improve know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) procedures on the platform.

Teaming up with Jumio, a digital identity and address verification company, Paxful is hoping that this added verification will help to minimize fraud risk.

Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Ray Youssef, co-founder and CEO of Paxful, said that the platform was already emphasizing account verification as a way to prevent fraud.

“Prior to implementing Jumio, we had a zero-tolerance system for scammers, fraud and any other illicit financial crime,” Youssef explained. “We required all customers to verify their accounts through email and phone verification [and] we encouraged them to use two-factor authentication for added protection to their account.”

But with the aid of Jumio, the platform will be capable of improving its KYC and AML procedures and compliance program in every operating country through a biometric facial recognition feature provided by Jumio.

According to Youssef, this was the feature his team desired most to help combat fraud because it’s not only effective in protecting their users but was also the “least complicated for our customers to implement.”

Through the AI-powered identity service and end-to-end verification process, Paxful will verify users’ identities with an ID scan, biometric authentication and liveness detection. This latter feature prevents someone from simply using a static image or prerecorded video to fake an identity.

Users who reach an equivalent of $1,500 in trade volume or wallet activity on Paxful will be required to verify their accounts through ID verification. Users who reach $10,000 in trade volume or wallet activity will also be asked to verify their addresses.

It was also important to Paxful that this advanced ID verification did not require the use of a smartphone.

“They can just as easily use a web camera as well,” Youssef said. “Given that we have a large customer base in emerging markets, this was a key benefactor in going with Jumio. They make it easy for our customers, no matter where they are, to provide ID and address verification.”

The introduction of AI-powered ID verification comes at a time when Paxful has seen a steady rise in the number of users trading bitcoin on the platform. In 2018, for instance, Paxful saw an increase in volume of around 125 percent, Youssef said, crediting the surge with an emergence of cryptocurrency trades in Africa.

“Africa is our top market and has reached an average of 17,000 trades per day,” he explained. “Many Africans are used to KYC. For example, in Nigeria you must KYC with a fingerprint scan to get a SIM card for your phone. Africans have been preyed upon and exposed to great fraud risk so they welcome KYC if it will guarantee a safe and open system.”",REGULATION,0.8415
2019/4/3,In Plain English: SEC Publishes Guidance on Tokens as Securities,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has published an investment contract framework for digital assets, which is intended to give crypto companies guidance as to whether a cryptocurrency is a security. It’s the first major culminating work of the SEC’s FinHub initiative, a strategic group the commission launched in October 2018 to liaise with fintech and cryptocurrency companies and work toward more substantial regulatory guidance.

This concrete framework comes after years of guidance by enforcement, wherein the SEC prosecuted ICO operators and token companies after their token sales to make examples of the more egregious and unscrupulous opportunists who took advantage of the 2016-2017 bull run.

With the new 13-page framework, cryptocurrency companies will now have a clear touchstone for testing whether or not the SEC would qualify an asset that they offer as a security. But, like SEC enforcement that has targeted ICO orchestrators and broker/dealers in the past, the guidance is not confined to token projects alone — it’s also applicable to crypto exchanges, custody organizations, hedge funds, marketing firms and “other professional services.”

“As financial technologies, methods of capital formation, and market structures continue to evolve, market participants should be aware that they may be conducting activities that fall within our jurisdiction,” according to an SEC press release on the new report. “The framework is not intended to be an exhaustive overview of the law, but rather, an analytical tool to help market participants assess whether the federal securities laws apply to the offer, sale, or resale of a particular digital asset.”

The Thick of It
So when will a cryptocurrency offering be considered a security?

The document kicks off with reference to the Howey Test, a litmus test for what defines an investment contract that was established by a 1946 Supreme Court decision. Notably, the test looks not only at the asset being offered or sold but how it is offered or sold. This implies most saliently to ICOs, as the SEC has been keen to remind investors and entrepreneurs for years now, including its insistence that simply calling something a “utility token” doesn’t exculpate it from a security status.

“Under the Howey test, an ‘investment contract’ exists when there is the investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others,” according to the guidance. “Whether a particular digital asset at the time of its offer or sale satisfies the Howey test depends on the specific facts and circumstances.”

The document then goes on to identify the three primary conditions that constitute an investment contract, namely: that money/value is invested (whether as fiat or crypto), that a “common enterprise” is present (i.e., that some central entity offers the contract and shares a common interest with its purchasers) and that there’s an expectation of profit or return.

As the first two are pretty cut and dry (and the document states that, in its experience, the SEC believes most token sales satisfy these two criteria), the framework unpacks the specific conditions and nuances of the third point pretty thoroughly.

Basically, the document states that a token or sale is at risk of being deemed a security if its purchasers rely on the efforts of an “active participant” (i.e., a centralized entity) and if there is a “reasonable expectation of profit.” In essence, if a manager, company or some centralized entity directs the development of a cryptocurrency and is primarily responsible for its success, then it’s a security. By extension, if token holders expect the active participant to accelerate price through its managerial efforts — and if the active participant makes a promise of ownership in the project/prospect of gain and, to put it bluntly, shills the project to stimulate price appreciation — then it’s a security.

To the SEC, token price appreciation does not equate profit under the Howey Test, because price appreciation for a speculative asset comes from market forces instead of actual company operations and revenue flow.

With all of this in mind, the document confirmed what the SEC has already said when it cleared Bitcoin and Ethereum from securities status. Essentially, if a project is sufficiently decentralized, has a clear working product and the value of its token is tied to utility and not expectation of profit, then it’s not a security.

So, TLDR: if interest in your token is driven by speculation and its development is centralized, then it’s a security.",REGULATION,0.296
2019/4/4,Bitpanda Receives Payment License from the European Union,"In an official blog post published on April 4, 2019, the Viennese cryptocurrency brokerage platform Bitpanda confirmed that it has received a license to operate as a payment service provider in Austria.

Specifically, Bitpanda received the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) license, an order that provides oversight into the operation of service providers in both the European Economic Area (EEA) and the European Union.

With this license in hand, entities in the European financial and technological space can launch new products and services for customers while following clear rules on how to operate within their common market. Bitpanda’s PSD2 was issued by the Austrian financial watchdog Financial Market Authority (FMA).

Bitpanda has kept any future expansion plans under wraps, but obtaining the PSD2 license means the firm can now get a piece of the banking industry’s action and offer new payment solutions beyond its crypto offerings.

“Our goal is to bridge the gap between the modern and traditional financial world,” managing director Philipp Bohrn said, per the blog post. “The payment service provider license will allow us to tear barriers down.’’

Bitpanda’s head of financial services and co-managing director, Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, added that the company’s goals are to “make digital assets spendable anywhere [their] users want.”

2019/4/9,China’s Proposed Mining Ban Could Be Detrimental to Bitmain,"China’s state planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), has indicated an interest in banning cryptocurrency mining in the country through a notice published online in Mandarin.

The report stated that the NDRC will include cryptocurrency mining activities to a list of sectors that could be shut down based on their violation of local regulations, wastefulness, safety concerns or harmful contributions to the environment. The list includes more than 400 other industrial activities.

The list is part of the NDRC’s Catalogue for Guiding Industry Restructuring. The catalogue was issued in 2005, pointing out the activities and industries which are allowed to grow in the country or those that ought to be restricted or banned outright.

Reuters reported that the draft list has been open for public perusal since April 8, 2019, although the NDRC has not yet set a date for the elimination of cryptomining activities from the state. The draft list shows a distinct representation of the Chinese state’s views on certain industrial policies and activities, and an announcement on the NDRC’s official site claims that members of the general public now have until May 7 to provide their comments on the draft.

China was once seen as a crypto haven, thanks to the country’s abundance of mining hardware and cheap energy. But developments like this make it seem as if the country has grown cold toward industry.

Despite a blanket ban on ICOs in 2017, China has maintained dominance in the cryptomining sector, with some of the world's biggest mining companies operating from China — most notably, Bitmain. The recent notice by the NDRC has been a long time coming.

Late last year, the Xinhua News Agency reported that a study showed the impact of carbon dioxide emissions on global warming and their potential to increase temperatures by 2ºC as soon as 2033.

A separate report also claimed that authorities had seized hundreds of mining computers, after discovering they were responsible for the abnormal electricity consumption and a potential threat to the proper functioning of local power grids.

In addition, the Leading Group of Internet Financial Risks Remediation called on local governments to direct mining companies to make an ""orderly exit"" from the market.

The Chinese government has been making massive moves to stem the growth of crypto-based firms in the country for a while. The People’s Bank of China made the historic decision to place a ban on all ICOs back in 2017 and, since then, crypto companies have had to walk on regulatory eggshells.

In January 2018, a report on Bloomberg revealed that the Chinese Central Bank seemed to plan a reduction of the power supplied to bitcoin miners, in a move aimed at forcing them out of the country.

The Beijing-based Bitmain remains one of the largest manufacturers of cryptomining hardware in the world. However, the company has had to endure a torrid two years after its profits and viability were hit hard by the effects of crypto winter.

If this reported ban is enacted, it would mean that Bitmain could lose its business in China, one of its largest markets. This may prompt the company to relocate its business, something that could be difficult given its recent office closures in North America and Europe.",REGULATION,-0.5574

Bitstamp, one of the largest crypto exchange platforms in Europe, has been granted a virtual currency license from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS). The exchange became the 19th firm approved to offer crypto-based services in the world's financial center.

The regulator announced in a press release published on April 9, 2019, that it had granted Bitstamp full authorization to run its digital currency operations in New York. Bitstamp applied for BitLicense through its U.S. subsidiary.

“Bitstamp has always embraced regulatory efforts that focus on transparency and accountability to help expand the industry and bridge the gap between the traditional financial and cryptocurrency worlds,” Nejc Kodrič, CEO of Bitstamp, said in the release.

With this license, Bitstamp will be able to offer New Yorkers trading options for bitcoin, XRP, ether, bitcoin cash and litecoin through its services. In addition, the exchange is also free to add trading pairs for other digital assets in the future.

NYSDFS established the BitLicense to provide the same level of security to crypto investors as the ones that oversee conventional financial institutions.

2019/4/11,Bittrex Goes on the Offensive After BitLicense Rejection,"Bittrex, a United States–based cryptocurrency exchange platform, has issued a response to the recent setback in its plans to expand to New York.

Yesterday, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) rejected the exchange's BitLicense application, a requirement for offering crypto-based services to New Yorkers.

NYDFS also published a letter addressed to Bittrex CEO Bill Shihara, where it cited inadequate Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) standards as reasons for its denial.

Bittrex had applied for the permit in August 2015 and had been operating in New York under BitLicense's safe harbor provision while awaiting approval to be a licensed bitcoin service provider in the state.

In its official response to the agency, Bittrex expressed its disappointment at this setback, disagreeing with the state regulator’s assessment of its AML and KYC standards.

“Bittrex is saddened and disappointed in today’s decision by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), which we believe harms rather than protects New York customers. Bittrex fully disputes the findings of the NYDFS in today’s decision. We have worked diligently with NYDFS to address their questions and meet their requirements since first applying for our BitLicense in August of 2015.”
The U.S.-based exchange stated that it maintains a risk assessment framework that has been evaluated and approved by an external counsel, and it trains employees on its AML procedures and policies.

Bittrex also pointed out that all Specially Designated Nationals (SDNs) — a list of individuals and companies monitored by the U.S. government — are properly screened whenever a new account is opened, in line with the policies of the OFAC.

The exchange faulted the terms of a supervisory agreement that was proposed by the state regulator back in January, which would have resulted in the issuance of the permit to the firm. The exchange had rejected the agreement based on issues it had with the requirements.

Among other things, the agreement had capitalization requirements that were significantly higher than was required in other states. Per the post, the agency's capital requirements were ""based upon a pre-existing formula of hot wallet v. cold wallet storage"" that didn't consider the diverse range of cryptos listed on Bittrex and the ""risks of frequently moving assets from hot to cold storage.”",REGULATION,-0.7579
2019/4/12,Bitcoin Trader Sentenced to Two-Year Prison Term,"Bitcoin trader Jacob Burrell Campos was sentenced on April 8, 2019, to serve a two-year prison sentence and to forfeit more than $800,000 “for operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.”

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced the conclusion of this case on its official website, claiming that Campos had already been in custody without bail for eight months prior to this verdict. He entered a guilty plea in late October, the DOJ stated, “admitting that he operated a Bitcoin exchange without registering with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of the U.S. Department of Treasury, and without implementing the required anti-money laundering safeguards.”

A Mexican-born, U.S. citizen, Campos moved more than $1 million between the two nations with the help of several associates, all without reporting the transfers. Other than this, however, the majority of the actual crimes the DOJ charged him with involve the running of what is essentially an unlicensed exchange, with no anti-money laundering or due diligence measures.

The DOJ has long shown interest in financial crimes that involve crypto assets and prosecuting criminals using new methods. As early as 2015, for example, when the value of one bitcoin had yet to surpass $1,000, the DOJ hosted a summit for regulators, law enforcement and cryptocurrency stakeholders. Its efforts to stay on top of the crypto industry have persisted ever since, particularly with the department launching an investigation into price manipulation in 2018.

The prosecution’s main argument in the Campos case followed this trend, claiming that “unlicensed money transmitters pose a serious threat to the integrity of the U.S. financial system by creating a hole in the anti-money laundering regulatory scheme and allowing criminals to launder their cash proceeds without scrutiny.”

This verdict sets a clear precedent that a certain threshold of direct peer-to-peer exchanges of crypto for cash can open one up to prosecution.

David Shaw, a special agent for homeland security investigations in San Diego, called the trial a “reminder to those illegal and unlicensed money transmitters that the laws and rules apply to cryptocurrency dealings just as they do to other types of financial transactions,” per the DOJ announcement.

2019/4/17,Cartoon: Distorting Mirrors,"To many on the outside, the blockchain industry and speculative crypto markets are one and the same, which often leads to misunderstandings. For the two entities that regulate the market, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the result is that they tend to either look at the whole industry as an ""unregulated mess"" or view it with concerns about fraud or ""operational risk."" Ultimately, regulators view the blockchain industry through distorting mirrors.",REGULATION,-0.6705
